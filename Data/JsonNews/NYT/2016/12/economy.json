{"Headline": "Fed Raises Key Interest Rate, Citing Strengthening Economy", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for just the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, saying the American economy is expanding at a healthy pace and setting itself up as a counterweight to President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s push for considerably faster growth.The Fed cited the steady growth of employment and other economic measures, and signaled that it expects to raise rates more quickly next year to prevent the economy from growing too quickly.\u201cMy colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the announcement. \u201cWe expect the economy will continue to perform well.\u201dThe widely expected decision moves the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, still very low by historical standards. Low rates support economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking.The American economy has expanded by about 2 percent a year over the last six years, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent. The Fed\u2019s assessment that the economy is growing at a healthy pace \u2014 not too hot, not too cold \u2014 is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump, who has promised 4 percent growth and has described job creation as \u201cterrible\u201d and economic growth as anemic.Already on Wednesday, one Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Roger Williams of Texas, criticized the Fed\u2019s move.\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Fed to raise the interest rate is entirely premature and will be burdensome to a nation already struggling to pull itself out of this slow-growth Obama economy,\u201d Mr. Williams said in a statement. \u201cBy making rates even higher, the Fed is effectively making our hardships even harder.\u201dMr. Williams did not object when the Fed raised rates last December.For the first time in recent years, however, there is a real possibility of significant changes in fiscal policy. Republicans will control the White House and both chambers of Congress, and Mr. Trump has promised to increase economic growth and job creation through tax cuts and infrastructure spending.Those measures could spur faster growth after a presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump regularly disparaged the economy\u2019s performance under President Obama. But the Fed reiterated Wednesday that the economy is already expanding at roughly the maximum sustainable pace.\u201cYour expectation should depend very little on what you think that the F.O.M.C. is thinking and very much on your view of Trump policies and their macro effects,\u201d said Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on the Fed. As James Carville regularly reminded the other Clinton on the campaign trail: It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201dMs. Yellen emphasized that the Fed was not prejudging the likely course of events. She declined several times to comment on the merits of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans or to predict their consequences for the economy.\u201cWe\u2019re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The combination of steady growth and faster rate increases indicates that some Fed officials expect the central bank to end up offsetting a modest increase in fiscal stimulus. But Ms. Yellen said most Fed officials were reserving judgment.\u201cChanges in fiscal policy or other economic policies could affect the economic outlook,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, it is far too early to know how those changes will unfold.\u201dExactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.The tensions between monetary and fiscal policy will develop slowly. Legislation takes time to write, and any economic impact would generally be felt in coming years. Political pressures, however, may build more quickly.Mr. Trump has made clear in the past that he likes low interest rates \u2014 and some of his plans, like infrastructure investment, will be much easier to fund if rates remain low.\u201cThe Fed is in a tricky place,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cThey\u2019re trying not to prejudge how Congress and the administration duke it out, but once they see that, I think they will respond.\u201dThere is also uncertainty about the Fed\u2019s leadership. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman ends in February 2018, and Mr. Trump has said he would prefer a Republican.Ms. Yellen could remain on the board, a possibility she said Wednesday she had not ruled out. But the Fed, under different leadership, might well choose a different path forward. Some conservative economists, notably John Taylor of Stanford University, argue that the bank should already have raised rates above 1 percent.The economy, for now, keeps plodding along. Steady job growth has reduced the unemployment rate to a level the Fed considers healthy. A little unemployment is natural as people change jobs and businesses close. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have said they see some signs of stronger wage growth. Inflation, too, has picked up a little in recent months, although both wages and inflation continue to rise more slowly than the Fed would like to see.Ms. Yellen described the rate increase as \u201ca vote of confidence in the economy.\u201dThe decision was made by a unanimous vote of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the first time in recent months the Fed has acted by consensus.Some economists argue that the Fed should wait until inflation strengthens before raising rates, to test whether a stronger economy would persuade some people sidelined during the downturn to start looking for jobs. That would expand the labor force. Unemployment remains particularly high among minorities.That view, however, has found little support among Fed officials, who worry that interest rates will have to be raised more quickly if they wait too long, increasing the chances of pushing the economy into recession.\u201cApparently, Fed officials think the economy is growing too quickly,\u201d said Ady Barkan, the director of Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups that has pressed the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign. \u201cI doubt you can find many other Americans who share that opinion. And it\u2019s a strange conclusion to draw in the wake of an election that was so heavily impacted by voters\u2019 economic discontent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Brutal Year in Venezuela, Even Crime Fighters Are Killers", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The soldiers barged into Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s home as his mother and girlfriend looked on. It would be a routine questioning, they assured him and others arrested that night, before hauling them off to a dark military barracks.What happened next was anything but normal, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez recalled.He was stripped naked, kicked and struck with the butt of a rifle, he said. Soldiers hung him by his arms from the ceiling with a cord, demanding to know whether he belonged to one of the gangs that had terrorized his neighborhood in Venezuela\u2019s rural area of Barlovento with robberies and kidnappings.\u201cThey told me: \u2018We are going to play a game, Little Rafael. It is called electrocution,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who is 17. \u201cThey shocked me on the abdomen, the neck, the penis, the butt, the back, my hands \u2014 everywhere. I felt like my eardrums would explode.\u201dOn Oct. 21, five days after he was arrested, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, bruised and terrified, was released, he said.He would soon realize that he was among the lucky ones. Weeks later, the bodies of 13 others arrested in similar raids were found, most at the bottom of a mass grave. Many had been tortured, according to the authorities.\u201cImagine how I felt as a mother,\u201d said Petra P\u00e9rez, whose 18-year-old son, Anthony Vargas, was found dead, his body partly decomposed. \u201cI\u2019d had a little hope that my son was still alive, that my son was not in that lot.\u201dThe killings at Barlovento, which government investigators have condemned as a massacre of innocents, have pointed to a troubling culprit in the country\u2019s rising violence: its own security forces.Killings have risen to 28,479 this year, the highest number ever recorded in the country, according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an independent group that tracks violence.Some of these armed groups were once anchors of government support in the barrios. These so-called colectivos started as community groups and were eventually armed by members of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s movement, enabling their rise as militant defenders of the government.But after Mr. Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013 and Venezuela\u2019s economy began to spiral downward, some of his loyal street enforcers increasingly turned to crime, breaking with the government and joining a constellation of armed groups that kidnap, steal and kill.In a bid to restore order, the government has turned to the institution it trusts the most: the military. Throughout the country, the armed forces have become Venezuela\u2019s law keepers, engaging in commando-style raids that sometimes take on the profile of urban warfare.\u201cIt has become more militaristic and more repressive,\u201d Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a Venezuelan political scientist, said. \u201cAnyone can be caught.\u201d\u201cWe are walking on the path to a failed state,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will come to a point where no one is in control.\u201dTarek William Saab, a government ombudsman investigating the Barlovento case, said the victims were innocent men and women subjected to \u201cthe most unfortunate cases of cruelty and inhuman denigrations of torture.\u201dThe authorities have said 18 soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel and a captain, had been arrested in connection with the killings. All will be brought to justice in Venezuela\u2019s courts, Mr. Saab said, but he argued that the massacre was not part of a broader pattern of abuse.Human rights groups and survivors of other raids strongly dispute that, saying the military has killed hundreds of people, many of them innocent.Representatives of Venezuela\u2019s military and national guard did not respond to requests for interviews. But one organization, Provea, which tracks deaths in raids by monitoring official statistics and local news reports, said more than 600 people had been killed this year in episodes like the one in Barlovento, up from about 245 in 2015.The New York Times interviewed 10 victims of raids and members of their families who detailed a similar pattern of abuse. They described arbitrary detentions, violent interrogations and killings by security forces.Rosinis Morales, 39, recalled a raid on Oct. 6 in her barrio in the capital, Caracas, saying security forces broke into her home and ordered the men inside to go with them. She said they had shot and killed her husband, Jos\u00e9 Alberto Gordillo, 32; her brother, Heller Morales, 34; and a family friend, Johnary Cardozo, 23. The government later said nine people it described as criminals had been killed in the raid.Asdrubal Granados, 51, said his 25-year-old son, Yanderson, had been arrested during another raid that day in a different part of Caracas. Mr. Granados said the family had tried to find the son, who had previously been convicted of a robbery, by calling police stations, to no avail. He was later found in the morgue, shot to death, Mr. Granados said.On Aug. 17, 2015, security forces raided the home of Joel Antonio Torrealba and his son \u00c1ngel Joel, 15, around 2 a.m. on Margarita Island on the country\u2019s central coast, according to the father. He said they had shot his son dead while he had been in bed. \u201cHe was just sleeping,\u201d Mr. Torrealba said.Mr. Torrealba said he, his wife and his daughter, 21, had been arrested, only to be released in an abandoned lot far from their homes, with no explanation.But none of these raids have resulted in the same kind of public accusations as in the Barlovento case, in which both victims and the authorities have cited beatings, torture and homicide.It all began on television. On Oct. 10, N\u00e9stor Reverol, the country\u2019s powerful interior minister, released a video in which he stood before soldiers and armored vehicles, announcing that he would send nearly 1,400 members of the security forces into six municipalities.\u201cIt\u2019s an important deployment that will run the entire axis of Barlovento,\u201d said Mr. Reverol, a military general who is wanted in the United States on charges that he aided drug traffickers.Barlovento, a stretch of the coastal plains east of Caracas, is a cluster of towns and villages where the capital\u2019s urban areas give way to farms cultivating cacao. But rising crime had shattered the countryside idyll. Residents said they were terrorized by armed gangs who regularly robbed farmers, carjacked vehicles and held villagers for ransom.Few suspected there was anything to fear from the arrival of the soldiers, whom they believed had been sent to help them.\u201cIt was the first time something like this had happened to us,\u201d Ms. P\u00e9rez said.Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, the 17-year-old who said he had been shocked with electricity, was among the first arrested on Oct. 16. He had been spending the evening burning the family\u2019s trash nearby and had just returned home when, he and his mother said, two soldiers entered the living room and forced him into a jeep.A five-day ordeal began, he said. At the military barracks, he said, he was stripped naked and photographed. Around 10 p.m. he said, he and five others were taken to a jail where the soldiers tied his arms together, threw him on the ground and stomped on his head.\u201cIf you scream, it will only get worse,\u201d he said one of them had warned.They stripped him naked again and blindfolded him, he said, and then poured buckets of water onto his face, asking him if he had anything to confess.\u201cI knew nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just a quiet kid and didn\u2019t run around with anyone.\u201dIn another room, with his eyes covered, he was given electric shocks for about 40 minutes as the soldiers continued to press him about Barlovento\u2019s gangs, he said.\u201c\u2018If you are going to kill us, do it now, but don\u2019t keep us suffering this way. Not even dogs would do this,\u2019\u201d he recalled pleading.Around the same time, security forces were catching others in Barlovento.On Oct. 15, Carlos Marchena, a 20-year-old who worked at his family\u2019s trucking company, was holding a small party when soldiers entered and forced the men to kneel, according to his widow, Mayerlin Pita. They took the men\u2019s identification cards and loaded them into trucks. It was the last time she saw her husband alive, she said.The next day, Luis Sanz, a 30-year-old mechanic, was arrested by soldiers, members of his family said. Seven or eight soldiers in ski masks raided the house, his sister Alimirely Sanz said, pushing everyone aside except for Mr. Sanz. Luc\u00eda Espinoza, his mother, said she had been thrown to the floor in the melee.\u201c\u2018You mothers are the accomplices; you go about aiding and abetting,\u2019\u201d Ms. Espinoza said the soldiers had told her before taking her son away.The Sanz and Marchena families, along with those of many other people who had been detained, began gathering at a military barracks known as El Caf\u00e9, where they believed their loved ones were being held. For three days, they brought food, water and clothes, handing them to the soldiers in the hope they would pass the items along to the detainees.But on the third day, Ms. Pita said, she realized something had happened.The soldiers who had been accepting the food started telling relatives that they had no registry of their loved ones, or that they had been taken to a different facility, relatives said.On Oct. 18, Mr. Reverol, the interior minister, returned to television to say the operation was a success. Security forces had dismantled what he called a dangerous criminal group called \u201cThe Anthony\u201d and found a safe house being used for kidnappings.\u201cWe are keeping our promise to keep advancing, to continue liberating the people,\u201d he said.A month passed with little news. Then the bodies appeared.On Nov. 25, the authorities said, a tip led them to two corpses buried next to a highway. Ten more were found in a mass grave near a town in the area.The families of those who had disappeared went to the morgue immediately. The smell of death hung in the air as national guardsmen kept order, allowing families to enter, one at a time.Ms. Sanz said she had identified her brother by pictures of his teeth and clothes, because officials told her that the body was too badly decomposed to be viewed. Ms. Pita said a DNA test had confirmed that her husband, Mr. Marchena, was also dead.Ms. P\u00e9rez identified her son, Mr. Vargas, through a number of tattoos, one on his chest.\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d she said.The death certificates of Mr. Sanz and Mr. Vargas, reviewed by The Times, said they had been killed by stab wounds to the neck. Mr. Marchena was killed by a shot to the head, according to his family.\u201cThey killed them like animals,\u201d Ms. P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThat\u2019s how my son died.\u201dMr. Saab, the government investigator, said the events were evidence that the military should not be involved in fighting street crime.\u201cThe army doesn\u2019t have the preparation or the professional capacity to do crime prevention,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not trained to do it.\u201dOn Nov. 29, the remains of Mr. Vargas and Mr. Sanz were buried in their town, Capaya, along with two others. Much of the town came out for the procession, as the coffins wound past mud homes and a barracks where a dozen soldiers stood guard \u2014 the same one where the men were originally taken.The caravan stopped several times as mourners looked out from their homes. Several motorcycle taxi drivers drove circles around their coffins, in a sign of respect.\u201cAnthony, my son, stand up and dance to your music,\u201d Ms. P\u00e9rez screamed.Moments later, the coffins were lowered into the ground.Ana Vanessa Herrero, Patricia Torres and Meredith Kohut contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Dream, Quantified at Last", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byThe phrase \u201cAmerican dream\u201d was invented during the Great Depression. It comes from a popular 1931 book by the historian James Truslow Adams, who defined it as \u201cthat dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone.\u201dIn the decades that followed, the dream became a reality. Thanks to rapid, widely shared economic growth, nearly all children grew up to achieve the most basic definition of a better life \u2014 earning more money and enjoying higher living standards than their parents had.These days, people are arguably more worried about the American dream than at any point since the Depression. But there has been no real measure of it, despite all of the data available. No one has known how many Americans are more affluent than their parents were \u2014 and how the number has changed.It\u2019s a thorny research question, because it requires tracking individual families over time rather than (as most economic statistics do) taking one-time snapshots of the country.The index is deeply alarming. It\u2019s a portrait of an economy that disappoints a huge number of people who have heard that they live in a country where life gets better, only to experience something quite different.Yet the data also helps point the way to some promising solutions.The few 1940 children who earned less than their parents were also, for the most part, doing just fine. They were generally earning less because they had grown up rich \u2014 children of top corporate executives, say, who became, or married, doctors, lawyers or professors.Achieving the American dream was a virtual guarantee for this generation, regardless of whether people went to college, got divorced or suffered a layoff. Why? Because they spent their prime working years in an economy with two wonderful features. It was growing rapidly, and the bounty from its growth flowed to the rich, the middle class and the poor alike.Not even the oldest baby boomers, born in the late 1940s and early 1950s, would be quite so lucky. Economic growth began to slow as they were entering the job market in the 1970s, thanks in part to the energy crises. Still, more than three-quarters of these early Baby Boomers would ultimately make more than their parents.You can see the effects on the American dream in the charts here. Each line shows the percentage of children born in a given year who out-earned their parents, with children who grew up poor on the left and rich on the right. The line steadily falls over time, across every economic class.For babies born in 1980 \u2014 today\u2019s 36-year-olds \u2014 the index of the American dream has fallen to 50 percent: Only half of them make as much money as their parents did. In the industrial Midwestern states that effectively elected Donald Trump, the share was once higher than the national average. Now, it is a few percentage points lower. There, going backward is the norm.Psychology research has shown that people\u2019s happiness is heavily influenced by their relative station in life. And it\u2019s hard to imagine a more salient comparison than to a person\u2019s own parents, particularly at this time of year, when families gather for rituals that have been repeated for decades. \u201cYou\u2019re going home for the holidays and you compare your standard of living to your parents,\u201d Grusky, a sociologist, says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few ties you have over the course of your entire life. Friends come and go. Parents are a constant.\u201dHow, then, can the country revive Adams\u2019s dream of a \u201cbetter and richer and fuller\u201d life for everyone? The solution has to involve some combination of faster economic growth and more widely shared growth.The bad news is that lifting G.D.P. growth is terribly difficult. Trump has promised to do so, but offered few specifics. If anything, he favors some of the same policies (deregulation and tax cuts) that have failed in recent decades.The better news \u2014 potentially \u2014 is that lifting growth is the less important half of the equation, notes Nathaniel Hendren of Harvard, another of the researchers: The rise of inequality has damaged the American dream more than the growth slowdown.One way to think about inequality\u2019s role is to remember that the American economy is far larger and more productive than in 1980, even if it isn\u2019t growing as rapidly. Per-capita G.D.P. is almost twice as high now. By itself, that increase should allow most children to live better than their parents.They don\u2019t, however, because the fruits of growth have gone disproportionately to the affluent.The researchers ran a clever simulation recreating the last several decades with the same G.D.P. growth but without the post-1970 rise in inequality. When they did, the share of 1980 babies who grew up to out-earn their parents jumped to 80 percent, from 50 percent. The rise was considerably smaller (to 62 percent) in the simulation that kept inequality constant but imagined that growth returned to its old, faster path.\u201cWe need to have more equal growth if we want to revive the American dream,\u201d Chetty says.If the American dream could survive the Depression, and then thrive in a way few people imagined, it can survive our current troubles.Kevin Quealy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Extends Bond-Buying Program to Protect Eurozone Economy", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would buy large quantities of bonds and other assets for longer than planned but would cut the size of the purchases, a decision it insisted did not a signal that a much anticipated \u201ctapering\u201d of stimulus measures had begun.\u201cTapering\u201d is a loaded word in financial circles. By buying enormous amounts of bonds in recent months, the European Central Bank has kept market interest rates low, part of efforts to encourage lending and bolster economic growth in the 19-country eurozone. But by reducing its purchases over time, it could limit or reverse this effect.It recalls the so-called taper tantrum in the United States in 2013 after Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that the American central bank would begin reducing its asset purchases. Market turmoil followed as investors sold Treasury bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates.\u201cThere is no question about tapering,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference. \u201cTapering has not been discussed today.\u201dThe response on financial markets showed that investors did not believe Mr. Draghi\u2019s rejection of the word, at least initially.Although the central bank extended the time frame for asset purchases to the end of 2017 from March, investors focused on plans to reduce the asset purchases beginning in April to 60 billion euros, or about $64 billion, from \u20ac80 billion.Markets settled down after Mr. Draghi said that he defined tapering as \u201ca process where purchases would go to zero.\u201d\u201cThat has not been discussed,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is no tapering in sight. The E.C.B. is going to stay in the markets.\u201dEuropean stocks rose and the yields on eurozone government bonds receded after Mr. Draghi offered those reassurances. Analysts who had initially declared the beginning of tapering modified their views.\u201cAt first glance, today\u2019s decisions looked, walked and quacked like tapering,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, chief German economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. \u201cDraghi gave his best to convince everyone that it is not tapering. We tend to believe him.\u201dBelow are other issues that have raised concerns among some economists, investors and central bankers.\u201cUncertainty prevails everywhere.\u201d\u2014 Mario Draghi, warning that despite inflation rising, the eurozone economy is still fragile.Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that inflation would rise next year along with the price of oil. That is allowing the central bank to reduce the size of its asset purchases, which are a form of money printing.But he also suggested the eurozone economy still was a long way from being in good health.Signs of higher inflation have already prompted some economists to press for cuts to the bond buying, which critics say has distorted prices. When the European Central Bank ends the so-called quantitative easing program, they say, the shock to bond prices could destabilize the fragile eurozone economy.The central bank\u2019s \u201cargument in favor of bond purchases no longer holds for 2017,\u201d Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an economic research group in Munich, said in a statement. \u201cThe negative side effects of the E.C.B.\u2019s bond purchases will come to the fore.\u201d\u201cOur view is that easing monetary conditions should help undertaking structural reform.\u201d\u2014 Mr. Draghi, arguing that central bank policies have given political leaders more space to push through changes.As he has for years, Mr. Draghi beseeched leaders of eurozone countries to take steps to help their economies grow faster, warning that the European Central Bank cannot guarantee the health of the common currency area on its own.Resistance to overhauls in Italy, as well as in France, has strengthened the arguments of those who say that European Central Bank support for the eurozone economy has allowed national leaders to procrastinate rather than deal with the region\u2019s problems, such as high government debt or laws that stifle entrepreneurship.Mr. Draghi rejected those arguments on Thursday.\u201cVulnerabilities in the Italian banking system have been there a long time. They will be dealt with.\u201d\u2014 Mr. Draghi, offering restrained assurances that problems facing Italian banks can be solved.If investors demand higher premiums to buy government bonds, the increase in borrowing costs are likely to ripple through credit markets and make it more difficult for businesses in the eurozone to grow.One of the biggest fears in the wake of the Italian vote, and the resignation on Wednesday of the country\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was that political uncertainty would upset plans to pump fresh capital into struggling Italian banks.Mr. Draghi said those banks could be fixed \u2014 the European Central Bank functions as the eurozone\u2019s supreme bank overseer, and it is ultimately responsible for the health of the area\u2019s banking system.But Mr. Draghi also listed all the risks threatening global stability, including Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union and the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States. Mr. Draghi described the president-elect as having a \u201cradical\u201d new view of the world.\u201cI think what central banks can do,\u201d he said, \u201cis keep a steady hand.\u201dAn article on Friday about the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying program misstated the actions taken by investors in 2013 after the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggested that the American central bank would begin reducing asset purchases. Investors sold Treasury bonds; they did not buy them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Honeymoon Begins: Confidence in the Economy Is Booming", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byConsumers say they are more confident. Business leaders, once wary, are now expressing excitement that one of their own is headed toward the White House. And Wall Street is bordering on the ecstatic.A month after Donald J. Trump\u2019s election, a series of pro-business cabinet nominations, along with promises to cut taxes, roll back regulations, invest in infrastructure and negotiate better trade deals, have conjured up the possibility, some executives say, of a \u201cField of Dreams\u201d economy.The recent heart-pumping stock rally, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said at an investment conference this week, is \u201cbased upon the hope, which I hope is accurate, that the Trump administration will be very good for unleashed business per se,\u201d and may improve overall growth.Mr. Dimon and a raft of other Wall Street stalwarts have either joined the new administration or taken on advisory roles, damping down their worries that the bankers-as-boogeymen campaign language would be transformed into action.The economic field that Mr. Trump and Republican leaders are building could have widely different effects on bankers, business owners and workers, depending on their skill level, industry and location. Possibly even their race or ethnicity, considering the president-elect\u2019s attacks on immigrants and Muslims.The months between the election and the inauguration of any new president, particularly one from the opposing party, are always swollen with anticipation. While Trump critics and skeptics brace for their worst, supporters can happily indulge their hopes for the best.The bitter political divide continues, but its impact on the economic outlook is not as sharp.With Republicans about to take control of both the White House and Congress, business expects an end to the Washington stalemate and a shift in policies in its direction.\u201cUncertainty about the regulatory environment and tax policy is what can cause paralysis,\u201d said Dan Houston, chief executive of Principal Financial Group, a financial management company headquartered in Des Moines. \u201cJust understanding what the ground rules are going to be can make a difference. There seems to be a feeling that there\u2019s going to be more clarity in the first half of 2017.\u201dCentral Iowa has already been booming with one of the lowest unemployment rates and highest growth rates in the country. But employers have been further buoyed since the election by the belief that imminent tax cuts and fewer regulations will further rev up the economy, Mr. Houston said.\u201cIf you are a Republican, this is the beginning of a golden age,\u201d Mr. Sabato said.With unemployment falling and wage gains picking up in the last couple of years, Democrats were growing much more upbeat about the economy. Some are now more pessimistic, with Pew showing those who think the economy will get better next year declining to 15 percent from 35 percent. But that drop was not enough to offset the Republican surge.\u201cIs it just two ships passing in the night?\u201d Mr. Sabato asked about the sudden enthusiasm about the economy.But Wall Street and business are particularly pumped by the prospect of an end to Washington gridlock. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant Blackstone and chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s panel of business experts, said at an investor conference that change was coming.\u201cI anticipate with a pretty high level of confidence that this stuff is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is as big a change happening all at once \u2014 I\u2019ve been in finance for, I don\u2019t know, 45 years? This would be the biggest.\u201dBut it is also true that Blackstone, with its giant portfolio of real estate assets and operating companies that span the world, is closely attuned to the American economy\u2019s potential to grow.The industrial sector is also enthusiastic. Listen to Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers: \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for a builder and leader like President-elect Trump to take a proactive, hands-on and personal approach to supporting manufacturers in America.\u201dIn any case, celebration or despair over next year\u2019s economy is not only premature, it is also not easily controlled. In fact, most of the seeds for its performance in the near future have already been sown.\u201cWhatever happened in the economy in the last few weeks or months,\u201d Mr. Wilkof of Stark Industrial in Ohio said, \u201cdidn\u2019t just happen in the last few weeks or months.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a steady decline in jobless claims, and the unemployment rolls continue to diminish,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the economy is not in a bad position now. My hope is that it is going to grow and be strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Great Deal for the Many", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byIF Donald Trump could script his presidency, every week would probably look like the one just past. You get on the phone with some corporate big shot who\u2019s considering closing a plant in the Rust Belt. You offer some carrots, you threaten implicitly, you make a deal: Jobs stay, factories don\u2019t close, and maybe next time they even open. (Nothing will make Trump happier than the day he gets Apple to open a minor widget factory in Wisconsin.) Then you hold a big rally, brag about your dealmaking prowess, promise that C.E.O.s won\u2019t be shipping jobs overseas with impunity anymore \u2026 and then fly back to Trump Tower and wait for the next opportunity to do it all again.Unfortunately this is not an optimal approach to economic policy. It ignores deep Hayekian insights about the problems inherent in picking winners and punishing losers from on high. It expands an economy of favors and phone calls in which insiders will inevitably profit more than innovators. It embodies the crony capitalism that only yesterday Republicans opposed.But strong-arming individual companies also isn\u2019t going to do that much to help the mass of heartland voters to whom he promised a Trumpian New Deal. Saving jobs that Carrier planned to ship to Mexico is a meaningful thing for the workers involved. But even if you scale up the same deal-making dramatically, you\u2019re still talking about a footnote to the unemployment rate and average wage.However: It is possible for policy makers to raise take-home pay directly even without big boosts in the underlying wages. Cutting payroll taxes would do it. The earned-income tax credit does it. Middle-class tax cuts do it. Child tax credits do it. A wage subsidy would do it. The list of possibilities is long.Several of those possibilities are immediately available to Trump, if he wants to reach for them. His daughter\u2019s child-care subsidy could be reconfigured to deliver more to the working class; it could be combined with the larger earned-income tax credit envisioned by Paul Ryan or the wage subsidy that Marco Rubio is championing, and both could be folded into a tax reform that makes good on Trump\u2019s Treasury nominee\u2019s recent promise to prioritize middle-class tax cuts over tax cuts for the rich.None of this would solve the long-term dilemma of slow wage growth. But it would make it immediately easier, often to the tune of thousands of dollars a year, for Americans who aren\u2019t employed by companies amenable to Trumpian jawboning to pay bills, raise children, take vacations, and pursue the American Dream.Advertisement"}

Leaks, Calpers Cuts Targets", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump has named:\u2022 Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing American trade and industrial policy.\u2022 Carl Icahn, the investor, to serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues.Mr. Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, is the only credentialed economist in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle. He has argued that China is effectively waging economic war by subsidizing exports to the United States and impeding imports from it. He has also made a documentary called \u201cDeath by China,\u201d in which an animation of a Chinese knife stabs a map of the United States.The appointment highlights a division among Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers.Like Mr. Navarro, Wilbur Ross, the president-elect\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, favors increased trade restrictions. But Mr. Trump\u2019s broader circle of advisers is dominated by proponents of free trade.Mr. Icahn, who made his fortune as a \u201ccorporate raider,\u201d will play a role in the selection of a new leader for the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is the regulator that serves as the referee for his battles with corporations.One of those labor agreements provides a union contract to workers at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas (the hotel had previously refused to bargain with the union). The second agreement eases a hurdle to unionization at a recently opened Trump hotel in Washington.It looked to be another prominent insider trading case brought by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.William T. Walters, the Las Vegas sports bettor, was charged with using illegal stock tips, but the judge in the case essentially instructed Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyers to file a motion to dismiss the case.The case has been marred by revelations that a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation leaked details of the inquiry to reporters at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times two years before Mr. Walters was indicted.If the charges are dismissed, it would be another stunning legal victory for Mr. Walters. He has faced charges before, mostly arising from his gambling business, but has not been convicted.\u201cOdebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit \u2014 a \u2018Department of Bribery,\u2019 so to speak \u2014 that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents.\u201dWith $300 billion in assets and the investments of more than 1.7 million current and future retirees under management, it is the biggest public fund outside the federal government. Other pension systems may well follow suit.Calpers is also changing its business plan so that it covers less of the cost of pensions. Local governments and public workers will have to chip in more.The shift by Calpers to 7 percent, from 7.5 percent, will do little to satisfy critics of its methodology who argue that the expected returns should be based on safe investments like Treasury securities, which are nearer the 2.5 percent mark.Advertisement"}

He jailed thousands of political opponents and killed many others.But for all of that brutality and intolerance, he brought development and equality to a nation previously ruled by extreme inequality and corruption. Sons and daughters of illiterate plantation workers became doctors and teachers and contributed to large gains in human development, while corrupt officials and robber barons who had drained the old Cuba were forced to leave.Despite America\u2019s attempted invasion, multiple assassination attempts, he defied a superpower, his government survives successive American administrations, and, importantly, he died at 90 of natural causes. Love or hate him, we all wish we had a little piece of Fidel in us.He failed the test that Abraham Lincoln alluded to in his famous quote: \u201cNearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u201dFrom budding revolutionary concerned with overthrowing a corrupt dictator, he became what he himself despised. This is the lesson to us all.My family suffered numerous losses under Fidel\u2019s dictatorship. He was responsible for so much devastation, suffering and death in Cuba.I\u2019m not celebrating the death of a human being, I\u2019m celebrating the end of an oppressive era in my native country. I hope real change will finally come to the island.Instead of talking about recounts, unqualified cabinet picks, white supremacist top aides and perhaps worst of all the wholesale corruption of Trump\u2019s merging of business interests with the presidency, we are now talking about flag burning \u2014 at its core an established non-issue that will inflame emotions and act as an effective distraction that takes attention away from the monstrous actions of this monstrous future president.This comment received 1,600 reader recommendations.I suppose there is a season for everything, but meanwhile the polar ice caps are melting, the nation\u2019s seniors are in danger of losing Medicare and Social Security, the middle class is about to be slammed with taxes again, education looks like going the way of Michigan.Well guess what: The president doesn\u2019t legally have any conflict of interest. He made it clear he is a businessman with lots of property around the world and a worldwide brand. He is the keeper of that brand, good or bad. His kids hold important positions in these businesses and apparently he knows a lot more people around the world than the media gave him credit for.Leave him be so he can get his administration put together. He has shown that he knows quite a bit more than the media elite now, hasn\u2019t he?Want to try that new restaurant with your spouse?

{"Headline": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Team Trump\u2019s New Pledge on Tax Cuts", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byLast week, though, Steven Mnuchin said something unexpected on CNBC, in his first interview after becoming Donald Trump\u2019s choice for Treasury secretary. A friendly host invited Mnuchin to respond to the liberal charge that Trump\u2019s tax cut was a sop to the rich. Mnuchin, a financier and former Goldman Sachs partner, refused \u2014 and made news instead.This is now a clear standard by which any Trump tax cut should be judged.What will Trump actually do? Who knows. Regardless, though, Mnuchin\u2019s position is telling. At most, it suggests that Trump\u2019s advisers are trying to figure out how to govern. At least, it indicates some of them realize that a tax cut for the rich is problematic, both economically and politically.This concentration of income means that top earners are ever more important to the country\u2019s fiscal condition. Cutting their taxes will worsen the long-term deficit and leave less money for programs that really do lift economic growth, like infrastructure, scientific research and education.For all of these reasons, I would prefer taxes to increase at the top (while falling for middle- and low-income families). But I recognize that the election results make that idea implausible for now. And if you favor a smaller government than I do, you can make a real argument for an approach like Mnuchin\u2019s: lower rates and fewer deductions.What if Mnuchin\u2019s comments are meaningless or a con \u2014 and Trump hopes to sign a deficit-busting, inequality-increasing tax plan? In that case, Democrats and fiscally conservative Republicans should fight hard against the plan and refuse any compromise.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Win a Senate Race", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byIt takes a certain force of will to turn away, even briefly, from the burlesque of Donald Trump\u2019s transition into the presidency. But that\u2019s not the entirety of American politics, just as his election wasn\u2019t the lone political story of 2016. Other contests had important lessons. One especially draws my eye.It was a gigantic win for Republicans, who will use it as a model. But Democrats can learn as much from it, because it mirrored some mistakes they made nationwide.I\u2019m referring to Senator Rob Portman\u2019s re-election in Ohio. His seat was one that Democrats identified early as a potential steal, and through much of 2015 and 2016, political analysts tagged the race as one of the most competitive in the country. But he ended up winning by 21 points.Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Ohio by a smaller margin of eight points, so Portman didn\u2019t merely surf a Republican wave. And while the Democratic Party essentially gave up on the race two months before Election Day, diverting money elsewhere, that didn\u2019t fully explain the size of Portman\u2019s victory. Nor did his formidable war chest of funds.He and his team prevailed with a series of smart decisions and a conviction \u2014 borne out by the results \u2014 that even in these viciously polarized times, there remain voters who are moved less by partisan fever than by whether a candidate seems to be duly and humbly focused on them and their particular problems.\u201cI very much believe \u2014 no offense to anyone \u2014 that Rob Portman ran the best campaign in America,\u201d Matthew Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, told me.\u201cPeople think this world of campaigns is like these stupid movies and, at some point, some grand decision suddenly tips the scales: a particular ad, a particular event,\u201d he noted. But what Portman did, he said, was toil away, methodically and precisely, with one question above all others in mind: What\u2019s the path to the most votes?He never let vanity tug him away from that path. He was ruthlessly disciplined and relentlessly practical. That\u2019s not a sexy formula, but more often than not, it\u2019s a winning one.Portman\u2019s victory was hardly pretty \u2014 victory often isn\u2019t. A barrage of attack ads early on branded his opponent, Ted Strickland, who governed Ohio from 2007 to 2011, a failure in office and a hostage to the liberal causes he subsequently worked for in Washington.And seemingly contradicting a history of advocacy for trade, Portman came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. He later garnered union endorsements that don\u2019t typically go to a Republican.But other factors had considerable sway, prime among them the Democrats\u2019 choice of Strickland to challenge Portman. Strickland made sense on a superficial level, and the party initially convinced itself that it had hit a home run. A former Ohio governor, he had instant name recognition and deep experience, and was guaranteed to raise gobs of money.But he was 15 years older than Portman, a fellow political insider and a lackluster campaigner. He couldn\u2019t use the most effective tactic against an incumbent and cast himself as a spirited insurgent or agent of change. Portman sometimes played the underdog: a nifty trick when your government r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is as long as his. Having Strickland as an opponent made it possible.And Strickland had been voted out of the governor\u2019s office, after one term, at a time of enormous economic pain. Portman, whose six years in the Senate coincided with an improving Ohio economy, simply had to remind voters of that. And did he ever.In early 2015, he was nine points behind Strickland in polls. By late summer 2016, he had established enough of a lead for Democrats to surrender hope. How?He said little about Trump. Once Trump was the party\u2019s de facto presidential nominee, Portman endorsed him, tersely, and that was pretty much that. Questions kept coming, from reporters eager for melodrama. But Portman and his aides kept pivoting to Portman\u2019s record and his plans, and unlike Republicans in other Senate races, they wouldn\u2019t be worn down.\u201cI would give the same succinct answer: This race isn\u2019t between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s between Rob Portman and Ted Strickland,\u201d Portman said in an interview late last week. Sticking to that took extraordinary restraint.Countering voters\u2019 cynicism that politicians are more interested in shouting at one another than in getting anything done, he presented Ohioans with a litany of bipartisan federal legislation that bore his name. He promoted a record of laws that made strides toward matters as concrete as \u201crepairing the damage of harmful algae blooms on Lake Erie or dealing in very specific ways with the heroin and drug epidemic in Ohio,\u201d he said.For that reason, among others, most of Ohio\u2019s major newspapers endorsed him over Strickland.\u201cPeople want you to get stuff done,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat gets lost in a red-and-blue world where people think you just rev up the base to win. We talked to everybody.\u201dBut in tailored, targeted ways. When I visited his campaign headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, a few days before the election, his campaign manager, Corry Bliss, took me through the data-driven crafting of some 20 different appeals to 20 kinds of voters, based on their locations and lifestyles. Maps covered the office walls, but there was no comfy furniture, no snazzy d\u00e9cor. The Portman campaign wasn\u2019t squandering any money on that.Bliss, 35, is emerging as one of his party\u2019s most closely watched young strategists. In 2014, he managed the re-election campaign of Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, who seemed destined for defeat until Bliss and others swooped in around Labor Day to overhaul the effort.One of Bliss\u2019s first interventions was to take away the dense briefing book with which Roberts was preparing for a debate and replace it with a single sheet that instructed the senator to repeat, ad nauseam, that a vote for his opponent was a vote for Barack Obama. Kansans aren\u2019t so keen on the president. On Democrats, period.A fast-talking, vivid character, Bliss is obsessed with horse racing and fond of translating its verities to politics.\u201cPace makes the race,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou only get rewarded if you\u2019re winning at the wire.\u201d And so everyone in the Portman campaign stayed calm when they were behind and didn\u2019t, for example, blow too much money in a sudden panic.\u201cDon\u2019t get caught in traffic,\u201d Bliss decreed. That\u2019s crucial for a thoroughbred and it was vital for Portman, who couldn\u2019t let Trump\u2019s antics obscure his Ohio-centric messages.These rules are no less important for being obvious, and Portman obeyed them, with a campaign that relied not on sweeping romance but on hard-nosed calculation. And on the wager, apparently correct, that you don\u2019t have to whip voters into a frenzy. You just have to convince them that you\u2019re the more determined, attentive, effective workhorse.Advertisement"}

Goodnight to-do list.\u201dWhere customers put their phone-charging beds is up to them, of course, but Ms. Huffington has some advice: somewhere other than the bedroom. \u201cIf you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, you might be tempted to look at your phone,\u201d she said. \u201cPutting the phone \u2014 putting the distraction \u2014 away from the bedroom is critical.\u201dShe sees that as a good practice not only for adults, but also for teenagers. \u201cWe now know about burnout, depression and anxiety\u201d in young people, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re fully connected to sleep deprivation. And we see what\u2019s happening in colleges \u2014 blackout drinking, suicides. These are all connected to people running on empty.\u201dThe RAND analysis said such losses were up to $138 billion in Japan and up to $60 billion in Germany. Canada appears to have the most alert work force, or at least the smallest drain on the economy from sleep problems, but the productivity loss is still sizable there: $21.4 billion, with just under 80,000 working days lost because of insufficient sleep, compared with 123 million days in this country.\u201cThe speed of life has accelerated,\u201d Ms. Huffington said. \u201cThe majority of people are depleted, distracted, unfulfilled.\u201dThen she was off on a whirlwind tour of the store.

In 2007, two years after The Huffington Post started, she collapsed from exhaustion.

The more resilient people are, the more they will make the right decisions and fight the right battles rather than fall into despair.\u201d And to be resilient, people need their rest.She was asked if she missed The Huffington Post, which she left in August to focus on Thrive Global. \u201cI\u2019m so engaged in this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only difference I would have made was modest and incremental.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages about her, she said, \u201cOh, that was so long ago.\u201d\u201cI practice what I\u2019m preaching here,\u201d she said. \u201cTo relive every offensive thing \u2014 if you\u2019re still holding on to that, you\u2019re missing the point of life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementDecember  9, 2016Gary LibecapChristine Todd WhitmanDuring the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump heralded the idea of eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. His proposed E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, frequently fought the agency as Oklahoma attorney general. But both may have forgotten that the E.P.A. was created by President Richard Nixon because people were being hospitalized in record numbers during bad air days and rivers were spontaneously combusting due to the dumping of pollutants into our waterways.  If cost-savings is our goal, we must remember that the cost of remediation is far more than prevention. The price we pay for ignoring these issues is much greater than we can afford, both in terms of dollars and human lives. We have seen a glimpse of an increasingly widespread concern for the environment in a number of recent campaigns. The sustained and widespread opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline, which would cross just upstream of the the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s drinking water supply, led the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the project and reconsider its route.While environmental protection may not have been the foremost issue animating Trump\u2019s supporters, it is important to a much larger segment of our population than ever before. Eliminating the E.P.A. altogether would be shortsighted and foolish; we need to take a longer-term view of the affects that our actions toward our surroundings have on our health and our safety \u2013 two resources that once lost cannot simply be repurchased.The American people did not elect Trump and other Republicans because they suddenly all joined the G.O.P., they voted because they wanted a change from politics as usual in Washington. President-elect Trump and congressional leaders should remember that the electorate voted against the hyper-partisanship that has rendered governing at the federal level almost impossible.  The new administration has the opportunity to make a huge difference by recognizing that the environment is not a partisan issue and real, everyday people, genuinely care about their health and quality of life.\nThere is angst in the environmental community about what President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s appointment of Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. administrator means for the agency and environmental policy. The fear is that recent efforts \u2014 ranging from implementing the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone of U.S. compliance with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, to redefining watersheds regulated under the Clean Water Act \u2014 will be rolled back or cancelled.  Broad objectives could be lost.While these two efforts might be critically modified, over all, environmental policies can be more realistic and less controversial under the new administration\u2019s E.P.A. If so, this will be good for the environment and society. Why is that? Environmental policy relies on interest-group politics.  Advocates and opponents provide information to the agency about benefits and costs of proposed programs.  Where interest groups compete, the agency receives balanced appraisals.  When they do not, the agency receives one view. Support for federal environmental policy is strongly associated with income, education, residence and political party \u2014 the same characteristics that statistically explain interest-group effectiveness. Where opponents are unorganized, poorer and lack information on policy proposals, they are less effective in lobbying.  As a result, environmental policies, even when portrayed as providing general public goods, can be favored by a well-organized few, but not by the broader electorate. Moreover the E.P.A. is unlikely to be a disinterested party. Staff identify with expanding their mission and the agency benefits from greater regulatory mandates that increase budgets and staffing.   Mixed political support is compounded by the way environmental policy works.  It primarily uses a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d rule, whereby parties who inflict environmental harm are fined or required to make costly production or consumption adjustments.  While there is a logic for this, the result is that those parties bear the costs of providing a public good. If these costs are high enough and the policies are not as broadly valued as they are by advocates, then environmental regulations are seen as being inequitable and economically damaging to certain constituents.  These parties are motivated to organize, and political push back occurs.  The E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan, for example, imposes direct costs on fossil-fuel producing regions \u2014 their communities, workers and mineral rights owners.  Lower-income consumers nationwide, as well as employees and firm/property owners in energy-intensive industrial areas are harmed.  These groups disproportionately bear the costs of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  A similar skewed distribution of benefits and costs applies to Clean Water Act extensions, where Midwestern farmers will have to pay fees or secure permits to cultivate near peripheral water, depending on \u201cstream\u201d definition under E.P.A. rules.  Again, overall benefits come at a cost to these parties.    It seems clear why both vague general benefits and policy costs and their unequal distributions have made the E.P.A. a flashpoint for many.  Political reaction undermines policy objectives. We have seen this in the response to free trade policies that are nationally beneficial, but inflict harm on certain groups and regions.  If the new E.P.A. changes this distributional dynamic through adoption of \u201cbeneficiary pays\u201d rules and other compensation to those who bear direct costs, the country may achieve more balanced environmental regulation.   \u201cBeneficiary pays\u201d shifts the cost burden to those who value the environmental policy more and hence, leads to a more proportionate distribution of benefits and costs.  Research has shown that these distributions are far more successful in eliciting the support of those who must take action to provide the environmental good.  And when advocates or advocate organizations have to pay, they more carefully weigh benefits and costs in setting objectives, then when the costs are off loaded to others.  Under those circumstances, we are more apt to get the \u201cright\u201d amount of environmental goods through regulation. We have experience with such compensation schemes and positive responses on a small-scale basis in payments to irrigators to fallow land or to line ditches, releasing the water for environmental instream flows. Similar incentive payments are used to pay fishers to reduce fishing to protect fish stocks. These schemes primarily have been used by nongovernmental organizations, such as Environmental Defense, Freshwater Trust and The Nature Conservancy. The new E.P.A. might learn from these experiences and adopt them more generally in devising and implementing policies that are more politically robust and successful in achieving long-term environmental goals.  Will Trump and his new E.P.A. chief have public support if they try to dismantle environmental protections?"}
{"Headline": "A Bigger Economic Pie, but a Smaller Slice for Half of the U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byEven with all the setbacks from recessions, burst bubbles and vanishing industries, the United States has still pumped out breathtaking riches over the last three and half decades.The real economy more than doubled in size; the government now uses a substantial share of that bounty to hand over as much as $5 trillion to help working families, older people, disabled and unemployed people pay for a home, visit a doctor and put their children through school.Yet for half of all Americans, their share of the total economic pie has shrunk significantly, new research has found.This group \u2014 the approximately 117 million adults stuck on the lower half of the income ladder \u2014 \u201chas been completely shut off from economic growth since the 1970s,\u201d the team of economists found. \u201cEven after taxes and transfers, there has been close to zero growth for working-age adults in the bottom 50 percent.\u201dThe new findings, by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, provide the most thoroughgoing analysis to date of how the income kitty \u2014 like paychecks, profit-sharing, fringe benefits and food stamps \u2014 is divided among the American population.Stagnant wages have sliced the share of income collected by the bottom half of the population to 12.5 percent in 2014, from 20 percent of the total in 1980. Where did that money go? Essentially, to the top 1 percent, whose share of the nation\u2019s income nearly doubled to more than 20 percent during that same 34-year period.But now a new administration in Washington is promising to reshape the government\u2019s role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind.During his tenure in the White House, President Obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance.About 30 percent of the country\u2019s income is channeled to federal, state and local taxes. Apart from military spending and performing basic public services, much of that is distributed back to individuals through various programs and tax benefits in the form of Social Security checks, Medicare benefits and veterans\u2019 benefits. But until now, no one has truly measured the full impact that tax payments, government spending, noncash benefits and nontaxable income together have on inequality.Abundant documentation of income inequality already exists, but it has been challenged as incomplete. Studies have excluded the impact of taxes and value of public benefits, skeptics complained, or failed to account for the smaller size of households over time.This latest project tries to address those earlier criticisms. What the trio of economists found is that the spectacular growth in incomes at the peak has so outpaced the small increase at the bottom from public programs intended to ameliorate poverty and inequality that the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else has continued to widen.Average incomes, adjusted for inflation, grew by 61 percent from 1980 to 2014. But nearly $7 out of every additional $10 went to those in the top tenth of the income scale.Inequality has soared over that period. In 1980, the researchers found, someone in the top 1 percent earned on average the equivalent of $428,200 a year in 2014 dollars \u2014 about 27 times more than the typical person in the bottom half, whose annual income equaled $16,000.By 2014, the average income of half of American adults had barely budged, remaining around $16,000, while members of the top 1 percent brought home, on average, $1,304,800 or 81 times as much.That ratio, the authors point out, \u201cis similar to the gap between the average income in the United States and the average income in the world\u2019s poorest countries, the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Burundi.\u201dTax credits and programs like Medicare and disability payments have helped families at the lower half of the income scale. But they have just nipped at the heels of the underlying trend.\u201cIt confirms the surge in income at the top,\u201d said Raj Chetty, an economist at Stanford unaffiliated with the project, who called the work \u201cterrific and very important. And it shows government redistribution doesn\u2019t really change the picture.\u201dLawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard who also independently reviewed the research, agreed that the data underscored the inadequacies of programs that try to redress inequities after the fact. \u201cIt suggests that if you don\u2019t do something earlier in the market, before distribution, through better education or greater bargaining power, it\u2019s really tough to offset completely,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cCountries with less inequality do some of both.\u201dIf there is a bright spot in the new comprehensive research, it is that after taxes and government spending, the middle class is in better shape than previous studies had shown. That earlier research had missed growth in nontaxable income like employee benefits. \u201cThe real income of the middle class is a bit better than we thought,\u201d Mr. Katz said.\u201cInequality is a symptom of a variety of things,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. Technological progress may be a cause, but it benefits society over all, whereas the weakness of the educational system is clearly negative.Instead, Mr. Conard said, entrepreneurs in the United States have been willing to take big risks that have helped foster an infrastructure that promotes innovation, not just in Silicon Valley but in many other growing places around the country. \u201cWhen rewards go up, people are more inclined to take risks,\u201d he said. Some of those risks pay off and create wealth for everyone.The new research challenges that contention, at least in part.Mr. Piketty, Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman concluded that the main driver of wealth in recent years has been investment income at the top. That is a switch from the 1980s and 1990s, when gains in income were primarily generated by working.That divergence can slow innovation and further entrench inequities, said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. When labor income provides the primary route to riches, it creates incentives for people to improve their education and work harder, Ms. Boushey explained. But if getting ahead requires already having a stockpile of cash or inheriting a windfall from your parents, then it is much harder to work your way up.\u201cIf you\u2019re closing off entryways, then you are basically shutting off avenues to competitiveness, innovation and growth,\u201d Ms. Boushey said, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t care about fairness.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the author of \u201cThe Upside of Inequality\u201d on second reference. As correctly noted on first reference, he is Edward Conard, not Conrad.An earlier version of a chart with this article showing the sources of income for the top 1 percent reversed the labels for labor and capital.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Donald Trump Pushes on Taiwan, How China Could Push Back", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has made it clear that he views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing \u2014 known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy \u2014 as ripe for review.In trying to use Taiwan that way, Mr. Trump hit the most sensitive of what the Chinese Communist Party calls its \u201ccore interests.\u201d If Washington formally recognizes Taiwan, the Chinese are expected to break off diplomatic relations.Though the United States officially ended relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains an unofficial embassy there called the American Institute in Taiwan. It has also sold Taiwan advanced military equipment and has worked to promote its democracy.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that American support for Taiwan was negotiable. \u201cTaiwan is not a source of leverage,\u201d Mr. Earnest said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a close partner of the United States.\u201dThe Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, put the matter more bluntly, saying Mr. Trump was \u201clike a child in his ignorance of foreign policy.\u201d It added: \u201cThe One China policy cannot be bought and sold. Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price.\u201dHere are five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration:In 2016, Boeing is expected to complete plane deliveries to China worth $11 billion, mostly 737s that have become the workhorse of China\u2019s rapidly expanding airlines. The Global Times warned that it would be easy for China to switch orders to Boeing\u2019s European competitor, Airbus.\u201cOn economic issues, China has more and more leverage,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, the director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. \u201cIf we feel he is still pushing the Taiwan issue, we will take action. If he wants to keep it up on Taiwan, it will only backfire.\u201dAmerican trade officials worry that China could intensify its discrimination against American technology firms by using the country\u2019s antimonopoly laws. Last year, the Chinese government slapped a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, a San Diego-based chip maker, for what it said were licensing infractions.A few years ago, there were worries that China might suddenly dump a large portion of its holdings of Treasuries, pushing up interest rates in the United States. Those fears ebbed as China pared its holdings gradually. Its holdings of Treasuries peaked at $1.65 trillion in March 2014, declining to about $1.3 trillion, said Brad Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations.Experts say that even if the country sold more, it may not have much effect because interest rates are already low, global demand for Treasuries has been strong, and the Federal Reserve could buy more bonds if needed to offset action by China.China could also weaken its currency, something Mr. Trump has argued it already does to make its products cheaper. But that could also result in more Chinese taking their money out of the country, as well as inflation for a nation that increasingly buys what it needs from abroad, like oil, because a weak currency means China must pay more for imported goods.Mr. Trump said on Sunday, \u201cAnd frankly, they\u2019re not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201dChina could switch from being a reluctant ally of North Korea to a friendly neighbor. China is already angry at Washington for the recent decision to deploy a defense shield in South Korea, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, which China argues is aimed at limiting its military capabilities.Among the tools China could use would be improved trade, aid and investment to strengthen the North\u2019s rudimentary economy, said John Delury, an American analyst in Seoul, South Korea. As a longstanding ally, China could conduct joint military exercises with the North, he said.In return for promises by North Korea not to proliferate, Mr. Delury said, China could go beyond improved trade, and provide substantial economic backing in a Marshall Plan-style initiative.President Obama spent much of his political capital with China ensuring that Beijing would agree to the international climate change agreement that committed the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters to lower greenhouse gases.Critics of Mr. Obama say he failed to force China to open up its markets, stood by while China fortified islands in the South China Sea and remained largely silent while Mr. Xi carried out repressive human rights policies in order to save the climate change accord.It was relatively easy for Mr. Xi to agree to a reduction in emissions given the outcry among the Chinese public about air pollution and contaminated food. The accord calls for China\u2019s carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline \u201caround 2030\u201d but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States.Mr. Xi would be unlikely to touch the climate accord because of the popularity of the prospect of cleaner air among the Chinese public.If Mr. Trump supports Taiwan, China\u2019s first response may be to punish Taiwan rather than the United States, in an attempt to diminish its value to Washington.It could begin by intensifying efforts to persuade the 22 small sovereignties around the world, including the Vatican, that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to sever them and recognize China instead.China might then take aim at Taiwan\u2019s economy by restricting Chinese investments and limiting the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.Taiwan already has de facto independence, but China has warned that it will go to war to prevent it a formal separation from the mainland.From Beijing\u2019s perspective, the fear is that Mr. Trump\u2019s moves could encourage Taiwan to declare independence or that other nations might follow the United States in recognizing Taiwan.If President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan declared independence, \u201cand the whole world says Taiwan is independent,\u201d then China \u201cwill take military action,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that is Tsai\u2019s intention,\u201d he added.China was a signatory to the nuclear accord reached with Iran in 2015 that lifted sanctions in return for Iran\u2019s getting rid of 98 percent of its nuclear material. China now has unfettered access to its longtime friend\u2019s economy. Through Iran, Beijing will seek to enhance its influence in the Middle East, with the goal of weakening American prestige in the region.But if the deal is scrapped and renegotiated, as Mr. Trump has called for, China would keep trading with Iran, isolating the United States, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow for energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.About one-third of Iran\u2019s oil exports go to China, and China is Iran\u2019s top importer of goods. Thus China is Iran\u2019s top trading partner, a position that would not change in the event of Mr. Trump\u2019s renouncing Washington\u2019s participation in the nuclear deal.\u201cIf anything, China would redouble trading and investment in Iran now that Trump has started on the Taiwan front,\u201d Mr. Chow said.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from New York, and Gardiner Harris from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland Fire Leads to Crackdown on Illegal Warehouses Nationwide", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byCities are calling on neighbors to report buildings they suspect might be giving parties like the one that took place the night of the fire at an Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, while concert promoters report a broad crackdown on illegal spaces around the country.\u201cI knew there would be this wave, but it happened a lot faster than I thought,\u201d said Forest Juziuk, a Detroit-based booker for electronic musicians like those who played at the warehouse where the fire occurred. \u201cBy Tuesday night I started seeing text messages from around the U.S. about fire marshals coming through and eviction notices being served.\u201dOver the past few decades, many of America\u2019s once-gritty cities have seen a profound revitalization in which decaying industrial buildings have been turned into residences, artists\u2019 lofts and gallery spaces. These buildings often serve as sources of affordable housing and profit, while providing walls and stages for an underground circuit of artists and musicians.\u201cYou have spaces that are not being used in a particular area, and urban entrepreneurship fills the space,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities. \u201cIt\u2019s something we love about cities, but it\u2019s a constant battle between urban creativity and the attempt of regulators to impose controls on it.\u201dThe warehouses in Oakland are similar to ones nationwide that struggle with this dynamic. Residents of several illegally occupied warehouses, some who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of eviction, reported landlord visits, insurance inspections and 60-day eviction notices being handed out to friends in the past few days.\u201cThey deemed our place unsafe and that it was not up to code,\u201d he said.Roman Clark, a spokesman for the Baltimore Fire Department, said a complaint on Monday had prompted the investigation. Both the Fire and Housing Departments investigated the building and found numerous safety and housing violations.\u201cThe Housing Department condemned the building and boarded it up,\u201d Mr. Clark said.No city officials are going to say they approve of illegal parties held in decrepit warehouses, but some acknowledge privately that underground spaces are part of how cities work and are likely to remain so.In the aftermath of the Oakland fire, Mayor James Kenney of Philadelphia and the commissioner of the Department of Licenses and Inspections sent out a joint news release calling on warehouse owners and managers to make sure their spaces are safe.The city\u2019s Office of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy said in a statement that it \u201cunderstands that artists are resourceful in identifying spaces that meet their distinct, creative needs,\u201d adding, \u201cour priority remains their and the public\u2019s safety.\u201d\u201cWe are concerned about exactly what happened in Oakland,\u201d said Karen Guss, a spokeswoman for the Licenses and Inspections Department, but \u201cthere is no way this city or any city of size is going to be able to address these issues on their own.\u201dNew York also has a long history of transforming buildings and warehouses into arts and music spaces. But gentrification of the areas most fertile to the enterprise \u2014 like Bushwick, an industrial pocket of Brooklyn \u2014 means that semipermanent spaces similar to the Ghost Ship have become rarer.In interviews, warehouse dwellers from around the country said they were well aware that their living choices posed a risk. And yet they stay, because the rent is cheap and because there are not many legitimate housing options where they can play drums, fix motorcycles or use a blowtorch, 20 feet from their beds.\u201cPeople will always seek what spaces like Ghost Ship offer,\u201d Aaron Muszalski, an artist who has spent the past two decades living and working in warehouses across the Bay Area. \u201cWhat we need are solutions that don\u2019t seek to eradicate these spaces, but which allow them to come safely into the light and support them economically in becoming safer and more accountable \u2014 something that is impossible so long as we pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u201dFor now, however, Oakland artists are hunkering down. Fearing eviction, they have tried to impose a sort of collective media blackout by encouraging anyone talking about the fire to make their social media posts private or to refrain from posting entirely.\u201cPlease don\u2019t name or draw attention to other artist housing in our community,\u201d read a post on one private forum. \u201cThe last thing we need is more members of our community thrown out on the streets.\u201dOthers are trying to mitigate the safety risks, but, true to form, they are organizing their efforts in the same manner as they might an underground techno show: in private, with discretion and the hope that it can all be handled in-house.In private Facebook groups and at an impromptu town hall meeting of warehouse dwellers that was held Wednesday night in Berkeley, Calif., residents exchanged advice with neighbors on how to arrange discreet inspections or buy fire extinguishers.\u201cThis is for all of us who understand that the fire in Oakland was not an unlikely accident, but rather an inevitability given the dangerous precarity of the spaces in which underground D.I.Y. culture exists nationally,\u201d Ms. Frost wrote in a post introducing the site. \u201cThis is for everyone waiting to see these communities flourish and wanting to see to it that this does not happen again.\u201dSarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "In Cuban Town That Hershey Built, Memories Both Bitter and Sweet", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byCamilo Cienfuegos JournalCAMILO CIENFUEGOS, Cuba \u2014 The sugar refinery has been closed for 14 years, yet Amarylis Ribot still misses the whoop of the steam whistle that signaled the changes in work shifts.She misses the smell of the harvest \u2014 \u201can odor difficult to explain,\u201d she said \u2014 and the sweetness hanging in the air. She misses the sound of industry, like the clack of the trains bringing in raw cane and hauling away sacks of sugar, but mostly at night, after she turns off the television.\u201cIt\u2019s a big mix of emotions,\u201d Ms. Ribot, 68, said. \u201cIndustry is no longer, so nostalgia takes its place.\u201dHe named the place Hershey.The village would come to include about 160 homes \u2014 the most elegant made of stone, the more modest of wooden planks \u2014 built along a grid of streets and each with tidy yards and front porches in the style common in the growing suburbs of the United States. It also had a public school, a medical clinic, shops, a movie theater, a golf course, social clubs and a baseball stadium where a Hershey-sponsored team played its home games, residents said.The factory became one of the most productive sugar refineries in the country, if not in all of Latin America, and the village was the envy of surrounding towns, which lacked the standard of living that Mr. Hershey bestowed on his namesake settlement.The company owned all the properties in the village but was a benevolent patron, residents said. It paid relatively high salaries, subsidized the housing and sought to keep its employees and their families happy, responding quickly to home repair issues and maintaining public utilities.\u201cThis was a place separate from the rest of the country,\u201d said Pedro Gonzalez Bernal, 67, a lifelong resident of the village and a radio journalist, whose father worked as a conductor on the rail line Mr. Hershey built to connect the refinery with Havana and the port of Matanzas. \u201cWe were a little world apart.\u201dBut the company\u2019s imported mores also included class and racial segregation: The American supervisors lived in the biggest houses, the laborers in the smallest; black workers were assigned homes on the farthest edge of town.Mr. Hershey died in 1945 and the company sold the plant and village, along with his other Cuban holdings, in 1948.After Mr. Castro\u2019s ascent in 1959, the refinery was nationalized and the town was renamed Camilo Cienfuegos, after one of Mr. Castro\u2019s commanders. Segregation ended, current residents say proudly, and the homes were redistributed as Mr. Castro\u2019s socialism sought to flatten class and racial hierarchies.But with the shift in ownership, attention to detail in town gradually began to slip, residents say. Residents became responsible for repairs to their homes, and lower state wages meant that the cost of those repairs was often out of reach. An annual party was eventually discontinued. The baseball stadium was demolished.Still, the sugar refinery remained among the most productive in the country, helping make Cuba the world\u2019s biggest sugar exporter and sugar the backbone of the economy. But the Cuban sugar business declined after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its principal sponsor, and in the early 2000s the government shut scores of sugar plants, including the one here.But unlike similar shutdowns in certain American industrial towns, the closing of the refinery here did not kill the local economy, residents said. The Cuban government helped the workers find new jobs. Some were sent back to school to prepare for work in different industries, while others were placed in growing sectors like tourism.\u201cThey weren\u2019t left without work, obviously,\u201d said Mercedes D\u00edaz Hernandez, 69, Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s wife, as if to suggest that the notion of unemployment in Cuba was an absurdity.Villagers and factory employees responded to the government\u2019s decision with obedience and loyalty. There were no public protests or insurrections, residents said.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview at his home in Camilo Cienfuegos last week.If the factory is stuck in a pattern of economic inefficiency, he continued, \u201cit\u2019s necessary to shut it down for the well-being of the country and the well-being of the revolution.\u201d His television was tuned to a broadcast tracking Mr. Castro\u2019s funeral cort\u00e8ge as it rolled across the country.\u201cThe refinery was always a source of pride,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cWe keep feeling pride.\u201dBut many in the village have quietly wrestled with a feeling of loss.The plant had been \u201cthe center of life here,\u201d said Ms. Ribot, whose father was the director of the Hershey refinery for several years beginning in the late 1960s.Jes\u00fas Zenon Aresbello, 80, who has lived his entire life in the village, said that \u201ceveryone wanted to leave it to their children, to their grandchildren.\u201dThe town\u2019s slide accelerated after the plant closed, residents said. And though the place is still unlike any other in Cuba, it has fallen into a state of general raggedness, not unlike the rest of the country.The condition of many houses shows owners doing their best on few resources: clean, tidy interiors and yards, but the structures held together through a patchwork of repair jobs done on the cheap.Weeds have reclaimed sidewalks, while mounds of trash dot the roadside. Faded revolutionary slogans painted on walls seem undercut against the backdrop of a warehouse\u2019s broken windows or a nearby home\u2019s collapsed roof.In recent months, most of the sugar factory\u2019s buildings were demolished and the debris carted away, leaving a vast and mostly empty wasteland strewn with rubble and twisted metal, and punctuated by three vestigial smokestacks.\u201cI\u2019m a Fidelista, entirely in favor of the revolution,\u201d declared Meraldo Nojas Sutil, 78, who moved to Hershey when he was 11 and worked in the plant during the 1960s and \u201970s. \u201cBut slowly the town is deteriorating.\u201dMany residents do not hesitate to draw a contrast between the current state of the town and the way that it looked when \u201cMr. Hershey,\u201d as he is invariably called here, was the boss.Residents seem amused by, if not proud of, the ties to the United States.Most still use the village\u2019s original name, pronounced locally as \u201cAIR-see.\u201d And Hershey signs still hang at the town\u2019s train station, a romantic nod to a bygone era, though perhaps also a symbol of hope that the past \u2014 at least, certain aspects of it \u2014 will again become the present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iceland Recovers, and Reykjavik Becomes a Hive of Development", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetREYKJAVIK, Iceland \u2014 Set against a vista of sea and mountains, the city\u2019s modern concert hall and convention center, with its kaleidoscopic facade of multicolored glass, averages more than 140,000 visitors each month.The thriving complex, which hosts fans of Bj\u00f6rk and enthusiasts of yo-yoing, is a symbol of how the country has recovered from the economic crisis, aided by tourists, whose appreciation for Iceland and whose influx of cash are further helping to spur development.Outside the center, construction vehicles hum, working on a project that will join the event space downtown with the heart of this capital city\u2019s center, where restaurants and shopping abound. It is one of several projects in a nearly 680,000-square-foot mixed-use development known as the Harpa plot, or Austurhofn, meaning East Harbor. This vast area has been decades in the making and is an attempt to transform the neighborhood into a live-work-play area.\u201cThis has been a big black hole since 2008,\u201d said the Icelandic architect Asgeir Asgeirsson. \u201cBut now we are helping bring new life to downtown.\u201dMr. Asgeirsson, with his architectural firm T.ark, is now helping to better link Harpa with Reykjavik\u2019s historic downtown, less than half a mile southeast, where places like Caf\u00e9 Loki draw visitors for Icelandic delicacies, including dried fish and sheep\u2019s head jelly. Long lines form at the city\u2019s many hot dog stands, which sell the beloved lamb-based Icelandic dog topped with sauces and fried onions. Clothing stores sell a range of gear to handle the island\u2019s quick-changing weather, like traditional Nordic sweaters made from local wool.The new project, which T.ark and Mr. Asgeirsson are helping design, will include more than 355,000 square feet of retail and apartments, and a hotel. The upscale Edition hotel is owned and developed by the Boston-based Carpenter & Company, with the design partner Ian Schrager, and will be managed by Marriott.Riding on Iceland\u2019s recovery, the development of the rest of East Harbor is finally moving ahead. The turnaround is a relief for the country, whose three major banks went under in quick succession and whose currency, the krona, tumbled in the global downturn. Shortly after, the government issued capital controls to prevent money from leaving Iceland and further devaluation of the krona.Reykjavik draws tourists, said the mayor, Dagur B. Eggertsson, because of its \u201cpeople, culture, free-spirited atmosphere and for being one of the safest cities in the world.\u201dCommercial real estate construction has raced to keep up with demand. The number of hotel and guesthouse rooms in Iceland increased 42 percent between 2010 and 2015, according to Statistics Iceland. But that has not been enough to accommodate the crowds. Many locals have leapt into the tourism business to fill the gap. Between December 2014 and November 2015, the number of Airbnb accommodations in Reykjavik jumped 126 percent, according to a report from Islandsbanki Research.Icelandic pension funds have recently played a role in stoking commercial real estate. Unable to invest abroad since 2008 because of the capital controls, pension plans are now the largest investors in Iceland, and they are among the biggest shareholders in the commercial real estate companies that are listed on the stock exchange.But the changes may also help attract new money from outside, Mr. Eggertsson said, adding that \u201cReykjavik is interested in direct foreign investment in hotels and tourism.\u201dThe planned Edition hotel has a budget of $125 million and will offer 250 rooms when it opens in 2018. The hotel, which will have six floors and a rooftop bar, will tailor its food and drinks to draw both Icelanders and visitors, said Kevin Montano, senior vice president for global development at Marriott. \u201cWe want our guests to experience the city like a local,\u201d he said. The hotel will harness Iceland\u2019s abundant geothermal energy to warm the radiant wood floors, and the restaurant\u2019s menu will focus on the country\u2019s specialties of fish and lamb.The developer Richard Friedman, of Carpenter & Company, says he fell in love with the unspoiled Reykjavik, which he sees as a great place for business meetings between Europeans and Americans. \u201cWe want to create a hotel that is simple in an Icelandic way,\u201d he said.The adjacent retail space, as well as 100 apartments, will also aim to blend in with the surroundings, Mr. Asgeirsson said. These buildings will resemble the brightly colored connected houses of old Reykjavik. \u201cEvery staircase will have a different shape, color and height,\u201d he said.Near the planned hotel, construction crews are already laying foundations for another area that has been named Harbor Square, or Hafnartorg. It will include about 80 apartments, as well as office and retail space, and will cover about 250,000 square feet. The anchor tenant for the retail space on the first floor will be the Swedish clothing retailer H&M.The final major plot in the East Harbor development is owned by Landsbankinn, the state-owned bank that was created in 2008 from the ruins of the failed private bank Landsbanki. It announced plans last year to create a 156,000-square-foot headquarters, consolidating 14 offices around Reykjavik, at a price of about $70 million.The move has displeased some, including Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, a member of Parliament who feels that selecting one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Reykjavik was \u201cirrational.\u201d The banks should \u201crespect that their business is a risky one,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unfortunately the cost of bankruptcy ends usually with taxpayers\u2019 carrying the cost.\u201dRunar Palmason, a representative for Landsbankinn, noted that the new headquarters consolidated operations, saving the company about $6 million a year. The building\u2019s footprint will be 46 percent smaller than those of the separate offices combined.One of the largest challenges for all of the East Harbor projects is that legally they are considered one plot because they share underground parking. That means they have to coordinate development and design plans, making for a \u201cvery complicated ownership structure,\u201d said Oli Orn Eiriksson, the head of economic development for the city. \u201cYou have so many different parties building on the same plot at the same time.\u201dThere is also concern about striking a balance between visitors and locals.\u201cThe downtown has changed dramatically,\u201d said David Mar Sigurdsson, a sales and marketing manager for the Icelandic company TG Verk, which owns the Harbor Square development and has invested $130 million in it. \u201cI feel like a foreigner when I go there. There are so many visitors.\u201dWhile Reykjavik is buzzing with tourism, and construction cranes dot the skyline, it is also feeling the strain of the surge of visitors. The East Harbor developers hope the new offices and apartments will balance out the visitors with locals.The country over all is concerned about the wear and tear from tourists on the natural wonders they visit. And in Reykjavik, the pressure is also felt on infrastructure, said Elsa Yeoman, a city councilor in charge of culture and tourism.\u201cWe have been inviting so many guests that it has become expensive to hold the party. Someone has to pay for that,\u201d she said. Still, \u201cas locals, we have a more colorful city than ever before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israel, a Medical Marijuana Pioneer, Is Eager to Capitalize", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli scientists began their pioneering research to isolate the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana with a 10-pound stash seized by the Tel Aviv police. That effort, in the 1960s, helped propel Israel to the vanguard of research into the plant\u2019s medicinal properties and lay the foundations for a medical marijuana industry.Now the nation\u2019s burgeoning pot business, backed by an unlikely coalition of farmers, lawyers, scientists, entrepreneurs and the country\u2019s ultra-Orthodox health minister, is going mainstream \u2014 and eyeing markets abroad.Marijuana, or cannabis, is still classified as a dangerous drug in Israel and remains illegal for recreational purposes. But the government is also at the forefront of efforts to develop and expand the fast-growing medical marijuana industry and make Israel a major center for it.Recent government efforts to regulate medical marijuana will make it more accessible and available by prescription at pharmacies. The government has also appointed a committee to examine the possibility of Israel becoming one of the few countries to allow exports, although the destination for products remains unclear.\u201cIt is almost unprecedented,\u201d said Tamir Gedo, the chief executive of Breath of Life Pharma, an Israeli company permitted to grow medical cannabis and make and distribute products. \u201cIt seems the government is working faster than the private industry.\u201dThe reforms spearheaded by the Health Ministry, which is led by Yaakov Litzman of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party, open up licensing for an unlimited number of growers, up from eight farms. The list of doctors trained and authorized to prescribe marijuana is to be expanded and research encouraged. The reforms, which were approved by the government in the summer, were formulated in cooperation with the Ministries of Agriculture, Justice, Internal Security and Finance.\u201cI cannot say that I am in favor of cannabis,\u201d Mr. Litzman said at a business conference last month, reflecting concerns that medical marijuana could trickle into the recreational market. But Mr. Litzman said he would even support the idea of export so long as revenues went to the Health Ministry, adding, \u201cThere is a lot of pressure on me.\u201dSome of Israel\u2019s more traditional medical institutions and associations are still averse to joining the party, a wariness that marijuana advocates put down to a lack of knowledge. The police worry about leakage into the recreational black market, and some Israelis are concerned that export, if allowed, would stigmatize the country as one that dealt primarily in arms and drugs.About 25,000 Israelis, in a population of 8.5 million, hold permits to use medical marijuana to ease symptoms of cancer, epilepsy and other diseases, but that number is expected to grow rapidly. So far, medical marijuana has been distributed by the growers through special dispensaries or by home delivery.The Health Ministry\u2019s written protocols on the matter, known as the Green Book, have generated international interest.The ministry has approved dozens of clinical trials, Dr. Dor said, adding, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it right here, the specialists will go abroad with their knowledge, and we have wonderful knowledge here.\u201dRaphael Mechoulam, now a professor of medicinal chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and his colleague Yechiel Gaoni first isolated the main compounds, including the psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 with the marijuana supplied by the Tel Aviv police. When administrators at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where Professor Mechoulam was conducting his research, first called the police with the request, he recalled in an interview, \u201cthey asked if I was trustworthy.\u201dProfessor Mechoulam, 86, has continued his research in his current post, focusing on the compounds in the brain that make the active components of marijuana work. He is also a consultant for the Ministry of Health and collaborates with research groups around the world.\u201cMedicinal cannabis has to follow medical lines of thought and development and modern medical routes\u201d in order to produce proper drugs, he said. Pointing to an international paucity of clinical trials, he said, \u201cIsrael has more than the United States at the moment, which is ridiculous.\u201d In the United States, medical marijuana programs exist in many states but remain illegal under federal law.Professor Mechoulam is also a member of the advisory board of Breath of Life, whose products, according to Mr. Gedo, the chief executive, are made according to pharmaceutical best-practice protocols.\u201cWe are working as a pharmaceutical company, not a cannabis company,\u201d Mr. Gedo said. Breath of Life is participating in a dozen clinical trials, including one based on cannabinoids, the chemical compounds in marijuana, for autism in children with the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.According to Mr. Gedo, several American companies are conducting trials in Israel based on Breath of Life\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredients.Teva Israel, a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., recently announced a distribution and cooperation agreement with Syqe Medical, a Tel Aviv company that developed an inhaler for administering marijuana in precise doses. The dose can be tailored to each patient like a standard medical treatment, which experts say should reduce or eliminate the objections of reluctant physicians.Two international medical marijuana conferences have taken place in Israel this year. At the Cann10 conference in Tel Aviv in September, speakers discussed science, medicine, technology and commerce. Purveyors, some in white lab coats, displayed their wares. A grower called PharmoCann displayed rows of sealed plastic vials containing strains of flowers undergoing testing with names like Blue, Train Wreck and Voodoo Child.\u201cWe hope the market will open up in the world as soon as possible,\u201d Moshe Ihea, Cannabliss\u2019s founder and chief executive, said. \u201cFirst we have to open up the people.\u201d He added that he had discovered the medicinal benefits after he suffered a leg injury during an army exercise.Saul Kaye, a pharmacist and the chief executive of iCan: Israel-Cannabis, a venture fund and technology incubator for start-ups driving the global medical marijuana industry, said this \u201ccould be another incredible economy for Israel.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a national consciousness for cannabis that you cannot ignore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Success Comes Dissension in Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byMILAN \u2014 On a gently curving street lined with furriers and antiquarians sits a yellow building with a tinseled fake Christmas tree in the foyer. But unlike the real estate agents and lawyers working above and below, the employees in the second-floor offices are busy managing online elections, spreading fake news and fomenting a political revolution.\u201cWe are the political force of the future, and we have a competitive advantage on the traditional parties that still struggle to understand,\u201d Davide Casaleggio, the Milan firm\u2019s president, wrote in an email. \u201cWhen they realize that it will be too late.\u201dThe son of Gianroberto Casaleggio, a founder of the Five Star Movement who died in April, the younger Mr. Casaleggio is as studiously behind the scenes as the party\u2019s other founder and leader, the gleefully vulgar comedian Beppe Grillo, is public.But in a rare, albeit electronic, interview, Mr. Casaleggio said his company\u2019s software, platforms and tools had played a key role in Five Star\u2019s changing of Italy. The other parties, he added, were \u201clight-years behind\u201d while \u201cwe are at the crest of the wave.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not of the left or the right,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star party\u2019s potential candidate for prime minister and the deputy leader of the lower house of Parliament, said in his stately Rome office. \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize ourselves in these ideologically motivated parties.\u201dIn the days after Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat in the referendum, party leaders crowed about a coming Five Star government. They have demanded early elections, even as Parliament seems likely this week to approve a new government under Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, using much the same majority that Mr. Renzi had.The Five Star members have reiterated their intention to hold a referendum on abandoning the euro currency and held a meeting in Rome to iron out simmering differences between the party\u2019s orthodox and pragmatic wings.At the same time, many members fretted that the party was drifting away from its founding ethos \u2014 of voting on policies and candidates through direct, online democracy \u2014 and toward a centralization of power by Mr. Grillo, Mr. Casaleggio and Mr. Di Maio.For a while, the party was eclipsed by Mr. Renzi, a reformist. But having tied his fate to the referendum last Sunday on constitutional reform \u2014 and losing badly \u2014 Mr. Renzi resigned. Italy\u2019s electoral law is under court review, so it may take months or longer before Italians can vote for a new prime minister. But Five Star is eager to hold immediate elections, as it is already polling at 30 percent in a multiparty race.Former Five Star members said the firm disciplined members who broke party lines and controlled the online process of selecting the party\u2019s candidates, including a coming vote to choose its nominee for prime minister. Marco Canestrari, a former Casaleggio employee who is writing a book about his time there, said employees regularly ran Italian websites that produced slanted or fake news discrediting Mr. Renzi or other opponents.Critics of the party, from Mr. Renzi to Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s conservative Forza Italia party, to leaders of the liberal left, depict the Five Star Movement as an \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d 2.0, complete with a Politburo-style directorate, pro-Vladimir V. Putin sympathies and a requirement that candidates sign a contract agreeing to pay a fine of 150,000 euros (about $158,000) if they betray the movement\u2019s principles.Italian economists have been vexed by the party\u2019s mostly unexplained, but wildly popular, proposals to cut taxes and increase spending, including a proposal to guarantee struggling Italians what is being called a citizen\u2019s income of 780 euros ($824) a month. But supporters of Italy\u2019s role as a critical European Union member are most threatened by the Five Star Movement\u2019s lack of clarity on staying within the eurozone.During a speech at Rome\u2019s Circus Maximus in 2014, Mr. Grillo announced a collection of signatures to demand a referendum on staying in the eurozone. His blog subsequently called for the printing of non-euro currency to cut the public debt.Alessandro Di Battista, a party leader, who campaigned against Mr. Renzi\u2019s proposed constitutional changes while driving his scooter around the country, has expressed interest in leaving the eurozone, the European Union and NATO. (He later softened his position on NATO.) Moderates in the party\u2019s leadership are noticeably noncommital.Former members say the party is purposefully vague on the issue to keep its anti-establishment bona fides without alienating the more mainstream Italian voters needed to win an election.\u201cIn Five Star parlance, people say, \u2018When you get a PS, it\u2019s never a good thing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pizzarotti said.He received such correspondence, eventually signed by Mr. Grillo, after it was revealed that Mr. Pizzarotti was under investigation for mishandling the appointment of the head of the city\u2019s opera house, an allegation that was later proved groundless. But the party suspended him for not informing it of the investigation, a violation of one of its many purity rules.Mr. Pizzarotti\u2019s offers to explain in person to party leaders went unanswered, he said. He eventually left the party.\u201cThey say transparency, but it\u2019s one thing to say and another to do,\u201d Mr. Pizzarotti said, adding that the party had effectively silenced critics by threatening expulsion. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to know who is making decisions. And so you don\u2019t know who has responsibility.\u201dIn Milan, Matteo Ponzano, who helped build La Cosa, the movement\u2019s popular YouTube channel, in the party\u2019s early days, said he still believed in Five Star\u2019s principles but expressed disappointment in its \u201cbecoming another thing.\u201dHe said the senior Mr. Casaleggio had explained to him in 2014 that La Cosa, which Mr. Ponzano had developed as a place for members of Italy\u2019s Parliament and voters to discuss issues, would become \u201ca general channel that has to get clicks\u201d to generate ad revenue. He was dejected, but nevertheless ran for the European Parliament.As the popular face of some of the movement\u2019s largest rallies, Mr. Ponzano thought he had a good chance in the party\u2019s internal online election to select Parliament candidates, but in the middle of the vote, a message appeared on Mr. Grillo\u2019s blog barring collaborators of Casaleggio Associates, like himself, from running.\u201cDuring the vote!\u201d Mr. Ponzano said.Asked about the accusations of electoral meddling, Mr. Casaleggio said, \u201cYou have been misinformed.\u201dThe infighting is not surprising, given the movement\u2019s origins as a protest party. Some former members are disenchanted precisely because the movement is acting like a more traditional party, capitalizing on opportunities to seize power as it tries to broaden its appeal, among working class Italians who feel removed from the European Union and betrayed by their country\u2019s elites.Writing on his blog on Thursday, Mr. Grillo told his millions of followers that despite all the polemics over Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation, the Five Star Movement would \u201cchoose online the candidate for prime minister, the governing team and the candidates for Parliament.\u201d He concluded that the party would continue to \u201cfollow its road.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Worry About the Italy Vote", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byMilan \u2014 The Italian republic is 70 years old, like the Vegas Strip and Donald J. Trump \u2014 and just as unpredictable.In 1946 the Italians, in a passionate referendum, got rid of the monarchy. In 2016, again after a record turnout \u2014 69 percent \u2014 their children and grandchildren fired Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, 41, and his government, the 63rd in those 70 years. Almost 60 percent of voters rejected the radical changes Mr. Renzi had proposed to the Constitution, which were largely aimed at streamlining the Italian government to make way for deep economic reforms.Italy\u2019s youngest-ever prime minister spoke just after midnight, his wife, Agnese, at his side. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they hated me so much,\u201d he said tearfully.Mr. Renzi burst onto the European stage three years ago, heralded as a new kind of Italian leader. But now his usual Tuscan braggadocio was gone; he seemed, all a sudden, like a grown-up Boy Scout who had done his best, and failed.His mistake? Pledging, so early in the campaign, to resign if the reforms were rejected. Immediately it became a referendum on him. His opponents \u2014 the protest Five Star party, the anti-immigrant Northern League, Silvio Berlusconi and his old cronies on the center right, the \u00fcberpopulist Fratelli d\u2019Italia and the left flank of his own Democratic Party \u2014 all loved the drama of it. And so did the public: one against the rest! But politics is not an action movie. In real life the one generally loses. And he lost. Big time.Here and abroad, columnists are dashing off dark warnings about the impending collapse of the euro, and maybe the European Union. After Brexit, Rexit! crow his opponents.Moreover, in Britain, broadly speaking, older voters chose to leave the European Union, while the young voted to stay. In Italy, it\u2019s the other way around. The young turned their backs on Mr. Renzi. It was not, as in Britain, a nostalgic vote; young Italians don\u2019t want to return to a past they\u2019ve never had.They are angry about enormous youth unemployment. They hate begging for poorly paid temporary jobs \u2014 with an average monthly salary of 1,200 euros, or $1,300 \u2014 not enough to let them plan for the future. It\u2019s no coincidence that affluent Milan is among the few large cities that voted \u201cyes\u201d (so did Bologna and Florence, Mr. Renzi\u2019s hometown). All the others \u2014 from Rome to Turin, from Naples to Palermo, from Genoa to Bari \u2014 voted \u201cno.\u201d For all his talk about moving Italy into gear, Mr. Renzi forgot the key Clintonian lesson: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d If the referendum had a larger meaning, it was a vote on Mr. Renzi\u2019s place in Italian politics, not on Italy\u2019s place in Europe.Will the next government fix all this? Most unlikely. Youth unemployment and the chronically bad economic conditions of Southern Italy \u2014 which voted overwhelmingly against Mr. Renzi \u2014 need stronger leadership. The next government, most likely a caretaker until the next elections, will not provide that.And who will lead that government? President Sergio Mattarella will appoint someone soon, but what will he or she do? Pass the budget; welcome European dignitaries in March for the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which instituted the European Union in the first place; host the Group of 7 summit in Taormina, Sicily, in June. Who will support such a government? Probably only the ruling Democratic Party and, most likely, Silvio Berlusconi. Both know that, in the event of a snap election, they\u2019d be wiped out by the populists.Is Mr. Renzi\u2019s tearful demise another bump after Mr. Trump, then? Not really. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was unexpected; Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat was entirely predictable. And Italy is not showing signs of post-traumatic stress, like America. The next prime minister will not be Beppe Grillo, the maverick populist (and admirer of Mr. Trump), nor as colorful, nor as lively. After the tumultuous 1,000 days of Mr. Renzi \u2014 who proposed a lot, accomplished a little and left few stones unturned \u2014 Italy wants to be quiet for a while.That\u2019s the problem, though. In restless times, relaxing is not an option. Italy is a G-7 country, as well as a founding member and one of the three remaining pillars of the European Union. Europe is shaking and the world is racing \u2014 though no one knows exactly where to. And if one wishes to help steer, one needs to sit in the front.\u201cBuona fortuna a noi tutti\u201d \u2014 \u201cGood luck to us all,\u201d Mr. Renzi said at the end of his final news conference. But Italy will need a great deal more than luck this time.Beppe Severgnini is a columnist for Corriere della Sera, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

To that end, it sponsored armed groups that would do its bidding in Syria, groups named for Ottoman rulers like the Sultan Murad Brigade and the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror Brigade.In recent months, Mr. Erdogan has lamented that Mosul, a major hub in Ottoman times and now one of Iraq\u2019s most important cities, was left outside Turkey\u2019s borders when the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923.But the reality on the ground may not comport with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s visions. There is little reason to believe that he can recreate the prestige and the expanse of the Ottoman Empire in a 21st-century world.It was a success \u2014 of sorts. Turkey and its proxies gained control of an area that they used to create a buffer zone between two Syrian Kurdish-administered territories. Iran and Russia, too, were happy to see the American-backed group\u2019s ambitions checked. If Syria\u2019s Kurds were to achieve independence with American assistance, Moscow and Tehran feared, they could be counted on to remain an American ally and perhaps even to host American military bases, threatening Iranian and Russian interests. Accordingly, by using Turkey to beat the Syrian Kurds, Moscow and Tehran hope to drive them away from the United States and into their own arms.Turkey\u2019s rapprochement with Russia goes beyond Syria. Lately, Mr. Erdogan has been openly toying with the idea of joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a pact led by Russia and China that is meant to rival the European Union. In doing so, Turkey is turning away from potential partners in the West that still \u2014 at least for now \u2014 value democracy and human rights, and toward another world of autocrats, pseudo-monarchs and aspiring czars.Alexander Dugin, one of the Kremlin\u2019s chief ideologues and a key proponent of \u201cEurasianism,\u201d has been meeting with A.K.P. officials. This is not a total surprise given the parallels between Russia and Turkey, with their ambivalence toward the West. Mr. Dugin hopes his country will lead an emerging anti-Western \u201cEurasian\u201d alliance; Mr. Erdogan believes it is Turkey\u2019s historical destiny to champion a Muslim world bullied by the West.Yet the current Turkish-Russian cooperation is fragile. Turkey is still one of the biggest patrons of the Syrian rebels, while Russia is Mr. Assad\u2019s staunchest backer. Moreover, Turkey is still a member of NATO, and remains intertwined with the European Union, albeit more for economic than for political reasons.Just as Turkey can never reprise its Ottoman-era role in the Middle East, so too it cannot afford to align itself exclusively with authoritarian regimes and strongmen. Turkey sends around half its exports to the European Union, and its economy is kept afloat by European investment. Joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization would be paltry compensation for what it would give up by spurning Europe.Even the deputy prime minister for economic affairs recently admitted that Turkey is going through \u201cits toughest period since the end of the First World War,\u201d when the Ottoman Empire collapsed. The Turkish people cannot be lulled to sleep forever with fictions of an Ottoman revival. Soon, they will have to wake up and face the unpleasant reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey and Iran\u2019s Dangerous Collision Course", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorToday\u2019s competition between Turkey and Iran is the latest iteration of an old power game: a struggle their progenitors, the Byzantine and Persian empires, started over the control of Mesopotamia \u2014 today\u2019s Iraq and Syria. While the rivalry outlived their transformation from empires to nation-states, they have managed to keep the peace between themselves for nearly 200 years.Yet Turkey and Iran are now on a collision course, mostly because of their involvement as the region\u2019s major Sunni and Shiite powers in the deepening sectarian conflicts in Iraq and Syria. Their inability to accommodate each other has the potential to undermine or even undo the strong ties they have developed over the past two decades, as their economies became increasingly intertwined.How the two countries choose to deploy their power and whether they can overcome their differences are vitally important to determining the future of the Middle East. Left unchecked, the present dynamics point toward greater bloodshed, growing instability and greater risks of direct \u2014 even if inadvertent \u2014 military confrontation.Turkey\u2019s military involvement in Syria and Iraq is partly a response to the perception that Iran is increasingly encroaching on its historic sphere of influence, especially in and around the Aleppo and Mosul battlefields close to its southern border. It is also an effort to prevent the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D., which is affiliated with Turkey\u2019s archnemesis the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., to gain more territory.Friction between the two countries and their proxies is rising alarmingly at a time that mutual trust has reached a nadir.Tehran interprets Turkey\u2019s Syria policy as primarily a product of a neo-Ottoman ambition to regain clout and empower pro-Turkey Sunnis in territories ruled by its progenitor. \u201cWhat changed in Syria\u201d after the civil war began \u201cwas neither the government\u2019s nature nor Iran\u2019s ties with it, but Turkish ambitions,\u201d an Iranian national security official told me. Moreover, Iran blames Turkey for not stemming the flow of Syria-bound jihadists through Turkish territory and for giving them logistical and financial support.In trading accusations, each decries the other\u2019s refusal to acknowledge its view of reality, while ignoring the fact that each has acted in ways for which it faults the other \u2014 including deploying military forces to wars beyond their borders and supporting militias, both aimed at controlling whatever emerges from the debris of today\u2019s turmoil in Syria and Iraq.Both countries have attempted to build on shared interests \u2014 defeating or at least marginalizing the Islamic State and curbing the rise of Syrian Kurds seeking autonomy \u2014 but deep suspicions about the other\u2019s ambitions to benefit from the chaos have stopped them from reaching an arrangement that could reduce tensions.To this end, they need to establish a channel for continuous high-level negotiations over Iraq and Syria. The pace of such meetings to date has been problematic: periodic senior-level encounters lasting one or two days, followed by relatively long periods of diplomatic vacuum often filled with the escalation of proxy wars and one-upmanship. Mr. Erdogan and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei of Iran should designate personal representatives with the authority to manage the diplomatic channel.Among the countries involved in the ever-worsening proxy wars in Iraq and Syria, no two are more suited to seeking mutual accommodation than Turkey and Iran. As mature states with a long history of peaceful relations, they should not allow themselves to be sucked further into an uncertain future. Only by finding common ground can they contribute to a more stable and secure region. The alternative is even greater disorder and suffering.Ali Vaez is the International Crisis Group\u2019s senior Iran analyst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Need a Miracle on 34th Street", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s Notebook\u201cI dreamed the windows were empty,\u201d Mr. Ferretti said on a recent morning, concern still creasing his brow.He was referring to the circus-themed Christmas window displays he\u2019d been commissioned to create for the Madison Avenue flagship of the Italian luxury shoemaker Tod\u2019s.\u201cAt 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, I was going to run over to the store in my bathrobe,\u201d Mr. Ferretti said. \u201cThen I thought to myself, \u2018Maybe is better if I make a phone call first.\u2019 \u201dHappily, an assistant on the other end of the line assured Mr. Ferretti that the period dummy boards he had designed in the shapes of aerialists, contortionists, lion tamers and other tanbark performers \u2014 but no clowns: \u201cI hate clowns\u201d\u2014 were up and ready, well in advance of the V.I.P. opening and the expected holiday hordes.\u201cBut then, I said to myself, \u2018I hope is enough,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Ferretti, a genial neurotic whose list of collaborators includes Federico Fellini, Franco Zeffirelli, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Tim Burton. \u201cI hope is good. I hope people don\u2019t go to other stores to find the shoes.\u201dData from a surprisingly robust Black Friday weekend suggests that shoppers did in fact go to Tod\u2019s to find the shoes. What is more, they did not do all of their shopping online.True, 44 percent of consumers surveyed across the country said they had taken to the internet for their early Christmas purchases, while 40 percent shopped in stores, according to the National Retail Federation.Yet while brick-and-mortar retailers have come to play more of what Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, calls a \u201csupporting role\u201d in the landscape of peak holiday season, a longing appears to persist for social dimensions of consuming and for something more fulfilling than a series of solitary scroll-and-click transactions on a hand-held device.In that urge to participate in something collective can be found a reassuring counterpoint to a nightmare many retailers have awakened to in recent holiday seasons, one portending their own demise. Despite low unemployment levels, buoyant consumer confidence and, by many measures, a robust economy, analysts increasingly suggest a future is not far off when people will do nearly all their shopping online, visiting brick-and-mortar retailers mainly for comparison pricing and to partake of shopping spectacle.Even at that, a cold bottom-line calculus has diminished the efforts many retailers put into creating entertainment for holiday shoppers. Of the scores of seasonal window displays once gracing the city\u2019s great retailing corridors, only a few sturdy stalwarts remain.To walk Fifth Avenue north from 34th Street to Central Park this season is to discover a startling paucity of merchants making more than a token nod to the holidays in their window displays. Never mind elves or Santa or Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Barely a snowflake is to be found at mass-market retailers like Zara, the North Face, Urban Outfitters, Uniqlo, Fossil, Tommy Bahama, Oakley, Guess, Desigual, Sephora or H&M.This stark absence underscores both a shift in consumer patterns and the precious anachronism of what few holiday windows remain. Extravagant, giddy, gaudy, mechanized, jewel-like, politically pointed or merely kitsch, the windows staged each year by Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Barneys New York, Tiffany & Company and Bloomingdale\u2019s have long been among New York\u2019s treasures.Whether an average consumer would actually be brave enough to cross the threshold of department stores selling stuff like a $3,500 Sylvie bag from Gucci or $800 suede Alexander Wang Tia pumps, any pedestrian can press nose to windowpane. And on peak days, as many as half a million people have been counted making their way past the holiday windows at Saks Fifth Avenue.\u201cIt\u2019s theater without tickets,\u201d Ms. Bellman said.It represented the accumulated window-display lore acquired across the years by the onetime proprietor of Baum\u2019s Bazaar in Aberdeen, S.D. And in some ways as startling as the Oz-like technological innovations Baum advocated in creating \u201cillusion windows\u201d \u2014 incandescent globes, revolving stairs or a bust of a \u201cVanishing Lady\u201d that periodically dropped below a pedestal, only to reappear in 10 minutes wearing a new hat \u2014 is how many similar effects are still in use.17 PhotosBruno Bettelheim, the psychologist, might have had a field day with scenes of Clara battling and \u201cwhipping\u201d an army of marshmallow mice or of a pair of harlequin gingerbread \u201ccrumbs\u201d dancing out from beneath the folds of the parted skirt of Mother Ginger.\u201cLast year, the theme was icy white, and we decided to go in the completely opposite direction,\u201d said Mark Briggs, the creative force behind the windows and an executive vice president at Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, on a recent behind-the-scenes tour of the Saks windows.Reached by way of doors concealed from view on the store\u2019s main sales floor, the windows were, at less than four feet, surprisingly shallow for all their weird allusive depths.It is perhaps not remarkable that psychology plays a role in the creation of holiday windows. As if by unspoken agreement, windows at almost every one of the major department stores this season featured themes of nature both innocent and imperiled.At Lord & Taylor, a sidewalk bower of illuminated greenery acts as an enchanted tunnel. Through it, pedestrians are conducted past five windows portraying bunnies seen from a bird\u2019s-eye vantage as they ice-skate on a forest pond; a mother owl nestling three newly hatched owlets with bobble heads; a bear buried in a snowbank; a gaggle of dancing geese; and a brace of foxes slumbering in an underground den as aboveground raccoons attempt to awaken them.At Bloomingdale\u2019s, a group of visual artists commissioned to create individual chandeliers on the general theme of \u201clight\u201d came up with sculptural fixtures evoking the moon, the stars, a human face in neon and a sprightly octopus with light bulbs at the tips of its tentacles.\u201cThere used to be so much more holiday display around, but now it\u2019s down to the five or so big department stores,\u201d said Jack Hruska, executive vice president for creative services at Bloomingdale\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 25 years, and in my experience, our desire is not to sell merchandise so much as to be part of the New York experience.\u201dNew York being the frenetic city it is, communicating the \u201cNew York experience\u201d \u2014 whatever that may be \u2014 demands of most window designers that they put their holiday message across efficiently enough to be understood on the run. \u201cWe tried some complex things and realized we were asking people to stand too long in the cold,\u201d Mr. Hruska said.Given that sidewalks on Lexington Avenue, where Bloomingdale\u2019s stands, are narrower than those on Fifth, a retail consultant had to be called in to devise a solution for pileups caused when frenzied holiday shoppers barreled into those who paused at the windows to gawp. \u201cHe advised us to put up planters with trees\u201d in order for people to step out of the flow and avoid what the consultant termed \u201cbutt rush,\u201d Mr. Hruska said. \u201cAnd that worked.\u201dButt rush, alas, is hardly the challenge confronting the artists responsible for the gemlike miniature dioramas installed in the windows at Tiffany & Company. Pedestrians attempting to pass through the maze of Jersey barriers (now slipcovered in Tiffany blue) outside the jeweler\u2019s neighbor, Trump Tower, are routinely stopped for bag searches at guarded checkpoints by officials charged with protecting the high-rise home of the president-elect.It is no worry, either, outside Barneys New York on Madison Avenue, where the Love Peace Joy Project brought together artists like Nick Cave, Ebony G. Patterson and Rob Pruitt, the design collective Studio Job, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cSouth Park.\u201d Barneys gave them individual windows in which to riff \u2014 brilliantly in each case \u2014 on qualities that in the current climate seem in short supply.And happily, there is nothing to impede the pedestrian throngs that stand transfixed outside the Fifth Avenue windows of Bergdorf Goodman, where, as it has for decades, the specialty retailer has again installed a series of window displays as creatively unhindered as they are opulent.David Hoey, the senior director for visual presentation \u2014 aided by a roster of over 100 craftspeople drawn from the ranks of the city\u2019s freelancers \u2014 has once again produced a suite of windows that would do L. Frank Baum proud.\u201cThey let the kite out with us creatively,\u201d Mr. Hoey recently said, without exaggeration, of the Dallas-based Neiman Marcus Group, which owns the specialty retailer.No one who experienced them will soon forget the baroque marvels Mr. Hoey and his cohort have conjured over the last two decades, windows filled with such things as Victorian fainting couches, albino peacocks, hundreds of specially commissioned needlepoint portraits of literary figures, scores of ventriloquist dummies, transistor radios, Snoopy figures, vintage toasters and anything and everything material that might, as he said, \u201cspoil your senses.\u201dEven in a screen-obsessed culture, as Linda Fargo, the senior vice president of Bergdorf Goodman recently noted, there are still few delights that can compare with what she termed \u201creal-time eye candy six inches away from you behind a plate of glass.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After a Year of Faulty Predictions, 3 Approaches to Investing", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersThere is one thing analysts can agree on about the year that is coming to a close: 2016 confounded predictions and expectations. From how stocks would perform to who would win the presidency, this was a bad year for people who tell us what tomorrow will bring.So as people take stock of what has passed and wonder about what\u2019s to come, is there anything to latch on to for guidance? Or is rolling dice just as likely to yield a useful forecast?You will not get any predictions here. Instead you\u2019ll get a look at three reasonable approaches \u2014 call them the 3 C\u2019s \u2014 that investors can take to prepare themselves for next year or any year.The argument here is that a company\u2019s fundamental sales and earnings potential can be analyzed. And while individual investors have been cautious about investing money in the stock market over the last several years, company earnings have continued to be strong.\u201cWith so much negativity out there, you still have to put your money somewhere,\u201d said Thorne Perkin, president of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a theme of U.S. pre-eminence, which we\u2019ve had for years. U.S. equity is the place to be.\u201dSome of the company approach has its basis in how stock markets typically perform. About three-quarters of the time, they go up. And consumers keep buying things.Of course, if there is some external shock \u2014 say, a trade war or a foreign policy crisis \u2014 then it could affect how, when and where companies sell things. And this uncertainty is where the company approach can have pitfalls: What is known now is not everything.\u201cConsumer confidence improved further in December, due solely to increasing expectations, which hit a 13-year high,\u201d Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, which tracks consumer confidence, said in a statement.But there was a caveat: \u201cThe postelection surge in optimism for the economy, jobs and income prospects, as well as for stock prices, which reached a 13-year high, was most pronounced among older consumers.\u201dStew Leonard Jr., president and chief executive of the Stew Leonard\u2019s grocery store chain, which operates in affluent areas of Connecticut and New York, has his own way of measuring the economic sentiment of his customers: He calls it the mashed potato index.Mashed potatoes that are prepared in the store cost about $4 a pound, compared with $1 a pound for potatoes. But with plain old potatoes, you have to peel, cook and mash them yourself.Yet the price disparity between the two is so great \u2014 some 400 percent \u2014 that when Mr. Leonard sees customers buying more prepared mashed potatoes, he stocks the shelves with more high-end food. Customers are feeling flush with cash.\u201cThere isn\u2019t even a close parallel as far as cost goes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s timesaving.\u201dThis holiday season, he said, mashed potato sales were up 31 percent from last year. Catering, he said, was also up 15 percent, and sales of bottles of wine above $20 have also increased since the election.\u201cWe\u2019ve got these things in the store that I rely on a little bit,\u201d Mr. Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t bet the ranch on them, but I keep an eye on them. I really do think they\u2019re a precursor of what\u2019s to come.\u201dYet by the time Donald J. Trump begins his presidency, Mr. Leonard said, his leading indicators will be less reliable. \u201cI can\u2019t really read January or February that well,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is on diets.\u201dThere is one option, however \u2014 particularly after such an unpredictable year \u2014 that all investors can embrace. It\u2019s an approach that allows them to manage the only thing that any investor can control: having a saving, spending and investing plan and adhering to it just as surely when stock prices fall in value as when they rise quickly.As we all know, advice to create a financial plan is akin to recommending a diet after a holiday season of gluttony. Most of us know it\u2019s what we need, but sticking to our resolve beyond the first weeks of the year can prove difficult. (After all, Mr. Leonard knows his consumer indicators revert to the mean after the dieting months of January and February are over.)But several advisers have suggestions on how to keep people sticking to their plans. One of them is thinking negatively about the year.\u201cIf I had had a crystal ball, and it said the U.K. would vote to leave the E.U. and that Trump would win the election, it would have never occurred to any of us that the response would have been a really ebullient stock market,\u201d said Seth Masters, chief investment officer of Bernstein, which manages portfolios for AllianceBernstein\u2019s private client group. \u201cSo what you need to do is have some thoughtful risk management and predict all the ways you think you can be wrong.\u201dSounds like a depressing way to begin a new year, but Mr. Masters explains that concentrating on potential risks is one way to get investors to stick to the long-term plans they created.He said the plans that the firm set up for clients before the 2008 crisis had accounted for the risk of a recession like the one the United States went through. The plans did not place a high probability on such a collapse, but they did chart a course through it.\u201cWe spent a lot of time speaking to clients that there could be a lot of bumps in the road, and that the only way a plan could work is if you stuck to it even when things were terrible,\u201d Mr. Masters said.Of course, during the crisis many investors panicked just as assets were at their lowest. \u201cThe industry may have been putting plans together, but the evidence is pretty damning,\u201d Mr. Masters said. \u201cAt every dip, there have been huge outflows into bonds from equities at the exact wrong time, and then money back into stocks at the wrong time.\u201dWhat\u2019s the solution? Instead of panicking, investors should rebalance their portfolios \u2014 meaning that they should adhere to the allocations set out in their plan. This goes for good times, too, when people are more likely to let positive returns knock their portfolios out of balance.\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many people come in, and they create a plan and then they take it home and never touch it again,\u201d said Darrell L. Cronk, president of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cKeeping it alive, changing it, adjusting it as the return structure changes \u2014 we plot a line to make sure people are staying on that plan.\u201d\u201cThere are no epiphanies,\u201d he added. \u201cDiscipline, discipline, discipline is going to get you a lot farther down the path when emotions ride high and you most want to make those decisions\u201d that deviate from the plan.While this sounds a lot more boring than telling people to buy a certain stock or bet the farm on a commodity, focusing energy on a plan is going to get people a lot closer to their goals in 2017 and beyond.Besides, as Mr. Masters said, \u201cNo one will have the right list of surprises for you, and if they did, you\u2019d think they were nuts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Promising Arms Race, Could Set World on Uncertain Path", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterMr. Trump has a history of bluster and his declarations may turn out to be bluffs. But should he follow through on instigating a nuclear arms race, the consequences could be severe. Best estimates of likely Russian and Chinese responses offer a concerning guide. So do lessons from the Cold War arms race, which brought the world so close to the brink that once-hostile American and Soviet adversaries worked to reverse the competition they had once seen as essential.Nuclear arms races are not usually something that states set out to provoke, but are pulled into against their wills.In the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union saw themselves as reacting to one another, straining to maintain a strategic balance that would deter war or at least make it survivable.Winston Churchill remarked in 1954 that more warheads could accomplish little more than to \u201cmake the rubble bounce.\u201dBut this quote reflects a long-held misunderstanding: that the arms race was a simple matter of accruing warheads.In fact, it was far more dangerous, with ever-growing stockpiles merely reflecting complex tit-for-tat advances. For instance, one country might develop weapons that could deliver warheads more rapidly, which would require the other to shorten its response time and build redundant, retaliatory weapons.While \u201carms race\u201d describes the sets of policies that helped make the Cold War so dangerous, arms racing was not in itself policy. Rather, it was a much-lamented \u2014 and much-feared \u2014 byproduct of American and Soviet aims. Leaders on both sides wanted to avoid losing, but none saw the race as desirable.The exception, Ronald Reagan, entered office in 1981 determined to win the Cold War in part by outstripping the Soviet Union on nuclear arms. But after a few years of tightening response times and near-miss incidents, he became the most enthusiastic proponent of nuclear disarmament to occupy the Oval Office.Though some Americans believe the arms race won the Cold War, as Mr. Reagan had initially hoped, the two sides ended their competition willingly \u2014 and a few years before internal political and economic forces would pull down the Soviet Union from within.Mr. Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought total disarmament at a 1986 summit meeting. Unable to agree on terms, they settled for an ongoing drawdown of nuclear forces, reversing the arms race.Such reductions have continued since, codified in treaties such as the 2010 New Start agreement, which Mr. Trump\u2019s policy would likely undo.In his Twitter post on Thursday announcing that policy, Mr. Trump said his goal was that \u201cthe world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201dIt is not clear what that means. But whatever his intention, analysts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire to provoke an arms race does have a foreseeable range of outcomes.The two countries most likely to respond are Russia, whose nuclear arsenal is comparable to that of the United States, and China, which has a far smaller program.Though each has a slightly different goal, both design their programs to counterbalance the United States, and will therefore calibrate to keep pace with any American advances.But analysts warn that, in part because the United States is already so much more powerful in conventional terms, Russia and China may feel forced to take actions that are destabilizing and put all parties at risk.Since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has seen nuclear parity with the United States as its last \u2014 perhaps only \u2014 guarantee of survival against a far stronger Western alliance it perceives as an existential threat. Falling behind would, in Moscow\u2019s view, invite Russia\u2019s destruction.Though Russia\u2019s economy is a fraction the size of America\u2019s, it has kept up. Should it find parity too costly, Moscow would likely compensate by expending another kind of currency: its willingness to accept nuclear risk.This would be aimed at strengthening Russian deterrence against any American threat. For instance, Russia might deploy more nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave located between Poland and Lithuania. Such missiles can reach European capitals in a matter of minutes and, because they are fired from special vehicles, can be difficult to knock out.Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, could also loosen restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons. Some analysts already believe that Russian military doctrine allows for the use of a single \u201cde-escalatory\u201d nuclear strike, in case of a conventional war, to force the other side to stand down. Such policies put a greater onus on the United States to reduce risk, compensating for any relative Russian weakness.Beijing\u2019s nuclear aims are less ambitious: to retain just enough ability that, should the United States attack first, it can fire a few nuclear weapons in retaliation.Should Mr. Trump advance American nuclear abilities \u2014 even if this is aimed principally at Russia \u2014 China will fear that an American first strike could wipe out its warheads. This would render China\u2019s nuclear deterrent effectively obsolete, all but forcing it to compensate.Vipin Narang, a nuclear weapons expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said China would build up its own abilities, but worried that it would seek a quicker fix as well.China might preload nuclear warheads onto missiles to shorten its response time, Mr. Narang suggested. Or it could hide missiles in hardened locations, like tunnels. It might consider adopting Pakistan\u2019s practice of putting warheads in unmarked vans and driving them around the country, in a never-ending road trip, to keep them safe from attack.China could also decide to abandon its policy against the first use of nuclear weapons in any conflict \u201cbecause they could not afford to go second,\u201d Mr. Narang said.Mr. Narang emphasized that such steps would increase the risk of an accident or miscalculation that, while remote, could be catastrophic.Of Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions and their likely impact in Beijing and Moscow, Mr. Narang said, \u201cIt\u2019s a scary new world if he\u2019s serious about, and trying to trigger, an arms race with either or both.\u201dPaul C. Warnke, a senior Pentagon official in the Cold War\u2019s early years, concluded that their mutual buildups were less like a race than two runners on adjacent treadmills. \u201cThe only victory the arms race has to offer,\u201d he wrote in 1975, was to \u201cbe first off the treadmill.\u201dMr. Warnke\u2019s view was controversial at the time, but later became accepted even by many dedicated Cold Warriors. The early 1980s had seen near misses that had brought the world intolerably close to the edge.In 1983, for instance, a Soviet early-warning system detected an incoming American nuclear attack. It happened to be a moment of high tension in which the Kremlin had feared a pre-emptive strike.Because of missile advances that had come as part of the arms race, the Soviets had only 23 minutes to respond before the missiles would land \u2014 not enough time to double-check equipment, much less negotiate with Washington. The arms race also dictated that the Soviet Union respond with overwhelming retaliation against the United States, to quickly neutralize any further threat.The Soviet officer in charge of the early-warning station could see no evidence of a false alarm, but told his superiors that it was. His guess, proved correct, may have saved the world.Though the episode would not become public for years, Mr. Reagan wrote in his memoirs that another war scare, which occurred that same month when Soviet forces shot down a South Korean airliner that had wandered into Soviet airspace, \u201cdemonstrated how close the world had come to the precipice and how much we needed nuclear arms control.\u201dMr. Reagan principally turned against the arms race because of its dangers, but others came to oppose it for the simple reason that, after decades and billions or perhaps trillions of dollars, it had failed to accomplish victory.\u201cBuilding nukes to get others to stop historically has had the same effect as telling everyone in an email storm to cease using \u2018Reply All,\u2019 \u201d Joshua H. Pollack, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, joked on Twitter.Mr. Pollack added, \u201cThere is no last, winning move when it comes to arms racing.\u201dThe first response came from Cheryl Rofer, a retired nuclear scientist at the Los Alamos National Research Laboratory: \u201cBut there is a last move.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pat McCrory, North Carolina Governor, Concedes After Acrimonious Race", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Ending an acrimonious stalemate that dragged on for nearly a month, Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, conceded in his bid for re-election here on Monday, clearing the way for the ascension of his challenger, the Democrat Roy Cooper, and giving the national Democratic Party a rare cause for celebration.Mr. Cooper, the state attorney general, declared victory on election night, but Mr. McCrory\u2019s allies lodged election challenges in dozens of North Carolina counties, enraging Democrats who accused Republicans of being sore losers, or worse, in one of 2016\u2019s closest statewide races.Most of the challenges proved to be of little consequence, however. And by Monday, as partial results of a recount of more than 90,000 votes that Republicans had demanded in Durham County showed no significant change in the results, Mr. McCrory \u2014 whose one term was buffeted by nationwide anger over a law he signed that curbed anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2014 had little choice but to admit defeat.\u201cDespite continued questions that should be answered regarding the voting process, I personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken and we now should do everything we can to support the 75th governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper,\u201d Mr. McCrory said in a video statement released on Monday.Mr. Cooper issued a written statement moments after. \u201cIt will be the honor of my life to serve this great state,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile this was a divisive election season, I know still that there is more that unites us than divides us. Together, we can make North Carolina the shining beacon in the south by investing in our schools, supporting working families and building a state that works for everyone.\u201dThe sealing of Mr. Cooper\u2019s victory \u2014 he leads by just over 10,000 votes in the unofficial state tally \u2014 brings a modicum of relief to Democrats here. Many of them had feared a post-Election Day power play by North Carolina\u2019s Republicans, who control the state\u2019s General Assembly, where the Republicans in recent years have enacted aggressive gerrymandering plans and a law curtailing voter access that have been struck down by the federal courts. Some feared that the Republicans would take advantage of a law that allows contested elections to be settled by a vote of the legislature.Nationally, the Democrats face far broader challenges. Mr. Cooper takes office in a year when Republicans further consolidated their dominance of governors\u2019 offices on Nov. 8, with the total number of Republican governorships rising to 33 from 31.Mr. Cooper, 59, who has served as North Carolina\u2019s attorney general since 2001, positioned himself as the kind of moderate Democrat who set the tone in state government here for many years before 2010, when Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time since the late 19th century. Republicans further consolidated power in 2012 with the election of Mr. McCrory.As a mayor of Charlotte, Mr. McCrory was known as a moderate and pragmatist, a reputation that attracted many Democrats to his 2012 campaign. But the legislature pushed, and he generally supported an ambitious conservative agenda, rolling back the state\u2019s generous ballot-access rules. The legislature also passed expanded rights for gun owners, a private-school voucher plan, new abortion regulations and a tax overhaul that opponents criticized for favoring the wealthy.The backlash, in a state with one of the South\u2019s most vigorous liberal contingents, was perhaps inevitable. In 2013, progressives began a sustained series of protests in Raleigh, the state capital, called \u201cMoral Mondays\u201d that galvanized opposition and drew news media attention with numerous acts of civil disobedience.Mr. McCrory, who often seemed caught in the middle of these two forces, suffered his biggest blow beginning in March, when he signed the law commonly known as House Bill 2, or H.B. 2. The law nullified local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and it required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificates, which liberals saw as an attack on transgender rights.National lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups helped marshal nationwide opposition. Soon, major performers were canceling concerts. The N.C.A.A. and the Atlantic Coast Conference moved sports championships out of the state. The N.B.A. moved its All-Star Game to New Orleans.This undercut Mr. McCrory\u2019s central argument for re-election: that he had been a good steward of the state economy and had engineered a \u201cCarolina comeback\u201d with regulatory and tax relief that helped lower the state\u2019s unemployment rate.Mr. Cooper\u2019s television ads argued that H.B. 2 had \u201ctrashed\u201d the North Carolina brand. In a number of ads, Mr. Cooper, who hails from rural Nash County, appeared smiling and positive, speaking directly to the camera in his gentle drawl, arguing that developments like H.B. 2 had also caused the state to take its eye off more important priorities.\u201cInstead of social issues, I\u2019ll focus on our schools and keeping good teachers with better pay,\u201d he said in one.In a statement on Monday, Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, said: \u201cPat McCrory\u2019s reign of discrimination is finally over. McCrory\u2019s stubborn and reckless support of H.B. 2 cost him this election, and his defeat sends a powerful warning to lawmakers across the country that targeting L.G.B.T.Q. people will not be tolerated.\u201dBut Mr. Cooper will come into office seriously constrained by the Republican legislature. In addition to other humiliations for Democrats \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump won North Carolina, and Republican Senator Richard M. Burr cruised to re-election \u2014 the Democrats, despite their pre-election confidence, failed to pick up enough seats in the State House of Representatives to undo a veto override power of the Republicans.Whether Mr. Cooper will be able to act as anything more than a figurehead remains to be seen. What appears more likely is a continuation \u2014 if not an amplification \u2014 of the acrimony between the two parties in the wake of the Republicans\u2019 challenges of the election.Democrats have interpreted the challenges as an effort to delegitimize Mr. Cooper before his swearing in, and perhaps lay the groundwork for further restrictions on voting. As Mr. Cooper\u2019s allies called on Mr. McCrory to concede and drop the challenges, a McCrory campaign spokesman, Ricky Diaz, said, \u201cWhy is Roy Cooper so insistent on circumventing the electoral process and counting the votes of dead people and felons?\u201dDallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the state Republican Party, prefers to emphasize that about half of the 43 votes by the supposed felons were, in fact, ineligible. In an interview on Sunday, he argued that the challenges were legitimate, particularly one in Bladen County that charged that hundreds of mail-in absentee ballots were cast fraudulently.\u201cWe have made multiple efforts to try to look at these things from a sober perspective,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe Democrats tried to intimidate us by saying you can\u2019t question anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Mick Mulvaney, Trump Finds Anti-Establishment Leader for Budget Office", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byThese tight-knit South Carolinians have since gone their own ways professionally. Tim Scott is now a senator. Trey Gowdy became a conservative hero as he led a House committee to study the 2012 attack in Benghazi. And Jeff Duncan has become a social media voice for the right.In Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Trump has chosen for the Office of Management and Budget a spending hard-liner to join an economic team that could be ideologically in conflict, setting up possible collisions during major policy-making next year.The team includes at Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner turned hedge fund manager who has spoken favorably of infrastructure spending that Mr. Mulvaney has opposed; a commerce secretary nominee, Wilbur Ross, known for the billions of dollars he has earned through international investing; and a National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, who as president of Goldman Sachs has channeled tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to Democrats as well as Republicans.Mr. Mulvaney, who did not respond to emails seeking comment, has cut an influential swath among House conservatives since he was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, when he defeated a longtime representative, John Spratt, a Democrat. He won by characterizing his opponent as a big-spending liberal, unconcerned about fiscal prudence, even though as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt was among his party\u2019s leading deficit hawks.Since then, Mr. Mulvaney has perpetually rejected short-term spending agreements and questioned the government\u2019s need to increase its statutory borrowing limits to avoid default. He has repeatedly opposed some of his own party\u2019s budget proposals, and quickly established himself as one of the most outspoken members of that 2010 class of Republicans. By 2013, at the start of his second term, he declined to support Mr. Boehner\u2019s re-election as speaker, abstaining from the vote in protest.At the same time, unlike some members of the caucus, Mr. Mulvaney, 49, has also supported Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner\u2019s successor as speaker, and has served as a quiet back channel between Mr. Ryan and conservative members. Impish and sometimes short-tempered, Mr. Mulvaney seemed to chafe at serving in the shadow of Mr. Gowdy and Mr. Scott, who are best friends and shining stars in their party and home state.Mr. Mulvaney has now found a political home where he can stand out.He has often served as an articulate spokesman for the right\u2019s spending and social-policy positions, far more than many other Freedom Caucus members, who often seem more concerned with self-promotion than policy persuasion.\u201cMick is a great choice to lead the O.M.B.,\u201d Mr. Scott said on Saturday. \u201cWe entered Congress together in 2010, and I am certain he will tackle his new position with the same passion he has represented the Fifth District with over the past six years. Facing a $20 trillion debt, we need someone committed to restoring fiscal sanity in Washington, and I am confident Mick will work to do so.\u201dAs budget director, Mr. Mulvaney would help guide a repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a promise of the president-elect \u2014 a tax overhaul and, potentially, a huge federal investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure, which, like many Republicans, he does not want.So resolute is Mr. Mulvaney on holding the spending line that in 2013, he almost single-handedly took down a $50.7 billion emergency relief bill in the wake of Hurricane Sandy by championing an amendment requiring that the package be offset dollar for dollar with across-the-board spending cuts.The amendment ultimately failed after Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey criticized Mr. Mulvaney and House Republicans sharply. But the South Carolina conservative praised the 162 votes the measure received as a harbinger for future fights over emergency relief bills.That campaign could re-emerge in cabinet fights if Mr. Trump insists on pressing forward with a $1 trillion program to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. If, as Mr. Trump has said, such a program is intended to goose economic growth and job creation, he will be at odds with his budget director, should Mr. Mulvaney insist on equivalent spending cuts elsewhere, which would make the economic impact a wash.Strongly anti-establishment, Mr. Mulvaney, who has a degree in international economics from Georgetown University and a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was irked as much by the Republican leadership in the House as he was by Mr. Obama\u2019s command from the White House.If confirmed by the Senate to run the budge office, Mr. Mulvaney would be responsible for helping to shepherd the president\u2019s spending requests through a Republican-controlled Congress.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rising Prices in Oakland Push Artists Into Risky Housing", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 San Francisco is full of big dreams. Oakland is where people make them work.The city of about 400,000 sits on the east side of San Francisco Bay and historically has served as a low-priced alternative to its more famous neighbor, a place where service workers could buy a home, young professionals could get an extra bedroom and artists lived in low-rent warehouses while sleeping beside their next installation.But over the past few years, as prices have surged across the Bay Area, Oakland\u2019s pricing advantages have mostly eroded. Rents have increased 70 percent in five years, more than in any other big city in the nation, according to Zillow, the online real estate pricing service. The city\u2019s $2,899 median rent is now among the highest, and just short of median rents in Manhattan.The conditions that led to the fire that killed at least 36 people on Friday night was a result of a dangerous mix of factors in which dozens of partygoers were invited to a warehouse that was dark, congested and mazelike, with flammable art and a jerry-built electrical system.The victims died because they were trapped in a tinderbox. Yet the economic backdrop of the tragedy is also important because it shows how rising rents and fears of eviction can push vulnerable people in a desperate search for housing to unsafe spaces.Oakland\u2019s housing prices have always fluctuated with Bay Area booms and busts, and complaints about gentrification were part of the 1990s dot-com boom here as well. The effects are more pronounced this time around because as tech companies have migrated closer to San Francisco from places like Palo Alto and Mountain View, Oakland has been pulled deeper into Silicon Valley\u2019s orbit. Uber, the ride-hailing service now valued at almost $70 billion, plans to open an office in downtown Oakland in the next year or so.This crisis isn\u2019t limited to the Bay Area. Across the country, and especially in expensive cities like New York and Seattle, urban areas have been flooded with high-paid tech and finance workers who have pushed up rents. Blue-collar workers and families have been displaced to cheaper housing on the fringe, but many creative types have made do by finding alternative living arrangements like industrial property, recreational vehicles and even boats.In Oakland, where for decades warehouses have served as a haven for artists, this often means living at the whims of any landlord willing to look the other way.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of unholy alliance in which these buildings are leased with a \u2018nod nod, wink wink, nobody lives there,\u2019 \u201d said Thomas Dolan, an Oakland architect who specializes in live/work spaces and helps building owners convert illegally occupied warehouses into legally occupied lofts. \u201cIt\u2019s a precarious situation where tenants exchange cheap rent for substandard housing \u2014 and if they rock the boat, they\u2019re out.\u201dIn the aftermath of the fire, artists\u2019 grief over lost friends quickly turned to anxiety that a crackdown could lead to widespread eviction from one of the Bay Area\u2019s few remaining sources of affordable housing.\u201cThe longer-term fear is, \u2018Does this mean the end of these spaces in the Bay Area and with it the last vestige of any kind of affordable artists community?\u2019\u201d said Aaron Muszalski, an artist who has spent the past two decades living and working in warehouses across the region.Unlike San Francisco, whose once-gritty waterfront has been transformed into a high-end neighborhood where the San Francisco Giants play next to multimillion-dollar condominiums, Oakland can still lay claim to the Bay Area\u2019s industrial past. There are bars still frequented by dockworkers, and hipsters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the hulking white cranes that line the Port of Oakland.Many of the city\u2019s industrial warehouses originally served as a waypoint where shippers stored cargo. But as international commerce was accelerated by \u201ccontainerization\u201d \u2014 the process by which rectangular crates full of products like California wine and Chinese electronics can be loaded by cranes between boats and trucks \u2014 warehouses went empty and artists moved in.The result has been a vast gray economy of live/work spaces that, legal or not, are regarded as an important source of affordable housing and part of what makes Oakland, Oakland.\u201cThere have been efforts to legalize Oakland\u2019s live/work spaces for years,\u201d said Joshua Simon, executive director the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit that helps develop affordable housing. \u201cToday it\u2019s critical that we find ways to use every housing option that\u2019s safe \u2014 the worst thing we could do would be to overreact and eliminate this type of housing as an option.\u201dThe catch, however, is that once a loft becomes legal the rent becomes unaffordable. So while living in an illegal space may require things like coping with a makeshift kitchen with a sink that drains into a bucket, it\u2019s better than living nowhere.\u201cYou bring these places up to code and you end up pricing out the people who make Oakland such a great place,\u201d Mr. Dolan said.Cheap rent is not the only draw. Several current and former warehouse residents described being absorbed into a broad community centered on building and making noise, whether it\u2019s daytime hammering and welding, or throbbing nighttime parties whose locations are secret.Part of the bonding experience is in maintaining the charade that nobody lives there.There are rituals like renting U-Haul trucks to store mattresses on days when the building owner sends an insurance inspector over. If the fire department knocks, you ignore it.Before he became the owner of the Starline Social Club, an Oakland bar and music space, Adam Hatch, 38, was part of an illegal live/work art gallery called Lobot. He remains connected with the scene, and on Monday night his bar was full of A\u2019s hats, Raiders jackets and tears as patrons observed a moment of silence for a victim who painted nails there on Monday nights.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just sort of magical to be in a place you\u2019re not supposed to be,\u201d Mr. Hatch said of the warehouse scene.But there is also a risk, as the fire at the warehouse, known as the Ghost Ship, showed. Most of the power accrues to the so-called master tenant \u2014 the person whose name is on the lease.The people who lived at Ghost Ship in the months preceding the fire painted varying pictures of that dynamic.Shelley Mack, 58, moved into one of several mobile homes housed inside the warehouse in October 2014, paying $700 a month. Soon, she said, the building\u2019s head tenant, Derick Ion Almena, was asking her for another $700, this time for upkeep. She said he cut off electricity for people who disagreed with him and blocked an upstairs exit.Others, however, said they were just happy to have a place to live. Josh Hershberger, 31, a tattoo artist and muralist, had been homeless before he found the warehouse. Mr. Almena let him pay rent by the day \u2014 $10 or $20 \u2014 and provided him with a community. \u201cThis was my home. It was a foundation.\u201dWithout the Ghost Ship, he said, he would have been on the street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Central Bank Chief to Take International Post", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The governor of Mexico\u2019s central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, said on Thursday that he would leave his position next July, adding to the uncertainty that has rattled the country\u2019s economy since the election of Donald J. Trump.Mr. Carstens, 58, a well-regarded economist, will leave the Bank of Mexico, where he has been governor for seven years, to lead the Bank for International Settlements, a financial institution based in Basel, Switzerland, that acts as a bank for central banks.It is a complex time for Mexico, as worry mounts that Mr. Trump as the United States president will make good on his campaign promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and deport Mexican migrants, anxiety that has pushed the value of the peso down to record levels.As news of Mr. Carstens\u2019s departure broke on Thursday morning, the peso slipped further, but he sought to provide some reassurance.\u201cI am still going to be here for seven more months and I hope the storm doesn\u2019t last that long,\u201d he told a news conference. His departure raises the question of who President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto will nominate as his successor to finish out the term, which ends in 2021. The president\u2019s choice requires Senate ratification.Mr. Carstens has called Mr. Trump \u201ca hurricane\u201d for the Mexican economy. The central bank raised interest rates two weeks ago and cut its growth forecast. The central bank governor said then that understanding the policies of the incoming administration in Washington was \u201clike trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together without having all the pieces.\u201dMexico is particularly vulnerable to Mr. Trump\u2019s antitrade message because its dynamic export sector is the economy\u2019s main driver. Mexico sends some 80 percent of its exports to the United States and investors fear that any disruption to North American trade would hit Mexico disproportionately.\u201cThe timing of the decision is far from ideal,\u201d wrote Daniel Kerner and Carlos Petersen at the Eurasia Group, a risk analysis and consulting group. \u201cInvestors and politicians saw Carstens as a bulwark of macroeconomic responsibility and independence who could help navigate these troubled waters, at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising rates and Trump\u2019s policies could begin to further harm Mexico\u2019s economy.\u201dAlthough Mr. Carstens tried to play down the effect of his departure, arguing that he was just one member of the central bank\u2019s board, he did acknowledge that \u201cif there is one thing that characterizes the moment we\u2019re living through, it is uncertainty.\u201dDespite a long career at the central bank and Mexico\u2019s finance ministry, Mr. Carstens was known to be considering an international position. In 2011, he unsuccessfully sought the position as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Although there was speculation that he had a difficult relationship with the finance team of President Pe\u00f1a Nieto, \u201cthe decision seems to have been driven mostly by Carstens\u2019s own professional interests rather than political pressures or disagreements over monetary policy,\u201d the Eurasia Group analysts wrote.Finance Minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade described Mr. Carstens\u2019s selection at the Bank for International Settlements, which promotes international monetary and financial cooperation, as an honor for Mexico.\u201cThere is an additional element that gives us a lot of calm today,\u201d Mr. Meade said. \u201cThe decision is being announced today but it won\u2019t be implemented until near the end of next year.\u201dMr. Carstens\u2019s departure presents a dilemma for the president. \u201cNow President Pe\u00f1a Nieto faces a momentous decision to propose a solid candidate with credibility, even more so when there is no natural successor,\u201d wrote analysts at Citibanamex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shanghai\u2019s Move to Curb International Programs in Schools Worries Parents", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 For the past two years, Wu Dongmei\u2019s 14-year-old son has been attending a private school in Shanghai that offers an international program that prepares students for higher education abroad. All had proceeded smoothly \u2014 until recently, she said.On Oct. 19, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission summoned the principals of 21 local private schools to explain draft regulations that would restrict international programs in Grades 1 through 9, the years of compulsory education in China. The commission accused schools that had replaced the officially mandated curriculum, which includes classes in political ideology, of \u201cinfringing on China\u2019s education sovereignty.\u201dThe commission said that under the proposed regulations the authorities would no longer approve the establishment of any new private schools with \u201cforeign influence\u201d and would \u201cbar foreign investment in private schools.\u201d School curriculums would be monitored to ensure that they \u201cuphold national sovereignty and ideology.\u201d Private schools could not be named after foreigners.The rules would not apply to international schools set up primarily to educate foreign students.Now Ms. Wu is worried that the programs her son, who is in the ninth grade, is enrolled in might be replaced.\u201cParents have been talking about the regulations, and some are even prepared to send their kids to schools overseas if there are major changes,\u201d she said in an interview. She asked that her son\u2019s school not be identified, out of concern that it might cause problems for him.\u201cThe government has maintained tight ideological control over the universities, and high schools are entirely focused on test preparation, but there has been room for innovation in the grades 1-to-9 system,\u201d Mr. Jiang said. \u201cAs the Chinese economy slows and instability grows, the government wants to ensure maximum control in the classroom.\u201dMany private schools also omit the ideological instruction on Marxism and patriotism that is compulsory in public schools.Ms. Wu wondered whether the government might also require such courses in private schools, which have a high degree of autonomy in devising curriculums and teaching methods. \u201cI believe politics should be separated from school education, although I know in China it\u2019s difficult,\u201d she said.Driving the trend are wealthy families willing to pay for what they see as a higher-quality education.

{"Headline": "The Central Banks Alone Can\u2019t Save Us", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTurning PointsI have been coping with tennis elbow in one arm for most of this year and have had to rely much more on the other \u2014 excessively, it turns out. Entering the new year, there are now limits on what I can lift, pull and twist with either arm. Should I fail to do something about this, I could spend 2017 struggling with simple tasks, such as carrying a briefcase.In a way, this is an apt analogy for the global economy\u2019s disappointing performance in 2016, pointing to what\u2019s needed if we are to fight financial instability and worsening economic and political malaise in 2017.It was a tepid, strange year for the global economy. An already prolonged and frustrating period of insufficient and scattered growth simply continued as the world remained over-reliant on central banks.Since 2010, the use of fiscal policy, where the government adjusts its spending and taxation to manage the economy, has been hindered by the perception, especially in the United States and Europe, that such policies represent overreach. This has resulted in concerns about debt and unnecessary interference in the private sector, ushering in a period of excessive austerity, in terms of decreased government spending, in several advanced countries, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain. This has also sidelined any sustained fiscal stimulus in countries with strong balance sheets, such as Germany.The resulting fiscal paralysis, combined with insufficient progress on progrowth structural reforms \u2014 including revamping corporate taxes, building better infrastructure and training workers \u2014 hit those countries\u2019 middle and lower classes particularly hard and aggravated the impact of joblessness, especially among the young. As the pressure on household incomes increased, the prospects for consumer spending became more uncertain, and companies became less enthusiastic about investing in new plants and equipment, feeding into the cycle. Economic conditions remained difficult, and the politics of anger gained momentum.The need for greater fiscal policy flexibility attracted much more support among economists in 2016. But the effort to translate that support into action was frustrated by social and political polarization that essentially precluded any major economic policy initiative.As growth remained stuck in low gear, falling short of people\u2019s aspirations and dimming the hope of re-creating the economy of earlier years, the benefits of this limited growth were perceived to have collected disproportionately in the pockets of those who were better off already. Alarming pockets of under- and unemployment, particularly in Europe, became more deeply embedded in the economy\u2019s structure, adding to the headwinds. Popular anger continued to rise, and mistrust of the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 both of government and the business sector \u2014 deepened. Economics, finance and politics became increasingly interlocked in a menacing, self-perpetuating cycle of disruption.Citizens of the United Kingdom voted in June to dismantle the country\u2019s deep trading and financial links with Europe, which have served it well for four decades. Antitrade rhetoric dominated the United States presidential election, from Donald J. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on China and Mexico to Hillary Clinton\u2019s distancing herself from trade agreements with Asia, South America and the European Union that the Obama administration had painstakingly negotiated. Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8 illustrated the growing influence of anti-establishment movements.With fiscal and structural policies impaired \u2014 with both arms incapacitated \u2014 central banks were the only game in town, in an economy that needed high, sustainable and inclusive growth. Since they enjoy a considerable degree of political autonomy, they felt morally obliged to do whatever they could, even though they lacked the proper tools for the task. For the most part, theirs are limited to monetary measures, where central banks influence the economy by adjusting interest rates and the money supply to change financial conditions and asset preferences.Despite their willingness to take on others\u2019 policy responsibilities, central bankers were unable to deliver on their objectives, and for good reasons: The supply impact of their tools, such as changing interest rates or buying and selling market securities, could not lift structural impediments to growth, such as a lack of infrastructure, fragmented tax regimes and excessive regulation; and the demand influences, like decreasing interest rates to spur consumption and investment, were too weak to power the economy forward in its current state. Yet, since they were the only institution with the flexibility to address the problems, the central banks refused to walk away, continuing to administer their imperfect \u2014 even experimental \u2014 prescriptions.The result included policy outcomes that, not so long ago, were virtually unthinkable. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank took their interest rates negative \u2014 that is, below 0 percent \u2014 leaving some investors in the highly unusual position of having to pay, rather than receive, interest income if they held government bonds. With that, around 30 percent of the total stock of global government debt traded with negative yield.During most of 2016, stock markets were unusually immune to the uncertainty that has dominated the economic, financial, institutional and political landscapes. For that, investors had liquidity to thank \u2014 that is, the continuous injection of money into the markets, whether from central banks\u2019 unconventional measures or the recycling of corporate cash through mergers, acquisitions and share buybacks. But there is a limit to how long this counterintuitive combination of unstable fundamentals and market calm can persist.While the exact timing of economic and financial turning points is inherently hard to predict, we could experience an important one in 2017. But that need not be a scary proposition if politicians resume their economic governance responsibilities.A comprehensive policy response would focus on pro-growth structural reforms (including tax reform), greater fiscal activism (particularly in building infrastructure), lifting pockets of over-indebtedness (for example, in Greece and, pre-emptively, for parts of student loans in the United States), and improving cross-border policy coordination (both at the global level and in strengthening the eurozone\u2019s regional economic architecture). This would unleash some of the considerable cash idling on corporate balance sheets, in that way turbocharging two critical transitions: from low growth to high and more inclusive growth, and from artificial financial stability to genuine financial stability.But if politicians continue to fail voters, low growth will risk turning into recession, artificial financial stability will give way to unsettling instability, and the politics of anger could get a lot messier. The alternatives we face are stark, and time is pressing.The treatment for tennis elbow is rest.

But Ms. Park and Ms. Choi are only two among the South Korean elite who behave with impunity.

{"Headline": "Japan, Looking for Money, Removes Ban on Casino Gambling", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan is dealing itself into the multibillion-dollar casino industry.Lawmakers have cleared the way for blackjack, roulette and other casino games in the country, approving legislation that removes a longstanding prohibition against gambling.The legislation, passed on Thursday, is a major victory in a longstanding effort to make Japan attractive to gamblers. For years, Japanese businesses and the tax authorities have watched enviously as vast sums have poured into jurisdictions like Macau and Singapore, which have built sparkling casino resorts catering to international gamblers, especially those from China.Japan is experiencing its own boom in Chinese tourism, and it sees casinos as an added way to cash in. Estimates of the potential size of the industry have ranged as high as $40 billion a year.\u201cFor the investment community, Japan is seen as the crown jewel of Asian gaming development outside of Macau,\u201d said Grant Govertsen, a research analyst at Union Gaming, an investment bank focused on gambling.The Japanese market, with its large and affluent local population, could be even bigger.\u201cIt would be shocking if Japan doesn\u2019t become the No. 2 market in Asia on an overnight basis\u201d once big resorts open, Mr. Govertsen said, adding that the exact size of the market is difficult to gauge until regulatory elements, like the number and location of licenses, are known.The vote came as Japan looks for new sources of economic growth. Tourism is emerging as a newly powerful force in the country, where the economy has traditionally been geared more toward exporting cars and other manufactured goods than importing pleasure-seeking visitors. More than 20 million foreign tourists have made trips to Japan this year, triple the number from a decade ago, many from China\u2019s swelling middle class.The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hopes the boom will ignite broader economic growth and make up for dwindling competitiveness in other industries \u2014 some of which, like consumer electronics, are now dominated by China.The end of the prohibition on casinos does not mean that anyone could build the next Caesars Palace in Japan. At first, licenses likely will be granted to two or three so-called integrated resorts \u2014 which combine casinos with hotels, conference halls and shopping centers \u2014 in major cities. Rules governing the bidding and licensing process, as well as the regulation of the casinos themselves, would be detailed in a separate law next year. Actual gambling is unlikely to begin before 2023, several analysts said.Takashi Kiso, chief executive of the International Casino Institute, a consultancy that has been advising would-be entrants into the Japanese market, said ownership would probably take the form of joint ventures between international gambling groups and Japanese companies. MGM Resorts, Wynn Resorts and other large operators have also expressed interest, in addition to Las Vegas Sands.\u201cLooking at the debate in Parliament, there\u2019s a lot of resistance to the idea of 100 percent foreign-owned casinos, so that is probably off the table,\u201d Mr. Kiso said.Japan has been debating whether to legalize casinos since at least 1999. A bill similar to the one passed on Thursday made progress in Parliament two years ago but never made it to a vote. Some lawmakers balked at the potential social problems caused by casinos. Among those opposed was Komeito, a Buddhist political party that is a junior partner in the governing coalition.Multiple opinion surveys have shown that more Japanese voters oppose legalizing casinos than support the idea.Since 2014, Mr. Abe\u2019s party, the Liberal Democrats, has strengthened its hold on Parliament. It is now less reliant on Komeito and has found a new ally on the casino issue in Nippon Ishin no Kai, a small, right-leaning party with a support base in the western city of Osaka. Nippon Ishin no Kai has been lobbying for one of the first casinos to be built there.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo and Neil Gough from Hong Kong.

Putin may be taking a star turn on the world stage \u2014 dominating the war in Syria and alarming European and American leaders who fear the Kremlin is undermining democracy \u2014 Russia remains in many respects a struggling country. For all his bravado, Mr. Putin continues to wrestle with domestic economic woes, widening inequality and endemic corruption.The economy, deeply dependent on oil revenues, was thrown into recession in 2015, after a collapse in oil prices, and is just now emerging tentatively into positive territory. The ensuing collapse of the ruble and Western economic sanctions over the Kremlin\u2019s maneuvers in Crimea and Ukraine have hit living standards hard.Now they are doing so again because they can no longer afford even the cheapest vodka. This is particularly true in the struggling districts outside the more prosperous cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg.The victims had consumed scented bath lotion containing methanol, a cheap substitute for the ethanol in standard alcoholic beverages. A local prosecutor, Stanislav Zubovsky, told the Interfax news agency that a total of 57 people went to hospitals over the weekend.The liquid was sold in local stores for around a dollar a bottle, compared with about $3 for a half-liter bottle of vodka.It was unclear what went wrong with the batch distributed over the weekend. Local investigators detained seven people on suspicion of distributing the liquid and discovered a workshop where they said the substance was produced. About 2,000 bottles were seized from local stores.In Moscow, Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev has called for the government to put controls on the circulation of cheap perfumes and other liquids containing alcohol.\u201cThis is a complete disgrace and clearly we should put an end to it,\u201d Mr. Medvedev told a cabinet meeting on Monday. \u201cSuch liquids should simply be banned.\u201dThe Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S.

The authorities ordered the police to check the places where homeless people sought refuge from the bitter winter cold and to post notices warning against the use of unfit substances.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Condemns the Wrong Man", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byDealBookShe took aim at an individual she described as a \u201chedge fund billionaire\u201d who is \u201cthrilled by Donald Trump\u2019s economic team of Wall Street insiders.\u201dThe hedge fund manager she condemned was Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital. Ms. Warren \u2014 the fiery Massachusetts Democrat who is known for her stern mistrust of Wall Street \u2014 called him out by saying, \u201cTilson knows that, despite all the stunts and rhetoric, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to change the economic system.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe next four years are going to be a bonanza for the Whitney Tilsons of the world.\u201dThere\u2019s one rather glaring problem with Ms. Warren\u2019s attack: Mr. Tilson happens to be one of the few financial executives who publicly fought Mr. Trump\u2019s election and supported Hillary Clinton. A lifelong Democrat who was involved in helping to start Teach for America, Mr. Tilson also happened to be one of the rare Wall Street executives who had donated to Ms. Warren and actively sought new regulations for the industry. Recently, he gave Mrs. Clinton $1,000 so he could see Ms. Warren speak at a campaign fund-raiser. (He\u2019s also far, far from a billionaire.)Ms. Warren appears to be suffering from the same affliction that Mr. Trump\u2019s critics accuse of him: a knee-jerk, fact-free reaction to something she had read in the news.In this case, Ms. Warren seems to have come across a Bloomberg News article that includes some quotations from Mr. Tilson. But she didn\u2019t read to the bottom or dismissed it before firing off her zingers.The part Ms. Warren may have missed toward the bottom was this: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Dodd-Frank, I think banking should be boring,\u201d he was quoted as saying, where he was also identified as a Clinton supporter. \u201cI worry about Wall Street returning to being a casino.\u201dIn fairness, depending on how you look at the situation, it is possible some readers and supporters of Ms. Warren will give her kudos for criticizing one of her own well-heeled donors. \u201cShe can\u2019t be bought,\u201d might be a generous way to consider the situation. But even a quick Google search of Mr. Tilson\u2019s involvement in the recent political discourse over financial reform would reveal what he clearly meant by his quotation: that he was nervous about Mr. Trump appointing reckless and uninformed people to guide financial policy and that he was heartened that he had not.As Ms. Warren has made clear, she abhors the idea of anyone who has worked in the financial industry working in government on policy that could affect the economy and Wall Street. This column has covered what I\u2019ve described as her misguided view.That\u2019s not to say any administration wouldn\u2019t benefit from bringing in some outsiders who could offer new and different perspectives, but that can\u2019t be a qualifying measure. The next time you need heart surgery, do you want to go to a heart surgeon or a psychologist?In fairness, Ms. Warren\u2019s ambitious efforts to overhaul financial regulation are not without merit: There are large parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that have done a ton of good to protect the American public. She played a hugely important role recently in grilling the chief executive of Wells Fargo about his bank\u2019s sham-accounts scandal, and her questioning appears to have helped bring about his resignation. And at a time when one party is in power \u2014 in this case, the Republicans \u2014 Ms. Warren\u2019s position is even more important to help hold our leaders accountable.However, her ad hominem attack on Mr. Tilson only serves to undermine her credibility and some of the good work she wants to achieve.To make matters worse, Mr. Tilson\u2019s wife, Susan Blackman Tilson, was one of the students in the first Harvard Law School bankruptcy class that Ms. Warren taught, in fall 1992. The student has remained loyal to her professor; Mrs. Tilson wrote in a letter to Ms. Warren last week that she had been \u201ccheering from the sidelines as you rose to national attention for your excellent work on behalf of consumers.\u201dBoth of the Tilsons sent letters to Ms. Warren last week, which they shared with me, seeking to set the record straight and asking her to remove her Facebook post.The response? An aide emailed them: \u201cShe asked me to relay to you that she is removing the word \u2018billionaire\u2019 from the post, as you have indicated that is factually inaccurate. The senator has decided, however, not to remove the overall post.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Warren declined to comment on the exchange.When I spoke to Mr. Tilson on Monday, he said he felt that the senator had let him down in two ways: \u201cPersonally, I feel betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent years, I\u2019ve really stuck my neck out by very publicly supporting her, the C.F.P.B., and a tough regulatory approach to banks \u2014 none of which wins me many friends \u2014 and this is how she repays me.\u201dMr. Tilson added: \u201cBy engaging in factually incorrect, ad hominem attacks, she\u2019s getting down into the gutter with Trump. This is misguided and counterproductive.\u201dDespite all of that, he said, \u201cI still support her because I share her belief that banking should be boring.\u201dNaturally enough, he added, her Facebook post, coupled with her response, \u201ccertainly reduces my enthusiasm for her.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trump Economic Boom? The Fed May Stand in the Way", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels.To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates.\u201cI guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. \u201cIf we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn\u2019t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There\u2019s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates.\u201dUnderscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives.Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook.During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a single-minded goal of short-term job creation.\u201cOur No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month.Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful; the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom.Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth.The central bank\u2019s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1.8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely.For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that \u2014 and the Fed has concluded that it is too late.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates.\u201cWith the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio at around 77 percent, there\u2019s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,\u201d she said.The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion.Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years.Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and deficit-financed spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump\u2019s four-year term. But he said that the Fed\u2019s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be \u201cunnervingly close\u201d to recession.\u201cThe Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit,\u201d Mr. Zandi said Monday. \u201cThe economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished.\u201dOther economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was \u201cbroadly appropriate.\u201dSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals also could increase the economy\u2019s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment.On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thomas C. Schelling, Master Theorist of Nuclear Strategy, Dies at 95", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byThomas C. Schelling, an economist and Nobel laureate whose interest in game theory led him to write important works on nuclear strategy and to use the concept of the tipping point to explain social problems, including white flight from urban neighborhoods, died on Tuesday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 95.The death was confirmed by Richard Zeckhauser, a former student and colleague.It was while working as an economist in the Truman administration that Professor Schelling became intrigued by the stratagems and negotiating ploys that he observed in international bargaining. In particular, as the Cold War developed, he became fascinated with the complexities of nuclear strategy, then in its infancy and a source of worldwide anxiety.After spending a year studying nuclear weapons at the RAND Corporation in 1958 and writing \u201cThe Strategy of Conflict\u201d (1960), he took his place as a leading theorist of nuclear war and peace along with the RAND intellectuals Herman Kahn and Albert Wohlstetter, as well as Henry A. Kissinger, the director of the Defense Studies Center at Harvard.Professor Schelling analyzed superpower negotiations in the way that he analyzed the conflicts between, say, a blackmailer and his client, a parent and a child, or management and labor. In each case, he wrote, \u201cthere is a mutual dependence as well as opposition,\u201d with each side seeking out tests of strength at less than crisis levels.Among other counterintuitive propositions he put forth, Professor Schelling suggested that one side in a negotiation can strengthen its position by narrowing its options, using as an example a driver in a game of chicken who rips the steering wheel from the steering column and brandishes it so his opponent can see that he no longer controls the car. He also argued that uncertain retaliation is more credible and more efficient than certain retaliation.\u201cThe Strategy of Conflict\u201d introduced the concept of the focal point, often called the Schelling point, to describe a solution that people reach without benefit of communicating, relying instead on \u201ceach person\u2019s expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do.\u201dPeople separated geographically, for instance, will rendezvous at a prominent landmark. Mr. Schelling used the example of strangers arranging to meet in Manhattan. Posing this problem to a group of students, he found that the most popular choice was the information booth at Grand Central Terminal at noon. The time and the place were given preference by tradition, and that preference was anticipated by all.In the film, the Soviet \u201cdoomsday device,\u201d set to respond automatically to a nuclear assault by the United States, was, Mr. Schelling said, a poor piece of gamesmanship.\u201cOne obvious point in the Strangelove movie was that the Soviet doomsday thing was not a deterrent when the other side did not know in advance that it existed,\u201d he pointed out in an interview with The New York Times in 2005, when he and the Israeli economist Robert J. Aumann were awarded the Nobel in economic science.The prize, formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was conferred on both men for \u201chaving enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis.\u201dIn the 1970s, Professor Schelling moved on to other social questions that seemed to be fertile ground for game theory, notably the dynamics behind racial change in American neighborhoods.Expanding on the work of Morton Grodzins, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who used the term \u201ctip point\u201d to describe the crucial moment when white fears become white flight, Mr. Schelling offered a simple diagram, almost like a game board, to show how mixed urban neighborhoods could quickly become entirely black, even when white residents expressed only a slight preference for living among members of their own race.His papers on the subject, and his book \u201cMicromotives and Macrobehavior\u201d (1978), achieved wider currency when his ideas were popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his best-selling book \u201cThe Tipping Point\u201d (2000).Despite being identified with game theory, Professor Schelling described himself as an opportunistic user of its ideas, bringing them in when needed and sometimes not at all.\u201cWhen people ask me what game theory is, my answer is that it is an attempt to formalize any kind of study of strategic behavior where people are trying to affect or anticipate the behavior of others,\u201d he told The Baltimore Sun. \u201cSo all kinds of people are game theorists. Organized labor of the 1930s. The underworld is full of extortionists who are good at it. Most of what I did with very few exceptions can be understood without having any idea what game theory is.\u201dThomas Crombie Schelling was born on April 14, 1921, in Oakland, Calif. His father, John, was a Naval officer. His mother, the former Zelda Ayres, was a schoolteacher. His interest in mass unemployment in the Depression led him to major in economics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1944.In 1947, he married Corinne Saposs. The marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Alice Coleman; four sons, Andrew, Thomas, Daniel and Robert; two stepsons, Robert and David Coleman; a sister, Nancy Schelling Dorfman; eight grandchildren; four step-grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.After working as an analyst for the federal Bureau of the Budget, Mr. Schelling enrolled in Harvard and, on completing his course work, spent two years in Denmark and France as an economist for the Economic Cooperation Administration, the agency created to carry out the Marshall Plan, the American effort to revitalize Europe after World War II.In 1950, he joined the White House staff of the foreign policy adviser to the president, which in 1951, became the Office of the Director for Mutual Security, which managed all foreign aid programs.He published his first book, \u201cNational Income Behavior: An Introduction to Algebraic Analysis,\u201d in 1951, the year he received his doctorate from Harvard. He joined Yale\u2019s economics department in 1953 and in 1958 became a professor of economics at Harvard, where he taught until 1990.That year, he was named a distinguished university professor in the University of Maryland\u2019s Department of Economics and School of Public Policy. He retired in 2003.In \u201cInternational Economics\u201d (1958), his second book, Professor Schelling analyzed trade agreements and competition, but he had already begun to think about cooperation and conflict in a nuclear context. With the publication of \u201cGames and Decisions: Introduction and Critical Survey\u201d by Howard Raiffa and R. Duncan Luce in 1957, he began to apply game theory to his arguments.In a long article that took up an entire issue of The Journal of Conflict Resolution in 1958, he tried to persuade game theorists to pay attention to a wide range of strategic activities, including promises and threats, tacit bargaining, the design of enforceable contracts and rules, and the tactics by which individuals or firms or governments committed themselves.After becoming interested in theories of deterrence and limited war, he decided that nuclear strategy lent itself to his evolving ideas about bargaining and game theory. He explored this avenue at RAND, in the book \u201cStrategy and Arms Control\u201d (1961), written with the nuclear theorist Morton H. Halperin, and in influential papers like \u201cUncertainty, Brinkmanship and the Game of Chicken.\u201dOne of his central arguments was that two sides to a conflict often reached tacit understandings rather than formal agreements.In his Nobel speech, he noted that the Soviet Union took the public position that any European war would automatically become a nuclear conflict, yet at the same time, Moscow poured immense resources into building up conventional forces that in theory would be useless in a nuclear war.This policy reflected an \u201cunacknowledged arms-control understanding\u201d between the United States and the Soviet Union that was, he said, the most important agreement of the Cold War, after the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty.Professor Schelling explored nuclear bargaining further in \u201cArms and Influence\u201d (1966).\u201cWe had a hell of a time getting that damn war started,\u201d he told The Sun. \u201cWe finally decided that it couldn\u2019t happen unless there was somebody crazy in the Air Force. That\u2019s when Kubrick and Peter George decided they would have to do it as what they called a nightmare comedy.\u201dAlthough Professor Schelling was identified in the public mind as a steely rationalist on the nuclear question \u2014 \u201cThese are the men who believe in the balance of terror, who feel that we must proceed with reason and think about the unthinkable,\u201d a fellow academic critic complained about him and theorists like Herman Kahn in 1963 \u2014 he led a delegation of Harvard scholars in 1970 to sit down with Mr. Kissinger, then the national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, and voice opposition to the bombing of Cambodia.It was around this time that Professor Schelling published \u201cModels of Segregation\u201d in The American Economic Review, to illustrate a law of unintended consequences. Using Xs and Os, he showed how one group \u2014 whether racial, ethnic, linguistic, economic or sexual \u2014 would inevitably set off an exodus merely by trying to avoid minority status in their neighborhood, even if its members stated a preference for living in a mixed neighborhood.\u201cWhites and blacks may not mind each other\u2019s presence, may even prefer integration, but may nevertheless wish to avoid minority status,\u201d he wrote in a different version of the essay \u201cMicromotives and Macrobehavior.\u201d \u201cExcept for a mixture of 50:50, no mixture will then be self-sustaining because there is none without a minority, and if the minority evacuates, complete segregation occurs.\u201dHe then invited readers to test the model using pennies and dimes on a grid.In other chapters of the book, Professor Schelling used thermostats, hockey helmets and the game of musical chairs to illustrate other problems of contingent behavior \u2014 behavior that depends on what other people do \u2014 and strategic interdependence.In 2009, William Easterly, an economist at New York University, applied a real-world test to Mr. Schelling\u2019s abstract tipping-point model of racial segregation. Analyzing census tract data for metropolitan areas of the United States from 1970 to 2000, he found more white flight out of neighborhoods with a high initial share of whites than out of more racially mixed neighborhoods.\u201cI continue to respect the Schelling model as a brilliant theoretical accomplishment that formalized loose language about \u2018tipping,\u2019\u201d Mr. Easterly wrote in an email in 2011. \u201cIndeed, it is only because of Schelling formalizing the tipping story and its predictions that it became feasible for me to test the conventional wisdom on tipping.\u201dMr. Schelling later turned his attention to addictive behavior and climate change. In both, he found intriguing the strategies of self-constraint and bargaining, which he discussed in \u201cChoice and Consequence\u201d (1984) and \u201cStrategies of Commitment\u201d (2006).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tender Side of Edward Albee", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported by\u201cHe was, I came to realize, trying to cultivate taste.\u201dI met Edward Albee when I was in my early 20s. I had just graduated from N.Y.U., where I\u2019d studied to be an actor. Someone who knew Albee told me he was looking for an assistant, and suggested I put myself up for the job.The interview was held in Albee\u2019s TriBeCa loft, stuffed floor to ceiling with art. Kandinsky, Chagall, Picasso. The great man sat among them \u2014 that legendary twinkle in his eye, his Irish wolfhounds at his feet.There is nothing quite like meeting one of your idols in his own home. You think: This person living and breathing in front of me wakes up in the space where I\u2019m greeting him, then goes on to make plays that shape the world. It\u2019s a good kind of awe to feel when you\u2019re young and ambitious. Daunting and galvanizing in equal measure.At the time, he was out of critical favor. It didn\u2019t seem to be affecting him much. Yes, he mentioned it. But with a wry smile, full of a sly bemusement, as if he were thinking, \u201cIsn\u2019t life odd that I would be treated so?\u201d Otherwise, he was cheerful, talking about his travels and African art, and about the theater he was attending almost every night. He was up on all the new plays and playwrights.He also talked about his childhood love of vaudeville \u2014 which was his family\u2019s business \u2014 the theater of the absurd, musical revues, O\u2019Neill, Genet. His tastes were extremely catholic.I was mesmerized. I had recently decided I no longer wanted to be an actor and yet had zero idea what my next move would be. I was interning at Mabou Mines but was also drawn to Bunraku, anything at Dance Theater Workshop, as well as the plays of Churchill, Mamet, Orton, Wilson.In the still, quiet space, with the afternoon light coming in from Harrison Street, I could tell he was measuring my words. Finally, he reached a verdict. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to be my assistant. But you might want to be a playwright.\u201dThe thought had never occurred to me.I began writing plays.Years later, I found out that Albee, whose early goal was to be a poet, had shown his poems to Thornton Wilder. Wilder apparently read each carefully, then suggested Albee write plays instead. Now, my playwriting career was not what Albee\u2019s was to Wilder\u2019s, but Albee had somehow seen something in me that I had not yet seen in myself. This was another gift from Albee. Who soon became \u201cEdward.\u201dHe spoke with contempt about Hollywood and the writers who went there. TV had yet to begin its renaissance, and Hollywood was a place where writers slouched in disgrace. I held my tongue. I never revealed my admiration for Mike Nichols\u2019s work on \u201cVirginia Woolf,\u201d especially knowing how Edward had frowned on the film\u2019s \u201chopeful\u201d ending, its \u201csentimental\u201d score.I never mentioned I wished more of his plays had been made into movies in that jaggedy, in-your-face Cassavetes style. That there was something exhilarating about being trapped with those monsters, and their words, in those fat, messy close-ups. Each word of dialogue measured for its vitality, its maximum punch. For its ability to do damage. To wake people up to themselves.As I write this from Los Angeles, where I now write for television, I often think of those words, his awareness of their currency and energy, their ultimate economy. This is precisely what\u2019s needed on the small screen. It\u2019s also what Edward Albee began encouraging in me from our first meeting.\u201cOnward, Edward.\u201dIn the last years of his life, there was an ebb and flow to his memory. But the noble mind was not overthrown. In August, I visited him at his Montauk home, which years before Uta Hagen had encouraged him to buy. Mercedes Ruehl was there, and his devoted caretaker, ironically named Martha.It was a beautiful late summer day. As I began to leave, I uncharacteristically leaned over and kissed him on the forehead. \u201cI love you,\u201d I said. He grasped my hand, staring in my eyes intently and whispering softly, said, \u201cONWARD.\u201dElizabeth Ireland McCann has produced more than 40 shows in New York and London.\u201cTo kiss or not to kiss?\u201dI first met Edward Albee when his good friend Irene Worth, knowing how greatly I admired him \u2014 venerated him really \u2014 took me to his annual Christmas party. Desperately did I try to fascinate that night; dismally did I fail. A second encounter ended just as badly when I was called to read for his new play a year later and acquitted myself so miserably that I wound up on the street in tears.There is no dejection worse than the one that comes with the death of a dream. So it was an utterly unexpected dropped-from-heaven day when I was offered the part of Martha in \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d opposite Patrick Stewart at the Guthrie Theater. Albee had somehow \u2014 had he mistaken me for someone else? \u2014 approved!The night of the first performance (the only one Albee would attend), I waited in the wings with Patrick and wondered what on earth had ever led me to chose acting as the thing to do with my life.I have no idea how I did \u2014 what I did \u2014 or how I survived \u2014 but three hours after the curtain came up, it went down \u2014 and I found myself dazed and exhausted and very much alone in a chilly dressing room in the basement of that old theater.A knock at the door.I opened it, and there he was. The big small man himself. He held his arms out for a hug, and I walked into them expecting something stiff and brief and found myself instead in a genuine embrace \u2014 strong and truly felt, even lingering \u2014 for a moment. My face somehow got tucked in his neck, and I thought: to kiss or not to kiss? I kissed.I immediately drew back aghast. My God, that was inappropriate, I thought \u2014 just wrong! But no \u2014 a pleased and open face was looking at me. A pause. \u201cIs there anything you want to tell me?\u201d I stammered. \u201cNo,\u201d he smiled and moved into the room, \u201cthat was good.\u201d I only discovered later that this was considerable praise.He sat. We spoke for a while. At first, I was terribly awkward, but as he clearly had settled in to wait out my awkwardness, I relaxed. More than the words that were said I remember a feeling of warmth crept into the room \u2014 like being by a campfire on a cold night \u2014 the kind of conversation you can have under such conditions. When he got up to leave, he turned to me and said about Martha: \u201cRemember: She loved her father very much.\u201d Another quick kiss and he was gone.I sat down at my dressing table and thought: It will take you a long time to parse what has happened to you tonight.And thus my friendship with Edward began.Mercedes Ruehl, a Tony- and Oscar-winning actress, starred in \u201cThe Goat, or Who is Sylvia?\u201d on Broadway.\u201cA spokesman for our animal needs.\u201dI first met Edward in June 1996, when I was a fellow at the Albee Foundation in Montauk. You\u2019d sometimes spot him out in the yard, coiling up a garden hose or poking a stick at something. Life at the Barn is fairly quiet, so it was fun to see a famous playwright dragging a branch by the window or staring up into a tree.This was, to me, a familiarly New Englandish way to connect; there were a number of dogs in my youth through which a lot of the family\u2019s feelings flowed. Things can get lost or go astray when you\u2019re relaying them through a dog, but with Edward, you felt a kind of clarity and ease when an animal was around. That a dog might suddenly bear its teeth or run off barking is only proof of its trustworthiness.Some version of that porch scene happened a lot, over the years: Edward and an animal and I, sitting somewhere, not saying too much but feeling, if I may speak for the other two, cared-for and calm. There was Edward\u2019s little cat, Snow, and a student\u2019s dog in Omaha that would eat grapes if you had grapes. We saw an owl one day in Houston. \u201cHe should be sleeping,\u201d Edward said, like he was about to do something about it. I once heard Edward read \u201cKrapp\u2019s Last Tape\u201d and, in an all-around gorgeous rendering, he rose particularly to the line, \u201cLet me in.\u201d You\u2019re free to picture a dog on the other side of a screen door, but of course you don\u2019t have to.Part of me just wants to write, \u201cEdward wore a lot of scratchy-looking wool shirts and pants and I miss him.\u201dWill Eno\u2019s new play, \u201cWakey, Wakey,\u201d is to open at the Signature Theater in the spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Premier, Matteo Renzi, Says He\u2019ll Resign After Reform Is Rejected", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe \u2018no\u2019 won in an incredibly clear way,\u201d Mr. Renzi said from the Chigi Palace. Holding back tears as he spoke in front of Italian and European Union flags, the usually brash and confident 41-year-old said, \u201cI assume all the responsibility of the defeat,\u201d adding that \u201cmy experience of government ends here.\u201d He said he would go later on Monday to the country\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, and \u201ctender my resignation.\u201dMr. Renzi\u2019s defeat, and the instability that his resignation is likely to cause, raised the prospect of punishment in the markets, but also a caretaker government staffed with technocrats appointed by the Italian president.Another possibility is the calling of early elections in 2017, though that, too, was unclear because Italy\u2019s new electoral law is itself under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court. The news sent the euro down sharply in Asian trading.If early elections do occur next year, 2017 is shaping up to be a seminal year in the history of the European Union with founding members Germany, France and potentially Italy all going to the polls with strong Euro-skeptic and populist candidates in the running.Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat came hours after voters in Austria, presented with a stark ideological choice for the largely ceremonial position of head of state, chose Alexander Van der Bellen, the former leader of the small Green Party, over Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Party.It was but a brief reprieve for a European political establishment that has suffered populist jolts all year. The reaction to Mr. Renzi\u2019s loss illustrated the poisonous tone of the long campaign leading up to the referendum.\u201cThe propaganda of the regime and all its lies are the first losers of this referendum,\u201d Beppe Grillo, the leader of Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement, wrote on his widely read blog. \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d he said.Luigi Di Maio, the deputy leader of the lower house of Parliament and a likely candidate for prime minister from the Five Star Movement, spoke about a coming \u201cFive Star government.\u201dAnd Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, who campaigned vigorously against Mr. Renzi\u2019s proposal, called the result \u201cnot just a defeat for Renzi but also his servant, lackeys, bankers, financiers.\u201dOstensibly the vote was about arcane changes to Italy\u2019s Constitution that would have streamlined government.But opposition to the proposals came from the same anti-establishment sentiment \u2014 spiked with skepticism of globalization, open borders and the feasibility of an ever-closer European Union \u2014 that has transformed the politics of a growing list of European countries.Such movements have already smashed the traditional political structures in Greece and Spain, and forces skeptical of the European Union led Britain to vote in June to leave the union.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, once untouchable, now seems vulnerable in next year\u2019s elections. And far-right parties are also seeking power in France.The result in Austria might have calmed some nerves, but it was the rejection of Mr. Renzi that most sent shivers through Europe and the world.In a strategic blunder that echoed David Cameron\u2019s call for a \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum, Mr. Renzi had tied his government\u2019s tenure to Sunday\u2019s vote when he was flying high in the polls.How leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.But his support eroded, and world leaders anxiously watched the vote in Italy, the fourth-largest economy in Europe, as a referendum on Mr. Renzi\u2019s centrist government and as a barometer of the strength of anti-establishment winds blowing across both sides of the Atlantic.Financial analysts have warned that instability caused by Mr. Renzi\u2019s premature departure could result in a renewed and possibly contagious financial crisis in Italy, where banks are saddled with bad loans, and where desperately needed investors are turned off by the return of Italian instability.Some world leaders, seeing in Mr. Renzi a critical defense against populism\u2019s rising tide, had urged him to stay. President Obama, speaking at the White House during Mr. Renzi\u2019s visit in October, said he hoped Mr. Renzi would \u201chang around for a while no matter what.\u201dThe incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump was less eager to see him remain. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have closely watched, and rooted for, the surging populism in Europe.What was clear, said Stefano Stefanini, who served as a diplomatic adviser to Giorgio Napolitano, a former Italian president, was that the vote was \u201ca test of strength of the anti-Europe and anti-establishment forces in Italy.\u201dRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.The primary beneficiary of Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat is Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement, a party that advocates a referendum to determine whether Italy should give up the euro.\u201cWe have the Italian people behind us,\u201d Mr. Di Maio, 30, said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd he is losing,\u201d he said of Mr. Renzi.Mr. Renzi, in an interview over the summer, compared the party\u2019s leader, Mr. Grillo, to Mr. Trump. \u201cPopulism is always the offspring of fear,\u201d Mr. Renzi said at the time. \u201cAnd in Italy, the answer to fear is the courage to not be defensive, to not be like all the others.\u201dBut Italy instead became like a growing list of European countries, and Italians seemed most moved by the message of Mr. Grillo and other leaders of his party, who campaigned tirelessly against a reform proposal they said would put too much power in the Mr. Renzi\u2019s hands.In the end, heavy opposition in the south and other regions marred by high unemployment levels proved insurmountable, and Mr. Renzi could not persuade enough moderates to stick with him and his government\u2019s plan to modernize Italy.Ultimately, the substance of the reform mattered less than voters\u2019 opinions of Mr. Renzi. In the past, personalizing politics had helped Mr. Renzi, a charismatic Florentine who came to power as a result of an internal Democratic Party coup in 2014. This time, it hurt him.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Mr. Renzi proved unable to keep walking the tightrope between outsider and insider that he had navigated so exquisitely during his rapid ascent to the apex of Italian government.On the one hand, Mr. Renzi presented himself as an anti-establishment demolition man determined to smash the gerontocracy in Italy and shock into action the out-of-touch bureaucracy in Brussels. On the other, he was the consummate insider, an ideology-allergic expert at working within the system who built unlikely coalitions to get things done.Italy, long mocked as the chaotic home of 63 governments in 70 years, emerged as a safe port of stability, and its young leader took on a special aura as a bulwark against the anti-immigrant, right-wing and radical forces.Sunday\u2019s vote erased that halo.After casting his ballot against the reform on Sunday morning, Dario Cecchi, 37, said his vote had less to do with Mr. Renzi than the substance of the proposal.Mr. Cecchi added that he was upset that Mr. Renzi had tied his political fate to the referendum, because he did not want him to step down.He said he understood that Mr. Renzi had re-established Italy as a force within Europe and that a yes vote would only increase his country\u2019s power inside the European Union.But, he said, the reform \u201cshouldn\u2019t just be good for Europe \u2014 it should be good for Italy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Thrusts Taiwan Back on the Table, Rattling a Region", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the past two decades, Taiwan has slipped from its position atop the list of flash points in the complex relationship between the United States and China. In meetings between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, it has typically come up after half a dozen more pressing issues, like trade, cyberattacks and Beijing\u2019s aggressive moves in the South China Sea.Now, though, in a single protocol-shattering phone call with the president of Taiwan, President-elect Donald J. Trump has thrust it back on the table. Not since President Richard M. Nixon met with Mao Zedong in 1972 \u2014 when the two issued the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 clarifying the status of Taiwan \u2014 has an American leader so shaken up the diplomatic status quo on the issue.\u201cTaiwan is about to become a more prominent feature of the overall U.S.-China relationship,\u201d said Jon M. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cAs a businessman, Donald Trump is used to looking for leverage in any relationship. A President Trump is likely to see Taiwan as a useful leverage point.\u201dIn the short run, Mr. Trump has rattled the entire region. Representatives of several Asian countries contacted the White House on Saturday to express concern, according to a senior administration official.In the longer term, officials in the Obama administration worry that the episode could not just ignite tensions across the Taiwan Strait but also inflame trade relations and embolden China in the South China Sea, where it has clashed with the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighbors over competing claims to reefs and shoals.Mr. Trump expressed no misgivings about taking the call from President Tsai Ing-wen, which was arranged beforehand at the initiative of the Taiwanese government, not Mr. Trump\u2019s camp.Nor did Mr. Trump or his aides make a gesture to reaffirm the One China policy, much to the chagrin of the White House. It fell to a spokesman for the National Security Council to affirm that the United States was not changing the policy. Under that policy, the United States formally recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan, as the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, sought to bolster China\u2019s economy and create closer ties to the West.Whether Mr. Trump views the call as the beginning of a change in approach toward Taiwan is not clear. A person close to him insisted that he was just being polite in taking Ms. Tsai\u2019s call. But Stephen Yates, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney who is advising the Trump transition, said in an interview that people around Mr. Trump were well aware of the nuances of American policy toward Taiwan.Among hard-line Republicans, there has always been a push to confront China by reaching out to Taiwan. In a statement on Friday, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who was briefly believed to be a candidate for Mr. Trump\u2019s defense secretary, praised him for taking the call, saying it \u201creaffirms our commitment to the only democracy on Chinese soil.\u201dPresident Ronald Reagan antagonized China by inviting a delegation from Taiwan to his inauguration. Aides to President George W. Bush pressed him to take a more confrontational approach with China until the attacks of Sept. 11 reordered his priorities, increasing the need for him to cultivate China on counterterrorism and other issues.Tensions over Taiwan peaked under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who in March 1996 ordered two aircraft carrier battle groups into the Taiwan Strait after China conducted missile tests to intimidate the island.For some China experts, shaking up the cross-strait relationship would not be the worst thing in the world. \u201cWe have had a status quo of sorts in the Taiwan Strait that has kept the peace, but it recently has not looked all that durable, nor was it very agreeable to most citizens of democratic Taiwan,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.\u201cWhether a new kind of Trumpian brinkmanship will now cause China to reconsider its hard-line position towards Taiwan, or to respond in a dangerous and militant way, remains to be seen,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump has spoken harshly about China, accusing it of concocting climate change as a hoax to undercut American manufacturers, branding it a currency manipulator (when it in fact is trying to prop its currency up), and threatening to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers have also advocated punitive responses to what they portray as unfair Chinese actions.A few days after he was elected, however, Mr. Trump spoke with China\u2019s president, Mr. Xi, and released a statement afterward that said the two men had a \u201cclear sense of mutual respect.\u201dTaiwan is also likely to seek a closer relationship with the United States. After years of a Kuomintang government, which pursued closer China ties, Taiwan elected Ms. Tsai as its second president from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Analysts said that Ms. Tsai, though not a firebrand, was seeking to diversify Taiwan\u2019s economic partners and carve out more space for it in international affairs.There are also lingering questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Taiwan. The news media there has reported that the Trump Organization sent a representative to Taiwan to explore building a luxury hotel in a government-backed development near Taipei\u2019s airport, though an official with the Trump Organization said it was not planning any expansion into Taiwan.The Trump Organization does not dispute that one of its employees \u2014 assigned to promote hotel sales related to Asia \u2014 was in Taipei, the capital, in October for a work-related visit. The duties of the executive, Anne-Marie Donoghue, include trying to find guests for the company\u2019s hotels worldwide, and she is not involved in developing new real estate projects for Trump Hotels.For the Chinese government, as for many other governments around the world, Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling diplomacy poses a challenge. At first, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, played down the episode, saying it was a \u201cpetty action by the Taiwan side\u201d that would not upset the longstanding policy of One China.But hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a formal complaint with the Obama administration. It urged the United States to \u201chandle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall U.S.-China relationship.\u201dDavid Shambaugh, the director of the China policy program at George Washington University, said Beijing\u2019s measured response made sense. But he said that if the Trump administration took more concrete steps to change time-tested ways of dealing with Taiwan, \u201cthey can expect additional pushback from China.\u201dReporting was contributed by Eric Lipton from Washington, Maggie Haberman and Megan Twohey from New York, and Michael Forsythe from Taoyuan, Taiwan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Hobbles Through a Cash Crisis, and Electronic Payments Boom", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byMr. Mandal is among millions of Indians \u2014 snack vendors and rickshaw drivers, cobblers and coconut-water sellers \u2014 who are moving swiftly toward a cashless economy, fulfilling what Prime Minister Narendra Modi now says was one of his objectives in banning 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, worth about $7.40 and $14.80.India is experiencing an acute shortage of bills to replace the large-denomination notes that were banned as of Nov. 9, and which made up 86 percent of the country\u2019s currency. There have been numerous reports of people waiting in line for hours at banks or A.T.M.s, only to find that the machines are out of cash.As the public struggles with too few bills in circulation, business has fallen in many sectors to a small fraction of what it was before the ban. Economists warn that India\u2019s growth of 7.3 percent in the most recent quarter, among the fastest of any large economy, could take a hit if the cash shortage continues.\u201cAfter the currency ban, my sales came down sharply,\u201d said Mr. Mandal, who sells dumplings from a handcart in a market in the New Ashok Nagar neighborhood. \u201cProviding change was a big problem.\u201dAfter a customer suggested that he take electronic payments, he downloaded software that allows him to accept such transactions on his phone. Forty percent of his sales are now conducted electronically, he says.Even merchants who do not have smartphones are contemplating buying one. \u201cIf people are flying in planes, how long we can ride on bullock cart?\u201d asked Sunil Jaiswal, who charges less than $2 to repair watches in an alley near Connaught Place.To be effective, the move had to be a closely guarded secret until the last minute, to prevent those holding black money from unloading it before the ban went into effect \u2014 the morning after the decision was announced. As a result, the government did not print enough replacement cash in time for the change, and it continues to struggle to do so fast enough, creating a cash shortage that has strangled large sectors of the economy.But Indians are switching to electronic payments more rapidly than many experts had predicted, and in speaking of the recent currency moves, Mr. Modi has begun emphasizing the benefits of a cashless economy over the anticorruption fight.Across the country, about 70,000 merchants a day are signing up for India\u2019s best-selling mobile payments platform, Paytm, about 14 times as many as the daily average before the currency decision, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm and One97 Communications, the start-up behind it.Since the large-currency ban, the number of daily transactions on Paytm has grown to nearly six million, an increase of 350 percent, and the service is adding half a million users each day, Mr. Sharma said.\u201cEarlier, we were the innovator, now we are the mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the start of the golden age for financial technology companies.\u201dMore than 230 million people in India use electronic wallets, the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said, representing nearly one-fifth of the country\u2019s population.At the same time, the government has tasked banks in the country with adding one million machines in stores to process credit and debit card transactions by March 2017, a two-thirds increase from the 1.5 million available today.The number of credit and debit card machines that have been added since the large-currency ban was put in place is not yet available. But Icici Bank, one of India\u2019s biggest private lenders, says it has detected a sharp increase in demand from merchants processing debit and credit card charges. A spokeswoman for Icici said that the bank had installed six times as many machines last week as it did, on average, before the limit on high-denomination bills.Still, A. P. Hota, managing director and chief executive of the National Payments Corporation of India, an umbrella group for sellers of retail payment systems, said that he was skeptical the government could achieve its goal of adding one million new credit and debit card machines in a few months, calling it \u201ca gigantic task.\u201d The infrastructure is not yet in place to process the paperwork involved and to teach merchants how to use the machines, he said.\u201cA merchant will have several legitimate queries, like how to reconcile the payments, how to get money, if there is a problem, whom to contact,\u201d Mr. Hota said. \u201cThere has to be an infrastructure to handle these queries.\u201dIn part because of increased demand from small and midsize merchants, as well as from government departments, the number of credit and debit card transactions has soared to 10 million a day, more than three times as many as before November, said Deepak Chandnani, managing director for South Asia and the Middle East of Worldline India Private Limited, a division of the French company Atos. Worldline produces about a third of the machines used to process these charges in India.One97, the owner of Paytm, has hired 3,500 employees in the last month, 50 percent more than it had hired in the previous two years, the company\u2019s founder, Mr. Sharma, said. Unable to meet demand from merchants seeking help setting up the systems, the company ran newspaper advertisements with instructions to help business owners do it themselves. The ads also serve as posters for merchants to advertise that they use Paytm.Saurabh Porwal, 31, who sells onions on the roadside in Harola Market in Noida, a city near Delhi, downloaded the Paytm app after seeing the newspaper advertisement, which he then posted on his stall. \u201cIf you deal in less cash, it is less of a problem,\u201d he says.Moving toward a cashless economy would carry benefits for the government, ensuring that more taxes are paid and providing banks with more reserves to extend loans. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent in the United States, a joint study by Google India and Boston Consulting Group found.Still, those adopting cashless technology are a minority. At Janpath Cloth Market in Delhi, where vendors shout out discounted prices to passers-by, only one of more than 100 open-air shops advertised a cashless system.Amit Maheshwari, who sells men\u2019s pants, displays a white piece of paper on his stall saying, in bold type, \u201cPaytm Accepted Here.\u201dAfter the currency change, sales at the shop fell to about 10 percent of what they were before, he said. Then a customer who was browsing said he would buy some pants if he could use Paytm. \u201cWe had no idea what this was,\u201d Mr. Maheshwari said. \u201cHe taught us how to use it.\u201dSince adopting Paytm, sales have risen to 50 percent of what they were before the currency change, he said. \u201cEverybody should use it. Anybody can use it,\u201d he said.But many vendors around India are still resistant. Mustkeem Ahemad, 38, who sells chicken in Harola Market, says that electronic payment systems are too complex for him.\u201cHow can you pay on a phone? Only an educated person can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am illiterate, so I just can\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Approach to Corporate Tax Law Has House G.O.P. Support", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to protect and create American manufacturing jobs, even threatening high tariffs on imports to help achieve that goal. So far, though, his plan seems to lean heavily on one-at-a-time deals, like the one struck late last month to save jobs at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis.\u201cIt would be the biggest change in business tax law ever in the United States,\u201d said Martin A. Sullivan, the chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit tax research organization and publisher. \u201cIt might actually work, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a partisan issue.\u201dA central idea is that goods would be taxed based on where they were consumed rather than where they were produced, meaning that imports would be taxed by Washington while exports would not. Tax experts call this a destination-based consumption tax.This would be a sharp departure for the United States in a number of ways, but taxing imports but not exports is in step with nearly all of America\u2019s trading partners, which have so-called value-added taxes. The import-and-export tax treatment is known as border adjustment.The proposed overhaul would have other changes. The cost of capital investments would be deducted immediately rather than depreciated over years, but interest costs would no longer be deductible.The package of ideas has evolved over years, mainly in academic circles. Its principal intellectual champion in the United States is Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Auerbach\u2019s goal, he said, is to transform the economics of the corporate tax system so that \u201cincentives will align with the national interest.\u201dThe destination-based concept, according to Mr. Auerbach, is an adaptation to the modern economy of open borders and advancing technology. Much business value is now in intellectual property like patents and software.Multinationals are adept at shifting these intangible assets to low-tax nations as a way to shelter profits and avoid taxes. A destination-based system, focusing on where a product is consumed, would be much simplified, eliminating incentives to game the system, Mr. Auerbach said.By not taxing exports, he said, it would \u201cstrongly encourage American companies to locate activities in the United States.\u201dBut critics say this is wishful thinking, divorced from the reality of international trade laws, Washington lobbying and corporate financial engineering. Major features of Mr. Auerbach\u2019s design, they say, will probably be jettisoned to appease domestic interests or conform to trade rules. A new system might curb some tax gaming, they say, but not stop it.What will remain, they predict, will be the House proposal to sharply reduce the corporate tax rate. \u201cThe result will be a giant corporate tax cut that benefits the rich because most of the owners are rich,\u201d said Robert McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice. \u201cEveryone loses except those at the top.\u201dMr. Auerbach, 65, became fascinated by the mechanics and impact of tax policy while pursuing his doctorate at Harvard, encouraged by his thesis adviser, Martin Feldstein, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration.Mr. Auerbach was an adviser to John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president in 2004. But Mr. Auerbach has long been a registered independent. \u201cI like to keep conversations open with both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cI think of myself as an economist first, and that the evidence should dictate the policy.\u201dHis research on tax policy has increasingly focused on the global context. So has the study of other economists. In 2001, in a conference at Berkeley, Michael Devereux was the co-author of a paper with Stephen R. Bond that introduced the term destination-based corporate tax.In recent years, Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Devereux have cooperated in developing the idea and working through how it might be put into effect. \u201cWe\u2019re kindred spirits, for sure,\u201d said Mr. Devereux, a professor at the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford.For years, Mr. Auerbach has been making that case on trips to Washington. There has been some interest at times. In 2005, a bipartisan presidential advisory panel on tax reform included his idea as one option, but it went nowhere.But the real political endorsement came this year, when Representative Kevin Brady, a conservative Texas Republican and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced corporate tax overhaul proposals. His blueprint includes most of Mr. Auerbach\u2019s recommendations. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now vows to pursue tax legislation that would cut both business and personal taxes.Mr. Brady\u2019s plan calls for lowering the corporate tax to 20 percent, from 35 percent. Mr. Auerbach, who has met with Mr. Brady, did not advocate a specific rate, but he said 20 percent was a \u201csolid rate that is often discussed.\u201d (Mr. Trump has proposed lowering the corporate rate to 15 percent.)In an interview, Mr. Brady said a destination-based system would \u201clevel the playing field for made-in-America products.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt removes all the incentives to move jobs, research and headquarters overseas.\u201dMr. Brady and his staff have met with Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the Trump team will want to work with us,\u201d he said.But they may not agree with the entire House package. Eliminating interest deductions would hurt businesses that rely heavily on debt financing, like real estate developers and Wall Street financiers, many of whom have been Trump backers.And the plan is already stirring resistance elsewhere, dividing business interests even more than experts who split along ideological lines.Companies that import goods or import a large portion of the parts and materials that go into their products will most likely be worse off, at least initially.Many retailers fall into that camp. David French, the senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said his group, while still studying the plan, considered it \u201can exotic economics lab experiment.\u201d Retailers, he added, were \u201cvery concerned about practical effect of this on profits, jobs and operations.\u201dMr. Auerbach said the retailers\u2019 worries were misplaced. If, in the short term, exports rise and imports fall, the value of the dollar should increase in step with the higher demand for dollars. Retailers, he said, will \u201cmake up in a stronger dollar what they lose in higher tax payments.\u201dMr. French, of the retail trade group, is unconvinced, saying it would be a risky bet to be making with the nation\u2019s $2.6 trillion retail industry.At the National Association of Manufacturers, which counts 14,000 members from corporations and private companies, Dorothy Coleman, the vice president for tax and domestic economic policy, called the initial Brady plan a \u201cthoughtful attempt to break out of the gridlock\u201d on tax simplification in recent years.But even some manufacturers have concerns. Last week, Koch Industries, a private industrial corporation run by Charles G. and David H. Koch, prominent Republican supporters, said the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d provision of the House plan could be \u201cdevastating\u201d to the economy. In a statement, the company said it would \u201cgreatly benefit\u201d in the short term as a large exporter, but warned that the American economy would suffer from less free trade and higher consumer prices.Mr. Auerbach\u2019s approach, embraced by the Brady proposal, will also face a hurdle at the World Trade Organization. Among its provisions is to allow American companies to deduct domestic wages from taxation, which makes it less costly to employ workers and helps them offset the higher price of imported goods. A wage deduction is not currently permitted under W.T.O. rules, and is likely to be seen as an unfair subsidy to American companies and a trade barrier.But Mr. Auerbach replies that his system is the \u201ceconomic equivalent\u201d of policies that comply with W.T.O. rules \u2014 a value-added tax that is border-adjusted, combined with a reduction in payroll taxes and lowering income taxes.Michael Graetz, a tax expert at the Columbia Law School, said he doubted that argument would prevail in Geneva. \u201cW.T.O. lawyers do not take the view that things that look the same economically are acceptable,\u201d Mr. Graetz said. \u201cThey don\u2019t behave the way Alan might like.\u201d\u201cEconomists don\u2019t rule the world; I understand that,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. \u201cYou never know when or if your policy ideas will have an impact.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information supplied by an executive at the National Association of Manufacturers, misstated the number of members in the association. It is 14,000, not 12,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Even a Prosperous Slovakia Is Immune to Doubts About the E.U.", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byNow 46, Mr. Hirjak has a wood products company and just bought a small sawmill in Gabcikovo. He has benefited from the bloc\u2019s free movement of travel, goods and labor.\u201cYoung people who are clever can travel and work abroad, and come back or not, and as for the economy, we can export,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t survive otherwise.\u201dHe ought to be a cheerleader for the European Union, but he is ambivalent at best. And his ambivalence speaks to a fundamental and growing problem for the union. Even in countries that have prospered, public sentiment is steadily shifting against Brussels.The relatively moderate Slovaks are hardly immune from the right-wing, nationalist and populist forces threatening to unravel the European Union. Slovakia is one of the four so-called Visegrad countries, along with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Slovaks are showing the same doubts about the future of Europe as the others, and showing some of the same vulnerabilities to right-wing nationalism \u2014 and Moscow\u2019s siren song.Over schnitzel, pilsner and cherry compote, Mr. Hirjak talked about how he was troubled by the migrant crisis and aid to richer countries in the eurozone, like Greece. Slovaks are trying to adjust to the risks of capitalism, \u201cbut now the E.U. is trying to do something in between,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to support countries that are lazy, like Greece. Why should we take care of them? We\u2019re poor, a lot poorer than they are.\u201dHis colleague Ivan Feik, 47, said that \u201cwith Europe so divided, it\u2019s complicated. Everyone wants something different. Everyone thinks how best to survive and looks only at what the E.U. can offer them.\u201dAs for the refugees, Mr. Feik said: \u201cMuslims are a big unknown to us, so people are more worried. As long as the refugees are Christian, it\u2019s no problem.\u201d Diversity in Europe can work over time \u201cwith proper management and regulations,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it can go wrong with too many different kinds of people. If we\u2019re not careful, with all the divisions, we\u2019ll end up with nothing.\u201dThe government decided to use a rundown technical school to temporarily house migrants seeking asylum in Austria as they poured in from Hungary, which took a tough line against them. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, visited a year ago to urge compassion, but that was, and remains, in short supply.Slovakia, like other Visegrad countries, rejected the demands of Brussels to take even a small quota of refugees, breaking a traditional consensus of solidarity among member states of the European Union.\u201cThe European Union is asking too much from us,\u201d said Albina Schweigerova, 59, a pharmaceutical worker. \u201cThey should better help those here who need it, and not the outsiders,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the refugees here; they take our money but don\u2019t share our values.\u201dOn the surface, the Slovaks should be content. Since joining the European Union more than 12 years ago, Slovakia now produces more cars per capita than any country in the world, uses the euro and receives the most European Union development aid per capita. Almost 10 percent of its labor force works in other union countries, and its businesses export freely throughout the bloc. As such, Slovakia is an ideal testing ground for the developing disaffection toward Brussels and liberal elites. If those attitudes can grow and fester there, analysts say, then no country is immune.The issues tearing at Europe are well documented: Chronically low growth; an influx of migrants; Britain\u2019s vote to leave the bloc; the growing strength of anti-European Union parties; and continuing meddling from a resurgent, revanchist Russia, which seeks to undermine confidence in both NATO and the European Union.\u201cWhen we joined the European Union and later the euro, everything was great,\u201d said Milan Nic, research director of Globsec, a policy research institute in Bratislava. \u201cBut now our confidence is shaken. The E.U. is seen as not delivering, as incomprehensible, from a different era, not from today.\u201dThe party is anti-immigrant, anti-Brussels, anti-NATO and anti-Roma, and in the March elections it won 14 seats in Parliament, largely in poorer, more rural areas. Mr. Kotleba, who has been trying to edge away from his past neo-Nazi ties, started a campaign for a referendum on membership in both NATO and the European Union, although it is considered unlikely to get the 350,000 signatures required, despite support from pro-Russian websites.\u201cFico is a nationalist populist now, more anti-U.S. and pro-Russia, playing off Brussels,\u201d said Miroslav Beblavy, 39, an opposition member of Parliament. \u201cFico will not let himself be outflanked by the populists.\u201d\u201cWe signed up for European values of liberal democracy, rule of law, transparency and the upholding of human rights, but we did not internalize them,\u201d Mr. Milo said. \u201cThey are still seen as something foreign or alien to our national character.\u201dSlovakia and the Czech Republic are \u201cmoving in the same direction as Poland and Hungary,\u201d he said. Russia, Mr. Milo added, \u201cis very good at playing on these sentiments in this whole region.\u201dFor those \u201cdisquieted by this liberal world,\u201d Mr. Beblavy said, \u201cRussia is seen as the only bulwark of traditional values.\u201dOlga Gyarfasova, a sociologist at Comenius University and the Institute for Public Affairs, said that about 200,000 Slovaks, as much as 10 percent of the labor force, are working in other European Union countries, and that Eurobarometer opinion polls show that a small majority of Slovaks still consider membership a \u201cgood thing,\u201d but that only 30 percent feel the same about NATO.The fall in support has been rapid. While 68 percent of Slovaks backed membership in union in 2010, the figure in February was only 52 percent. While 14 percent are against it, 30 percent think membership is neither good nor bad.\u201cThe problem is that the E.U. is only understood to be delivering benefits, not as sharing common problems,\u201d Ms. Gyarfasova said. \u201cOur Visegrad politicians take all the credit for the benefits of the E.U. and blame all their problems on Brussels.\u201dIn Europe as a whole, \u201cthere is something fundamental happening to representative democracy as we\u2019ve known it for a century,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is the hollowing out and backsliding of democracy, and trust toward democratic institutions is eroding.\u201dThe young, as ever, are more optimistic and still largely pro-European. At the train station in Bratislava, the capital, Lukas Varga, 19, said he wanted to travel and study abroad. \u201cThough I disagree with some things the E.U. does, I want to stay in,\u201d he said.His friend Veronika Kvarkova, 18, wants to become a business executive. \u201cNow I can travel, study, learn English, use the same currency,\u201d she said.But the obligations of the bloc are troubling, even to them. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept everyone from the Middle East but we should help,\u201d Mr. Varga said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only people fleeing war, fine, but then they should go home again.\u201dThomas Funtik, 20, an economics student in Brno, said that \u201ccountries like Slovakia need the European Union more than Britain does. We need it to work and for our companies to expand.\u201dBut he and others oppose aid to Greece. \u201cWe should help with better investments and not just give them fat pensions,\u201d Mr. Funtik said.An article on Dec. 17 about ambivalence toward the European Union even in countries that have prospered under the bloc, like Slovakia, misstated the number of seats in Parliament that the People\u2019s Party-Our Slovakia won in March. The party won 14 seats, not 13.Miroslava Germanova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Donald J. Trump Could Promote Long-Term Economic Growth", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewDespite hand-wringing before the election that a Trump presidency would presage near-term and long-term calamity, giddy equity markets responded to a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress with a more sanguine view. Such a response makes sense if a pro-growth policy is indeed much more likely, but it also lays bare steps the new administration and its economic team need to take to justify that optimism.While there are many issues on the new team\u2019s economic plate, one should take precedence over the others: restarting economic growth.Business people and households need to believe that faster sustained growth is possible. Structural problems \u2014 exacerbated by public policies of the past several years and a stimulus mind-set \u2014 have fed pessimism, restraining investment in capital and people.Now, expectations can be reset through the core elements of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s economic plan, if they are coordinated, implemented and explained well. Here is what\u2019s needed:Two building blocks to raise productivity are tax reform and regulatory reform. Tax reform can raise investment and productivity by significantly reducing marginal tax rates on business income, while broadening the tax base. There is no arrow in the policy quiver that dominates fundamental tax reform in raising incomes \u2014 economists estimate gains as large as a 0.5 percentage-point increase in economic growth annually for a decade. These gains come principally from raising investment in the United States and reducing wasteful tax distortions of business planning. Regulatory reform is a second building block for growth by weakening impediments to investment in energy and utilities, while overhauling financial regulation to improve credit availability for small and midsize firms.Work is vital for growth, incomes and social dignity. Tax reform is a core element here, too \u2014 raising returns to work by reducing tax rates on incremental earnings. But broader support for work is needed economically, and its absence figured in the understandable economic anxiety during the campaign.These additional building blocks provide this broader support for work. First, market-based health care reforms \u2014 widely analyzed before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s more regulatory approach \u2014 can slow the rate of growth of health care costs. This slowing is important, as it permits compensation to workers to shift toward wages, raising incomes.Second, we should strengthen substantially the earned-income tax credit for childless workers to encourage and support entry-level work and the earnings-building skills that work provides.Third, current spending on unwieldy federal job training programs can be directed toward personal re-employment accounts for income support and enhanced personalized training for individuals who are most likely to experience long-lasting unemployment given economic dislocations from technological change or domestic or foreign competition.A substantial federal infrastructure spending program can support the building blocks of pro-growth policy in raising expectations. But to do so, it needs three elements. First, it should be a long-term commitment. There are few shovel-ready projects available for stimulus. A long-term commitment raises business people\u2019s expectations of future demand and increased labor demand. Second, an infrastructure program should be a partnership, bankrolled by federal, state, local and also private funds, with the mix depending on the project. And regulations should be streamlined to reduce costs and increase the speed of new construction.To the extent that part of the federal financing of an infrastructure program is linked to corporate tax changes, the program needs to be ready to accompany tax reform. Otherwise, especially given that program design is complex, infrastructure could follow tax reform in the pro-growth policy change.While constructive in its early strong response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has been depended upon too much by a government not willing to tackle bold reforms. The continuing hyper-accommodative monetary policy in the more normal current economic environment misallocates credit, punishes savers and favors financial engineering over productivity-enhancing real investment.Early equity market gains after Mr. Trump\u2019s election offer a vote of optimism in the potential impact of a different economic policy direction.Now, the right building blocks, action and communication can sustain that optimism and generate higher incomes and greater opportunity.R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Google\u2019s Renewable Cloud", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byBitsThe next cat video you play on YouTube may help the green energy industry.To be clear, Google, which owns YouTube, will not be only consuming renewables: Its massive data centers are on big electric grids, which take power from a number of sources, including coal. Google arranges to have renewable sources on those grids, so that its net consumption isn\u2019t drawing down additional carbon-based power.In fact, in many cases it is buying more wind and solar power than it uses, because Google is still having a hard time developing those sources in Asia. As a result, it overprovisions in places like North America and Europe, where there are more wind turbines.This is a big deal for a couple of reasons. For one, most of the growth in industrial power consumption is from data centers, and Google, along with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, is building global cloud computing centers at an unprecedented clip.Some of the companies have been hit by environmentalists for not being green, and now all three companies are trying to be better corporate citizens, in terms of their consumption.Google also makes much of its efficient power usage inside its data centers. For this story, I went to Oklahoma, where a 50,000-acre wind farm generates power for the same grid where Google operates its second-largest computer complex in North America, a plot of eight large buildings not far from the Arkansas border.Inside the facility, Google has a lot of clever ways to reuse water, and bring outside air to cool its computer servers. In terms of power usage effectiveness, Google\u2019s computing plant uses almost all the power it takes in to run its machines \u2014 not long ago, computer centers used just half the power they brought in.Individual machines typically waste 30 percent of the power they take; Google\u2019s computers waste 10 percent to 15 percent.Google may be trying to give the planet one big green hug here, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t also looking out for the main chance. The green announcement is good public relations, and may spur other big companies to use more wind and solar. The industry is young enough that it\u2019s still finding economies of scale, so more consumers could lower Google\u2019s future acquisition costs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Smaller Bathrooms on Planes Pose Challenges for Passengers", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byUpdateSmaller lavatories are helping airlines to add extra seats to new and existing aircraft for more profit, but some passengers \u2014 if they can get into the bathrooms \u2014 say they are being shortchanged.The continuing installation of smaller and reconfigured bathrooms, which began in late 2013, has led to complaints about safety issues, say travelers and flight crew, who are concerned about restricted access for the physically disabled, as well as ease of use for other passengersBarry Brandes, a retired singer from Somers, N.Y., travels several times a year on United Airlines. At 6-foot-4, Mr. Brandes said that getting into the new lavatories on the Boeing 737-900, a single-aisle airplane, is not easy. \u201cIf I don\u2019t duck, I hit my head on the door,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand up completely, so I have to twist myself into a pretzel to use the facility.\u201dUnited has a total of 250 Boeing 737-800 and 737-900 aircraft that feature a combination of the new lavatory and the traditional lavatory, according to Erin Benson, a spokeswoman. In an email, she said the airplanes are reconfigured for the best use of space. In some aircraft, she noted, lavatories in first class have a new design, but have not decreased in size, while new lavatories located between first class and the first row of economy have decreased in size.The configuration of the toilets can make it especially difficult during medical emergencies to help travelers who are incapacitated or unable to move on their own, said Jeffrey A. Tonjes, a spokesman for United flight attendants in the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, a union that represents 50,000 flight attendants at 18 airlines.\u201cBoth passenger and flight attendant are in harm\u2019s way for injury or slowed response if we have difficulty getting to the passenger,\u201d Mr. Tonjes said. \u201cUnited Airlines is aware of this, and committed to addressing the issue about a year ago, but has been slow in getting the fix done.\u201dThe square footage of the old and new bathrooms varies, depending on their location \u2014 whether they are in the back next to the galley, on the sides of the plane in front of the galley, mid-cabin in coach or in first class \u2014 and the model of aircraft.This reporter recently measured the lavatories on a Boeing 757-300, which had the traditional, older bathrooms, and on a 737-800, which had the newer bathrooms.The traditional lavatories in first class and coach on a Boeing 757-300 measured, 41 inches long by 34\u00bd inches wide by 75 inches high. On a Boeing 737-800, the new bathroom in first class measured 36 by 27 by 77, and in coach measured 39\u00be by 24\u00bd by 77. The new lavatories, which had smaller sinks and trash receptacles, were a bit taller than the traditional bathrooms, but narrower and less deep.Ms. Benson, who declined to give official dimensions, said only that the newer bathrooms shrank three to four inches from the sink to the opposite wall, and lengthened two to three inches from the back of the toilet to the door.The smaller bathrooms, combined with smaller galleys and trimmer seats with less pitch, allow space for an extra row of seats in the rear.Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said that airlines choose their own lavatory, galley and seat arrangements from various suppliers to create optimal use of cabin space. He declined to reveal lavatory dimensions and added, in an email, that \u201cthere is currently only one supplier for lavs across all models of the 737 \u2014 B/E Aerospace.\u201dNumerous phone calls requesting an interview with executives from B/E Aerospace, which has its headquarters in Wellington, Fla., were not returned.Ms. Benson of United declined to comment on complaints about the smaller bathrooms and referred questions to Airlines for America, a trade group that represents major United States airlines. Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for the group, wrote in an email: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of issues or complaints on the matter.\u201dUnited is not the only airline to install smaller lavatories on its newer single-aisle aircraft. Bobbie Egan, an Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, said six of its airline\u2019s 153 Boeing 737s have lavatories that were slightly reduced in size, and that no customer complaints have been registered. \u201cSeparately, adjusting [the seat] pitch and removing a mid-cabin lavatory and closet on these six planes enabled us to add one row of seats,\u201d Ms. Egan wrote in an email.Delta Air Lines flies the Boeing 737-900ER, which all have the smaller lavatories, and Airbus 320s, which are undergoing cabin modification. \u201cA small number of the A320s now have the smaller lavs,\u201d said Morgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta. He said that in customer surveys, there has been no significant feedback or complaints about the size of the lavatories, and no reports of related injuries.Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, has a different perspective.\u201cThe concerns are uniform across the industry,\u201d said Ms. Nelson, who added that AFA-CWA does not represent Delta flight attendants, who are not unionized. Describing facing lavatories, she said that \u201cthe doors of these restrooms open into each other, creating safety issues. There are a lot of injuries, with smashed fingers, doors hitting people, bumps and bruises.\u201dMs. Nelson said that the rear cabin restroom doors also create a barricade between the cabin and the back galley when open, limiting the ability of crew to maneuver if a passenger in the cabin is in trouble.Some parents with small children say they cannot help their kids in the toilet unless the door stays open. Passengers of size, and those with physical challenges, say getting into the smaller lavatories is often not possible for them.Jake Fitzpatrick, who is in the process of introducing a start-up that reviews travel accommodations for the physically challenged, has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, which requires a caregiver\u2019s help in order to use the restroom.When he takes Delta and Alaska Airlines, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, it\u2019s impossible for him to get into their single-aisle-aircraft bathrooms, so he uses restrooms at the airport before boarding.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hold it, even for three to four hours,\u201d said Mr. Fitzpatrick, who lives in Portland, Ore. \u201cIf I go before, it takes 30 to 45 minutes to board everybody, and when we land, we often have to wait for a gate. A three- to four-hour flight means someone with a disability might have to wait five to six hours to go to the bathroom.\u201dDepartment of Transportation rules require at least one accessible lavatory on twin-aisle aircraft, but do not require accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft like the Boeing 737-900 or Airbus 320, which are used for many short- to medium-range flights.Caitlin Harvey, a spokeswoman for the department, wrote in an email that the department has not received a significant number of written complaints from passengers with disabilities about the size of bathrooms on single-aisle aircraft.However, she said, disability rights advocates have consistently raised the issue, advocating a rule requiring airlines to provide an accessible lavatory on single-aisle aircraft. So the department has formed the Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transportation, which comprises industry representatives, disability rights advocates and other experts, to look into it.\u201cThe committee is studying a range of promising design and layout solutions, both with respect to the lavatories themselves and with respect to onboard wheelchair design, that may be implemented in the short-term, medium-term and long-term,\u201d Ms. Harvey wrote in an email. \u201cThe committee is also studying the costs and trade-offs that may come with imposing any new accessibility standards.\u201dSuch changes can\u2019t come soon enough for travelers like Wilma Abbey, a retired teacher from the Nashville area, whose two hip replacements have made maneuvering in airplane bathrooms very difficult.\u201cJust wait until someone gets stuck in one of those bathrooms, causing an emergency landing, and the airline gets sued,\u201d Ms. Abbey said. \u201cHow much money do the airlines have to make before they provide the basic necessities? I\u2019d like to see airline executives sit in coach and use the bathrooms they\u2019ve provided us. It\u2019s just an insult to the customers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tell Investors of Climate Risks, Energy Sector Is Urged", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byA coalition of the world\u2019s most powerful bankers, regulators and even executives at some heavy polluters have a message for oil and gas companies: Be more forthcoming about the risks posed by climate change.The new guidelines, issued on Wednesday by a task force commissioned by the Group of 20 richest nations, are some of the most comprehensive about how companies should measure and disclose the predicted effects of extreme weather and rising seas. These recommendations come at a tough time for climate advocates, still reeling from the prospect of a presidential administration in the United States hostile to steps to address climate change.With little prospect for new rule making in the United States and slow progress elsewhere, the task force urged corporations to disclose climate risks voluntarily.The guidelines follow a stark warning last year by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, who said oil companies risked setting off a financial crisis because of their blindness to climate risks.If the world seriously intended to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, he said, most of Earth\u2019s coal, oil and gas reserves would need to remain in the ground, rendering a substantial bulk of those assets worthless. Add to that other global corporations that will face growing losses from flooding, drought and other severe effects of climate change in the coming years, he said, and there was the real danger of a systemic shock to the world economy.Mr. Carney\u2019s warnings, the gravest to come from a top financial official, prompted Group of 20 to commission global guidelines on how corporations should disclose climate-related risks. And the resulting recommendations have some powerful backers.The guidelines remain voluntary, however, and are unlikely to be readily adopted by the oil and gas companies that they most target. Critics say that volatile oil prices and uncertainty over what regulators might do make predicting the value of oil reserves extremely tricky.The 2-degree scenario laid out in Paris has come under doubt amid fears the incoming Donald J. Trump administration will renege on commitments and dismantle other climate-friendly policies. Mr. Trump has appointed fossil fuel advocates to crucial posts in his office, including Myron Ebell, a climate change skeptic, to lead the transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.Still, the recommendations speak to a broader public concern over climate change risks to companies.Activist shareholders have increasingly pressured corporations to disclose climate-related risks, with some early victories. The fossil fuel companies Shell and BHP Billiton have released studies of the impact a 2-degree warming situation would have on their sprawling operations.The stakes are high, according to recent estimates. Under a scenario that would limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, oil company revenue could fall by more than $22 trillion over the next 25 years, Barclays predicted last year.An article on Thursday about a task force\u2019s efforts to urge corporations to disclose climate risks voluntarily misstated the role of Myron Ebell. He is leading the president-elect\u2019s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency; he was not nominated to lead the agency itself.

{"Headline": "The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk.The F.B.I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the government\u2019s best-protected networks.Yared Tamene, the tech-support contractor at the D.N.C. who fielded the call, was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for \u201cthe Dukes\u201d and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks \u2014 in part because he wasn\u2019t certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.\u201cI had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo, obtained by The New York Times, that detailed his contact with the F.B.I.It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and information-warfare campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.Like another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee\u2019s old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.An examination by The Times of the Russian operation \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack, intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response \u2014 reveals a series of missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack.The D.N.C.\u2019s fumbling encounter with the F.B.I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House\u2019s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.The low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, whose private email account was hacked months later.By last summer, Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day \u2014 procured by Russian intelligence agents, posted on WikiLeaks and other websites, then eagerly reported on by the American media, including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail.In recent days, a skeptical president-elect, the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election.Many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election, while conceding that other factors \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses as a candidate; her private email server; the public statements of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about her handling of classified information \u2014 were also important.While there\u2019s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A low-cost, high-impact weapon that Russia had test-fired in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States, with devastating effectiveness. For Russia, with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of all-out war, cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap, hard to see coming, hard to trace.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d\u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201dThe United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201dMr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn.\u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed.\u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201dSitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture.Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again.There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have.\u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said.The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show.\u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201dPart of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201dMr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised.Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.\u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d\u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201dThe F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201dBy March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn.A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button.With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C.The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated.One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead.Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world.But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it.The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia.But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.\u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dSo the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld.Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call.With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers.\u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d\u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201dMr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them.\u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201dThe work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer.It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.\u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email.Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak.All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201dThe D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.\u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201dIt was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201dBut online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.\u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201dThat gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201dThat was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201dThe Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d\u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201dBut asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201dThough Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web.\u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201dInside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea.In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim.But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president.\u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.\u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201dEven something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky.\u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201dInstead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.\u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201dBut Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters.But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role.But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201dLater, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.\u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded.Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201dA covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201dThe Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive.Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump?In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals.One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper. Its title: \u201cWhy American Elections Are Flawed.\u201dEditors\u2019 Note: An earlier version of the main photograph with this article, of a filing cabinet and computer at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, should not have been published. The photographer had removed a framed image from the wall over the filing cabinet \u2014 showing a Washington Post Watergate front page \u2014 because it was causing glare with the lighting. The new version shows the scene as it normally appears, with the framed newspaper page in place.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Responsible When Extremists Get a Platform?", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIf these discussions were about litigating the past, their operating definition of what a platform is and does seemed to be stuck in the past as well. In computing, the word carries a different meaning. A platform is a system that enables other systems: A machine provides a platform for software; the software provides a platform for other software; that software might provide a platform for yet more software; and so on. The iPhone platform lets outside parties build and market apps like Uber; the Uber platform lets outside parties sign up to drive other Uber users for money.Somewhere between media and social media \u2014 between familiar ideas about politics and the news and the ones that underpin the world we live in today \u2014 platforms changed from responsibilities into abdications of responsibility. Claiming to provide a platform, in Silicon Valley, doesn\u2019t demand defense. It is the defense. Platforms don\u2019t cause problems; people do.The closest thing the new world of platforms has to a foundational text is a business book called \u201cInvisible Engines,\u201d published in 2006, which examined and tried to define a nascent form of business: one that doesn\u2019t just sell a good or service, but instead creates value by spawning entire ecosystems and economies. Nintendo and Sega, for example, allowed game developers to create and sell games that ran on their machines; smartphones let software companies connect with customers through app stores; eBay connects merchants and sellers, creating transactions but selling nothing itself. The book makes the prescient case that platforms will come to redefine our economy.\u201cThe platform\u2019s value is not necessarily what it does,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and one of the book\u2019s authors, \u201cbut what it enables.\u201d And what it enables can be enormous. It would be difficult to overstate the zeal that exists for platform companies in Silicon Valley. They represent staggering opportunities, the chance to create or remake entire industries and to preside over them indefinitely, with maximum control and minimum participation or liability. Airbnb has created a marketplace that overlaps substantially with the hotel business, but the properties it rents to users are owned by other users. (The company recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging a New York law that could result in fines against Airbnb for illegally listed properties; it agreed to drop the suit on the condition that fines be levied only against people listing property, not the company itself.) Uber created a sort of marketplace for transportation but doesn\u2019t own its vehicles nor \u2014 it claims, over and over, in courts all across the globe \u2014 does it employ its drivers.But the platform economies that are most developed and that have captured the most people \u2014 the ones that transact on attention, advertising and communication \u2014 are not immediately recognizable to their users as marketplaces. Facebook is not primarily understood among its billion and a half users as an attention brokerage, but that\u2019s exactly what it is: a middleman between users and other users; between advertisers and users; between developers and users; between publishers and advertisers and their viewers and readers.Participants successfully contribute to the broader marketplace by inducing other participants to engage more; beyond shares and followers, success is rewarded off-platform, with the conversion of attention into relationships, into advertising on websites, into sales or into influence and political power. Social platforms are the most extreme and advanced expression of what may be the defining corporate strategy of our time.And so it\u2019s valuable to listen to how they talk about themselves. In a comment under his post about the election, Zuckerberg reiterated, with force, what he sees as the nature of Facebook. \u201cI find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\u201d he wrote, explaining that the company also works on aerospace technology and business software. It\u2019s a platform that aspires to \u201cconnect the world\u201d but that must not be credited with changing it in the process.This line of thinking could not feel more distant from some of the alarming experiences social-media platforms foster. Reddit users terrorized by the openly bigoted and aggressive communities that have congregated there are not comforted by an appeal to economic principles. The virtues of an open platform are lost on the victim of a spontaneous Twitter mob, inspired anonymously or, as the case may be, by the president-elect of the United States. Understanding that the widespread belief in disinformation may have been an unforeseen externality of Facebook\u2019s design is more interesting than helpful, especially as Facebook says it will look to the wisdom of the crowd for solutions to its problems.In seeking and depending on minimum liability, platforms leave gaping voids. For an example of how such a void can be filled, and exploited, look no further than the Breitbart of the 2016 election. It is a site that frequently flaunts its success on social-media platforms and appears amenable to the prevailing winds of change. \u201cBreitbart Ranked #1 for Most Shared Facebook Content on Presidential Debate Day,\u201d read one headline. \u201cMedia Firms Lose Control of News as Tech Platforms Rise,\u201d read another from June. Another story from August begins, \u201cBreitbart News has jumped to the 11th biggest presence on Facebook in terms of total engagements for the month of July,\u201d a ranking of likes, shares and comments that placed the site between The Times and The Washington Post.The site is also keenly aware of its dependence on social media, so attempts made by these platforms to regulate participants or to ban or discourage hateful behavior are covered by Breitbart as conspiracies or assaults on freedom. The site wrote aggressively about frail allegations that Facebook had censored conservative content in its trending-topic module. (Facebook subsequently fired the team responsible for moderating it.) It describes attempts at Twitter moderation as censorship and has characterized the company\u2019s recent account bans as a \u201cpurge.\u201dMany media companies mistakenly imagine Facebook is some sort of partner \u2014 a larger entity that exists on the same spectrum. But Breitbart behaves as though it knows this isn\u2019t true. In practice, it has embraced its role as a platform citizen, one more subservient content peddler among many. In this sense, Breitbart couldn\u2019t have been the platform for the alt-right online. That title would belong to Reddit, to Twitter, to Facebook or to Google, if ever they wanted to claim it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now That Italy Has Rejected Constitutional Amendments, What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byProponents of the changes, including Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, said they would streamline Italy\u2019s cumbersome legislative process by eliminating two-thirds of the Senate and stripping regions of power over crucial issues like transportation, energy and infrastructure.Critics, which included populist groups, said the proposals would have concentrated too much power in the hands of government.The vote was widely considered a referendum on Mr. Renzi\u2019s nearly three-year-old government, although some voters were genuinely displeased with the proposed changes.The most contentious proposal deals with changes to the Senate, which would have become a mostly consultative body consisting of regional and municipal officials.But many constitutional experts wanted to preserve the existing authority of the Senate as a check on the government.The prime minister\u2019s resignation was necessary because he had staked his political future on the referendum. He repeatedly stated that he was in politics to affect change, not to \u201ckeep a chair warm.\u201d When the changes he wanted were rejected, he kept his promise to quit.Mr. Renzi may be leaving the political arena, but Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, predicted that he would not be absent for long.\u201cDefeat for Renzi does not mean defeat in the long term,\u201d he said, noting that those who backed the referendum changes \u2014 about 40 percent of voters \u2014 formed what he described as a \u201cparty of the nation,\u201d which backed Mr. Renzi, who nonetheless faces a fight to maintain control of the Democratic Party.\u201cIt is a movement with a clear leader, a clear program and a clear European outlook,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. The opponents of the changes, on the other hand, were a motley array of parties and movements that shared a sovereign, Euroskeptic and anti-globalization vision, but perhaps little else.\u201cApparently Mr. Renzi lost the battle, but the war is still to be fought,\u201d he said.In the short term, the budget must be passed and the electoral law must be modified or completely overhauled. Mr. Mattarella might appoint a caretaker government to remain in power until elections in the spring. Or he might try to negotiate a longer-term solution, with elections in 2018, when the legislature is scheduled to end.Antonio Polito, deputy director of the Milan-based daily Corriere della Sera, said three people are in position to head a caretaker government: Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister (\u201cwidely respected in Europe\u201d); Pietro Grasso, Senate president (an institutional choice); and Dario Franceschini, culture minister (a Democratic Party heavyweight).Yes, because Italy\u2019s electoral law, the so-called Italicum, which was approved in 2015, is under review by the constitutional court.The law calls for a two-round system, which gives the winning party a majority bonus, but the law applies only to the Lower House, and not to the Senate (which the referendum was supposed to partly eliminate).The law gives the winning party a significant majority, meaning that barring internal tussles, the winning party could rule for an entire five-year term, which is unusual in Italy.As a result, many parties oppose the law. The populist Five Star Movement was among them, but it now wants the law to stand because it is performing strongly in the polls.The \u201cNo\u201d vote has opened a period of economic and political uncertainty in Italy and in Europe, each feeding into the other.Financially, although the markets were relatively calm on Monday, there is concern about the long-term economic consequences of the referendum.The Five Star Movement has pledged to carry out a referendum on whether Italy should remain in the eurozone if it comes to power, potentially undermining the single currency\u2019s stability and that of the wider European Union.Now that Mr. Renzi is leaving, financial analysts worry that the bank rescue efforts will collapse. That would turn away desperately needed private investors and lead to a renewed and possibly contagious financial crisis in Europe, where banks and financial institutions continually lend money to one another.Troubles in the banking sector weigh heavily on the wider Italian economy and could create a vicious circle if economic stagnation continues.If more businesses and consumers struggle to pay their debts, the number of bad loans could rise further and make it even more difficult for banks to provide the credit businesses need to expand or invest.The market interest rate, or yield, on Italian 10-year government bonds has nearly doubled since August, to more than 2 percent, a sign that investors are worried and consider the bonds to be increasingly risky.Populist forces in Italy share a common anti-European sentiment with their continental counterparts, but they are more heterogeneous and have a longer history than elsewhere in Europe.The Northern League has been riding the populist wave for more than two decades on a right-wing, anti-immigration and protectionist platform.The Five Star Movement, which recently won mayoral elections in Rome and Turin, is an internet-based group that draws support from a much broader political spectrum.It aims to sweep away Italy\u2019s elites from positions of power and replace them with regular citizens, and has repeatedly called for a referendum on whether Italy should leave the eurozone. It is loath to make political compromises, refusing to participate in coalition governments.Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani reported from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Organization Moves to Avoid Possible Conflicts of Interest", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byIn its latest effort to defuse a major public relations problem that might have loomed over Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, the Trump Organization on Wednesday announced union accords at two major hotel holdings.Taken together, the moves suggest that Mr. Trump is sensitive to at least the perception that his business dealings could cast a shadow over his presidency, even if he has yet to detail how he might seek a more comprehensive solution to potential conflicts, such as outright divestment.\u201cOn the one hand, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this is meaningful, it does matter,\u201d Danielle Brian, the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog group, said of Wednesday\u2019s agreements. \u201cHowever, this piecemeal approach to dealing with conflicts is not going to deal with the bigger looming problem.\u201dOne of the two labor agreements provides a union contract to workers at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, whose union the hotel had previously refused to bargain with. The second agreement eases a hurdle to unionization at a recently opened Trump hotel in Washington.The agreements reduce the probability that the National Labor Relations Board, which protects the labor rights of private-sector employees, will be called on to adjudicate disputes between workers and the Trump Organization. That possibility raised the prospect of a conflict of interest if Mr. Trump were to retain a stake in his business.As president, Mr. Trump will eventually nominate all five members of the labor board, as well as its general counsel, who typically has the final say on whether to issue formal complaints against employers.The speed of the negotiations at the hotel in Las Vegas suggested that Mr. Trump was eager to put the issue behind him before his inauguration in January, after the hotel resisted workers\u2019 efforts to unionize there for most of the past year and a half.The hotel hired consultants who spoke with employees at mandatory meetings about the risks of unionizing, according to earlier statements from the union. In charges filed with the labor board, some workers alleged that they had been fired or suspended from their jobs because of their unionization efforts.After the successful union election last December, the hotel appealed within the labor board structure, arguing that workers had been intimidated into voting for the union. When the full board rejected its final appeal last month, the hotel appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Bethany Khan, a union representative, said the new labor agreement had come together over a few days of negotiation last week and been ratified by union members over the weekend. Under the accord, the workers will join locals for culinary workers and bartenders that are affiliated with Unite Here, a prominent national union that represents hotel workers.Donald J. Trump\u2019s global business empire will create an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest for a United States president, experts say.The two sides agreed to a contract beginning Jan. 1 and running through May 31, 2021, which follows a relatively standard template for hotels in Las Vegas by providing annual wage increases, pension and health benefits, and job protections.Under the second accord, the Trump International Hotel Washington D.C. agreed to remain neutral as workers seek to unionize under a card-check agreement, enabling workers to simply sign authorization cards indicating that they want to unionize. The hotel will recognize the union if a majority of workers sign cards.The alternative, a secret-ballot election, typically occurs when the employer opposes the unionization effort, as was the case at the Las Vegas property.In a statement referring to the agreement in Washington, Eric Danziger, the chief executive of Trump Hotels, said, \u201cWe share mutual goals with the union, as we both desire to ensure outstanding jobs for the employees, while also enabling the hotel to operate successfully in a competitive environment.\u201dWednesday\u2019s agreements do not eliminate the potential for conflicts of interest involving Mr. Trump and the labor board. The board\u2019s general counsel, whose replacement Mr. Trump will probably appoint next year, will be in a position to decide whether to issue complaints about allegations of labor rights violations, but could also leave the decision to career civil servants.Such allegations could include refusing to bargain with the union in the future, or firing or disciplining union stewards for sticking up for fellow members under procedures outlined in the contract.The decision on issuing a complaint is in some sense the critical step of the labor board process. There are typically 20,000 to 25,000 charges of unfair labor practices in a given year, of which only a fraction result in a complaint \u2014 about 1,270 last year \u2014 although some are settled beforehand.Any complaint issued by a regional director or the general counsel could then come before the board, at least some of whose members are likely to have been appointed by Mr. Trump. But if the general counsel declines to issue a complaint, the charge is effectively dead and generally cannot be appealed.\u201cIt\u2019s the gateway into litigation,\u201d said Wilma Liebman, a former labor board chairman.There remains an open charge of unfair labor practices against the Trump Organization, which was filed on behalf of a worker advocacy group in September over the contract that employees of the Trump presidential campaign were required to sign. The group alleged the contract\u2019s noncompete and confidentiality clauses illegally discouraged employees from exercising their labor rights.Mr. Trump and his organization faced a potentially punishing calculus in deciding to bargain with the union in Las Vegas, aside from the issues of conflict of interest.Even if the Trump hotel in Las Vegas had prevailed in its efforts to undo the union election in federal court, which was probably a long shot in itself, the culinary workers would probably have continued their unionization campaign, creating a lingering source of embarrassment for the president-elect.In September, workers at the Boulder Station casino in Las Vegas \u2014 owned by a company controlled by Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who until recently operated the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts promoter \u2014 voted to unionize after a dogged campaign by the union that lasted more than six years. The campaign included the creation of a website highlighting the expletive-laced tirades of the president of the U.F.C., and an effort by union affiliates in New York State to fight the league\u2019s attempts to overturn a law banning the sport there.\u201cThey fight really hard,\u201d said C. Jeffrey Waddoups, an economist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who studies union bargaining in the hotel and gambling industry. \u201cIt would draw a lot of attention.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the number of charges of unfair labor practices in a given year. There are typically 20,000 to 25,000 charges, not 25,000 to 30,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Avoidable Crash in Car Loans", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf successful, they will enfeeble an agency that has proved its worth time and again. In the past five years, the bureau has forced lenders to provide $11.7 billion in restitution and relief to 27 million consumers for illegal practices involving mortgages, foreclosures, credit cards, student loans, payday loans and other forms of credit.What can the consumer bureau do? The answer is, not much, and that is a big reason subprime auto lending is so troubling. Congress gave the bureau authority over banks and nonbank finance companies. But it did not give the agency authority over auto dealers. Auto dealers, who tend to be prominent constituents in most congressional districts, lobbied successfully to be exempted from regulation by the bureau. That special treatment has meant relatively weak oversight of auto lending, because many auto loans, though financed by regulated lenders, are arranged by dealers, who often have discretion over most loan terms.A bust in subprime auto lending, when it happens, won\u2019t shatter the economy as the mortgage bust did. But it will harm millions of Americans. More and better financial oversight could help to avoid this outcome, but Congress is intent on moving in the opposite direction.Advertisement"}

Duck into one of many stairwells that will eventually lead to the rim of the ancient Citadel complex, a rambling collection of remnants from the Roman, Byzantine and Umayyad periods, with a 360-degree view of the neighboring ranges. At the Temple of Hercules, two massive columns topped with an arch dramatically frame the setting sun. Head to the overlook around 6 p.m., when the mesmerizing calls to prayer cascade from dozens of minarets dotting the hilly panorama, building into a symphony. Juice stalls and sidewalk cafes are far more common than bars, but there are some Western-style watering holes. Two that you won\u2019t find easily are OTR, Jordan\u2019s first hipster speakeasy, and tiny Petro. Wedged between alleyways downtown, Petro is a dark, smoky dive with a back room about as wide as a delivery van and with pints of gold label Arak Haddad to go. Order two glasses (4 dinars), served with almonds and white cheese, perch at a back counter and watch the colorful characters come and go. OTR, for Off the Record, is an upper-crust hideaway with a dress code, a 1920s jazz motif and cocktails like the Street Swing (arak, pomegranate juice, triple sec and lemon juice; 8 dinars). A popular breakfast ballast in the Middle East is fuul, a mashed fava bean concoction served up fast, tasty and cheap at Hashem on King Faisal Street downtown. Find a table in the alleyway under the strung lights and big umbrellas, and ask a green-aproned waiter for the fuul and falafel. Soon bowls of fuul and luscious hummus in local olive oil will arrive, along with bite-size falafel balls and French fries.

{"Headline": "Seeing Africa by Road", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWe had made it to Tete, Mozambique. The sun was sinking behind the Zambezi River like a scoop of orange sherbet as we sat on the motel\u2019s deck taking in the quiet close of another long day on the road. But we avoided one another\u2019s eyes. The table in front of us was cluttered with maps, notebooks, competing spreadsheets and empty beer bottles.\u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d Robert said. \u201cMozambique\u2019s interesting, but it kind of reminds me of Spain in the \u201980s. Maybe we should go our separate ways.\u201dFor days, tensions had been building. It was hard traveling with another family, facing the endless decision-making of a road trip, especially this one. Robert and his wife, two Dutch friends whose children are about the same age as ours, were hankering to go west to see Botswana\u2019s Kalahari Desert and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. I had promised our two boys, Apollo, 6, and Asa, 4, that we would hit the beach in Mozambique, fabled for its pristine coastline.But this wasn\u2019t just a quibble over the route, which, in the spirit of this trip, we had always intended to be flexible. We were getting on one another\u2019s nerves. No. That\u2019s too soft. We were annoying the bejesus out of one another.We were locking horns over everything \u2014 when to stop and fill up the jerrycans, which little guesthouse to sleep in, whether to get chicken and chips or omelets, again, for dinner, great chunks of silence sitting between us at meals.And now as we contemplated the nuclear option, breaking up, we were staring down the most treacherous road of the entire trip: Mozambique\u2019s Tete corridor, where a conflict that had claimed thousands of lives was reawakening.Some people had just been ambushed, the motel manager told us. \u201cBy who?\u201d I asked. He just shrugged. \u201cBandits? Rebels? Rogue police officers?\u201dIt was all the same to him. \u201cAnd from Inchope to Save,\u201d he said offhandedly, mentioning two towns on our map. \u201cMeu Deus,\u201d he said, closing his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s even worse.\u201dThe next morning my wife, Courtenay, and our sons jumped into our truck. \u201cRoll \u2019em up, lock \u2019em up,\u201d I said as we swung out of the parking lot. We headed down a long, bright highway by ourselves. I\u2019d told Robert that we would meet him in Cape Town, though who knew if either of us would actually make it. Cape Town was still nearly 2,000 miles away.This odyssey \u2014 driving across the bottom half of Africa, without any firm plans \u2014 started out as a lark. We were at a birthday party at Robert\u2019s house; at the time, (which was late last year), we all lived in Nairobi, Kenya.During the festivities, Robert abruptly turned down the music and called everyone outside. He has worked all over the world for the United Nations and other international organizations and speaks about 38 languages. You know what military officers call \u201ccommand presence\u201d? Well, Robert has it in spades: tall, handsome, confident, topped by a wicked crest of pure white hair. He also has an awesome smile.The instant he told everyone to go outside, I knew what he was up to. He was going to give his wife a car, and I could tell from the glint in his eye that this was as much a selfie gift as anything. Stepping into the driveway, everyone gasped and started laughing: He had bought her an old green Land Rover Defender, the ultimate safari vehicle, and wrapped it in Christmas lights adorned with Chinese lanterns.Maybe we had all had a little too much to drink, but in the glow of the moment I swung my arm around Robert\u2019s back and mumbled, with Champagne breath: \u201cWith a car like that, you can\u2019t just drive to the mall. Hey, man. Why don\u2019t we drive to Cape Town?\u201dIt was the most ambitious road trip any of us had ever planned: 4,250 miles one way, 16 days, six countries, five young children, four hardheaded adults and two questionable trucks. \u201cSounds like a bad Christmas carol,\u201d Courtenay muttered. To be honest, she was never into it.Most areas we intended to pass through in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa were relatively safe for drivers, northern Mozambique being the one question mark. But it wasn\u2019t as though we had AAA for back up. You break down in rural Malawi or back roads Tanzania, where there aren\u2019t any spare parts or much transport, and you might as well get comfortable for a week. And our truck was no spring chicken. It was a Nissan Patrol, sturdy as heck but 11 years old and with more than 100,000 miles and a few rattles.This all might sound risky, maybe even reckless, but I\u2019ve lived in East Africa for more than a decade and felt comfortable traveling here, knowing the region was more accessible than most people appreciate.As the push-off date approached, our mountain of gear stupidly grew. (When you take a road trip, you\u2019re the worst packer. You think: \u201cOh, yeah. We\u2019ll have all the room in the world.) Soon we were running out of space in our operational staging area. Our guest room was heaped with mosquito nets, tarps, sleeping bags, bed rolls, tin dishes, flats of water, a monstrous medical kit containing everything from malaria prophylaxis to Tums, copies of our passports, visas and this thing called a \u201cCarnet de Passages,\u201d a very official-looking customs document that allows you to cross borders in your own vehicle. We\u2019d also packed too many clothes, a satellite transmitter, spark plugs, granola, nuts, fuses, boxed milk, an air pump, a tow rope and seven packages of Huggies, for the long rides.Little did we know that within a few days, in Malawi, we would enter the dominion of Shoprite, a South African chain, where we could have bought many of these supplies if we had actually needed them.As we pulled out of our driveway, car stuffed, I looked up to see dark clouds and bright sunshine, the dramatic, schizophrenic lighting that often illuminates Nairobi\u2019s equatorial skies. We passed zebras in Kajiado, an area that used to be rural but in the frenzied urbanization of Nairobi in the last 10 years is now more like a suburb. By midday, we reached the Tanzanian border.We spent the next hour and a half waiting in lines, to get our passports stamped, to get our yellow fever cards checked, to show our Carnet de Passages. Then we were free, out on the road again chugging past trucks with inspirational messages emblazoned on their backsides such as \u201cLove Your Enemies.\u201dWe crossed into Tanzania that same day, and the landscape immediately opened up: lush, green savanna unrolling from the sides of the highway. We passed through a string of villages, each specializing in a particular commodity. In the first, everyone along the road sold chickens. In the next, eggs. The village after that, oranges. We motored through spiky sisal fields that ran for miles and miles and ended in a town where dozens of people were selling wooden hand-carved stools \u2014 they were actually carving them along the road, flakes of wood shavings littering the highway\u2019s shoulders \u2014 being gently stirred by the wind of our passing wheels.In rural Africa the economy isn\u2019t hidden, as it is in the United States. You drive right through it.Robert was right behind me as I took a curve, perhaps a little fast. Ahead, I saw a man in a white uniform step out from under a mango tree into the road. Shoot. A police officer. He had his arm up, which meant stop.In eastern Africa, most traffic officers don\u2019t have guns, radios or cars. You could blow past them and probably never get in trouble. It\u2019s essentially an honor system: You stop because it\u2019s the right thing to do. The officer sauntered up to my window with a black plastic object that I could have sworn was an old hair dryer. It was actually a radar gun, one that looked like it belonged in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit.\u201d I had been speeding, he said.Soon we were whizzing past baboons shrieking from trees. Our boys kept a running tally of all the animals we saw: monkeys, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, gazelles, antelope, warthogs, even elephants. Tanzania is rightly celebrated for its wildlife.A few bites into dinner, I could tell that the food \u2014 burgers, chips and roast chicken \u2014 was fresh and had been made with care. As we bedded down, I heard lions grunting in the distance. Or maybe it was just Robert snoring in the tent next to me.\u201cMan, never in my life did I think I\u2019d be here,\u201d Robert said, smiling in the doorway of a border town barbershop where we went looking to change money. \u201cMalawi was always distant in my memory, like this little country lost in the middle of Africa.\u201dAs soon as we crested a hill and for the first time spotted Lake Malawi sunning itself, Courtenay said: \u201cCan I sit in a beach chair just once on this trip? Is that asking too much?\u201dRobert and company supplied the answer: Butterfly Space, a small eco-resort on Nkhata Bay. It sounded amazing, from the guidebooks: \u201cspacious beachfront,\u201d \u201cpicturesque beauty,\u201d an \u201coasis.\u201d We booked it from the road, calling just a few hours ahead. We did that a lot, conducting a little internet research the night before or flicking through a guidebook, which gave us flexibility, because we didn\u2019t know how far we would get each day.We rolled in at night, always a no-no; in the dark it\u2019s hard to tell what you\u2019re getting. A guard steered us to a campsite that smelled of dog poop. As I was helping Robert set up his tent, I noticed garbage strewed everywhere. But I didn\u2019t want to sound negative about a place he had picked, so I kept my mouth shut.\u201cHey, mon.\u201d It was a voice from the bushes. \u201cUh, yeah?\u201d I answered, looking around. A young man stepped out, dreadlocked and glassy-eyed. \u201cName\u2019s Happy.\u201d \u201cHappy what?\u201d Robert growled.Robert and I hadn\u2019t eaten for hours, and the two of us were dangerously crabby. We just wanted to get the tents up and find some food. \u201cHappy Coconut, mon,\u201d the young man answered. \u201cHappy Coconut. I\u2019m soooo happy.\u201d Robert shook his head and whispered, \u201cI think the guy writing the guidebook was high when he passed through here.\u201dButterfly Space slithered with tattooed travelers smelling of patchouli oil and Malawi Gold (the cheap and potent local ganja). We weren\u2019t prudes, but it didn\u2019t seem to be the ideal family spot.The next morning we hit the road. We tended to drive about 10 hours a day, starting around 8 a.m., and by dusk we would find a small hotel or guesthouse, usually for no more than $50, sometimes for as little as $10.Road trips are as much about what is happening inside the car as out. Our collective brood, all boys between ages 4 and 7, did surprisingly well, napping, looking out the windows and pulling each other\u2019s hair only occasionally.The roads were tarmac all through Malawi and Tanzania. The only problem was gas. Malawi has few fuel stations, and I ran out twice, rescued by Robert.I think our best day of the entire trip was shortly before we split up.We had treated ourselves to a classy old whitewashed hotel, the Sunbird Livingstonia Beach Hotel, on Salima Bay. It wasn\u2019t even that expensive, around 90,000 Kwacha a night, or about $125, and we took the day off from driving to swim in the body-temperature lake and get tossed around by the waves. I didn\u2019t want to leave. But Robert and his team hadn\u2019t signed up for a beach holiday, and driving all the way to Cape Town had been my great idea, after all.When we told the room steward that we had to go, he shook his head wistfully. \u201cIt\u2019d be great to see other countries, see how other people live,\u201d he said, folding a sheet. \u201cIn Malawi, everyone\u2019s born in Malawi. They live in Malawi. They die in Malawi. They don\u2019t see anything else.\u201dThe instant we crossed the border, it felt as though we were in a different place. This is a huge benefit of arriving in a new country by land. You immediately get a sense of its development, its atmosphere, its spirit, which is hard to do in an antiseptic international airport. One of the few former Portuguese colonies in Africa (most of the continent was grabbed up by France or England), Mozambique has a palpable Latin vibe. The storefront colors were zanier, the clothes tighter, the music louder. As we cruised through a tiny village blasting salsa, Courtenay turned to me and asked, \u201cIs this country deaf?\u201d We were without comrades now. We had emerged unscathed from the scorched wastes of Tete and were flying downhill toward the legendary Praia do Bilene beach, on Mozambique\u2019s southern coast.When we pulled in, I couldn\u2019t even hear Courtenay\u2019s yelling which way to go because of the roar of motorcycle engines. Young South Africans raced around on Ninja bikes, shirtless or in bikinis. We discovered that Mozambique during Christmas is a bit of a South African colony.After getting the keys to a rundown rondoval at a seaside hotel, we scampered to the beach, to sand that sparkled \u2014 but not in the way you might imagine. It was the day after New Year\u2019s. Thousands of beer bottles lay at the water\u2019s edge, as though they had been vomited up by the sea. The place was a pigsty, but our boys loved it, collecting dozens of dirty bottles and making giant bottle castles.In Kenya, you\u2019d never see that. Poor people would have been all over that beach, scooping up the empties to make money from recycling. Courtenay and I found the whole scene depressing and consoled ourselves with heaping plates of rice, p\u00e3ozinho (Portuguese rolls) and shrimp so succulent and tasty that even the boys \u2014 who usually flee at the sight of anything unusual on their plates, especially if that unusual thing has eyes \u2014 gobbled it up.But our clock was ticking. Robert was somewhere out there, chugging his way south. Though we\u2019d had our disagreements, I missed seeing that dark green Land Rover behind me.As we hustled toward the Swaziland border, a wall of brown, stubbly mountains rising before us, I guess I started to zone out. I didn\u2019t see her until it was too late. A corpulent police officer stepped out from under a tree. That was always their strategy: Hang out in the shade and wait for a victim. It was the equivalent of the American patrol officer on a motorcycle hiding behind a billboard. She walked into the road, arm up. When I pulled over, she fanned her face.\u201cQue calor, que calor,\u201d she said. (How hot.) \u201cIndeed,\u201d I responded.She asked for my license. I gave it to her. She asked for my insurance. I gave her that as well (a special Mozambican policy covering who knows what that I had spent $60 on at the border). She frowned.The boys stirred in the back seat, as she made a leisurely loop around the truck. She returned to my window. \u201cYou pay fine,\u201d she said.\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.Her eyes darted around. \u201cBaby no have seatbelt.\u201d\u201cWhat? He just took it off. We\u2019ve been stopped for three minutes.\u201d\u201cBaby no seatbelt. We go police station Matola.\u201d\u201cMatola?\u201d I said incredulously. \u201cIsn\u2019t that an hour away?\u201d\u201cThen pay fine here,\u201d she said, staring into my face. \u201cThree hundred meticals.\u201dAfter I handed it over, she waved happily goodbye.By the time we reached South Africa, we had six days of vacation left and more than 1,000 miles to go. I had visited South Africa nearly a dozen times, but I had never driven the country. The landscape was dreamy: rippling green hills, tall trees and miles and miles of farms and vineyards stocked with grapes so plump and juicy, you just wanted to pull over and pluck them.I found myself asking: \u201cHow did this happen? How did South Africa get all the good land?\u201dWe caught one of the most beautiful sunsets I\u2019d ever seen. Over the west side of the N2 highway, fingers of light reached into a cool, dark forest. We made three stops on the way to Cape Town, our favorite being St. Lucia, a well-kempt town sporting carpets of crab grass for front lawns. It felt like Boca Raton, Fla., except for the 3,000-pound hippos lumbering through the neat little streets at night. Set in a large estuary filled with life, St. Lucia is a great place for a boat tour to see hippos and crocodiles, which we enjoyed, booking through Hornbill House, the bed-and-breakfast where we stayed. We were all eager to get to Cape Town, arguably one of the world\u2019s most stunning cities. Our boys were excited to see the penguins at the Simon\u2019s Town penguin colony. I was ready to stop driving. Courtenay just wanted the trip to end.I wished I had seen more. Driving across Africa was far more doable than I expected: The roads were safe, the border crossings not too hellish, and it was no sweat booking hotels by cellphone on the fly.But we should have taken two months, not two weeks. Then we could have explored more wildlife parks, slipped off the main roads and lingered in small, charming towns, as opposed to getting up at the crack of dawn and strapping in again.Robert, God bless him, arranged for two couples to fly to Cape Town and drive our vehicles back to Nairobi, because they wanted to have the same road trip experience. On that final Sunday, we loaded into our trucks one last time and drove to the airport, his truck right behind mine. Then eight hours later, we were all back home.Jeffrey Gettleman has been the East Africa bureau chief for The New York Times for the past decade, and he is coming out with a memoir in May 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Suggests It Has Placed Weapons on Disputed Spratly Islands in South China Sea", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China signaled on Thursday that it had installed weapons on disputed South China Sea islands and would use them like a \u201cslingshot\u201d to repel threats, compounding tensions with the incoming Trump administration.The Chinese message, in a Defense Ministry statement, suggested that China was further watering down a pledge made by its president, Xi Jinping, to not militarize the islands.The comments left little doubt that such installations were part of China\u2019s plan to deepen its territorial claim over the islands, which has raised tensions with its neighbors over their rival claims and with Washington over freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest commercial waterways.They were also likely to further complicate China\u2019s already testy relations with President-elect Donald J. Trump. China\u2019s rapid creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea, expanding former reefs and outcrops into guarded permanent outposts, has already become a major source of tension with Washington.Repeatedly this year, the Chinese have accused the United States of making \u201cprovocative\u201d moves by sending warships near some of these islands, known as the Spratlys.The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, which released the images through its Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said they showed \u201clarge antiaircraft guns and probable close-in weapons systems,\u201d which can theoretically thwart cruise missile attacks.\u201cAs for necessary military facilities, they are primarily for defense and self-protection, and this is proper and legitimate,\u201d the Defense Ministry said. \u201cFor instance, if someone was at the door of your home, cocky and swaggering, how could it be that you wouldn\u2019t prepare a slingshot?\u201dThere was no immediate comment from Mr. Trump or his transition team.During his campaign, Mr. Trump dwelled on accusations that China had systematically sapped American industrial might, and he has indicated that trade issues will be a priority in dealings with Beijing. But the latest disclosures suggest how seemingly remote islands in the South China Sea could become a source of serious tensions, even military strife.The Spratlys, which China calls the Nansha Islands, are the subject of an especially volatile mix of competing claims. Parts of the archipelago are also claimed by the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan. And the possibility of undersea oil and gas deposits has exacerbated the rivalries.But China, with the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and a swelling military budget, has established an intimidating dominance across much of the South China Sea. And the latest satellite images appeared to confirm its deepening military grip on the Spratlys.The steps \u201cshow that Beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,\u201d the Asia Maritime Defense Initiative said in its report about the images.\u201cAmong other things, they would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others\u201d against air bases that may soon go into operation on the islands, it said.The images showed that the facilities were in place before Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.The Obama administration sought to play down both the images and the Chinese Defense Ministry\u2019s response. \u201cWe watch Chinese naval developments very carefully, and we urge all parties in the South China Sea to avoid actions that raise tensions,\u201d said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.The images elicited a far more contentious response from hawkish Republicans, who do not necessarily share Mr. Trump\u2019s views on China trade policy but see Beijing\u2019s actions in the South China Sea as an aggressive challenge to the United States.Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the images confirmed \u201cwhat has long been evident: China is militarizing the South China Sea, its leaders continue to lie about that fact, and Beijing is paying little to no price for its behavior.\u201dSome American military officials suggested privately that the antiaircraft emplacements were purely defensive in nature, with a limited range, useful only if the outposts were under attack.Of greater concern, they said, was the possibility that China could one day install more advanced antiaircraft missile systems on the islands, which can fire at targets hundreds of miles away.The Chinese government has said it respects freedom of civilian passage in the South China Sea but also called American naval \u201cfreedom of navigation operations\u201d dangerous meddling. The Chinese navy has not tried to block the operations.A spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that his government had been entitled to take such steps and said they did not count as \u201cmilitarization.\u201dThe spokesman, Geng Shuang, said he could not confirm the precise findings from the latest satellite images but disputed they indicated any change on China\u2019s part.\u201cIf China constructing normal facilities on its own islands and deploying necessary territorial defense facilities counts as \u2018militarization,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cthen what about sending fleets through the South China Sea?\u201dHelene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time for a Reset", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTurning PointsIn statistical terms, 2016 was a year of continuity for the world economy, as performance was quite similar to that of recent years. The big changes were political, as a widespread anti-globalization movement signaled a breakdown in a consensus among most political leaders that had held since the end of the World War II. It used to be generally accepted that reducing trade barriers increases prosperity and promotes peace, benefiting investing and recipient countries and promoting international cooperation in solving problems around the world. Almost all of this was called into question in 2016.Both major party presidential candidates in the United States professed to be staunchly opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and Donald J. Trump called for ripping up existing trade treaties like Nafta. Across the Atlantic, British voters opted to leave the European Union, while the ruling Conservative Party challenged the rights of foreign workers and the head of the Labour Party embraced socialism and expressed skepticism of Britain\u2019s NATO membership. A trade deal between the European Union and hardly threatening Canada was almost scuppered by a recalcitrant Belgian province concerned about the effects of globalization on local workers. Movements hostile to the longstanding vision of an ever more united Europe gained strength in every major country.Resistance to globalization was not confined to the West, nor to the industrialized world. Leaders including Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Vladimir Putin in Russia, Xi Jinping in China and Narendra Modi in India all appealed to national pride, core values and strength, each placing uncomfortable emphasis on some variant of ethnic purity. In all four cases, any interest in universal values of openness or human rights is very much secondary to the reassertion of national strength.This renaissance of nationalism and resistance to globalization appears to be universal, and not the exclusive preserve of either the left or right. It seems to stem from a profound sense on the part of many groups that their lives are buffeted by forces beyond their control. As people\u2019s distance increases in a geographic sense, in a cultural sense, and in the sense of a lack of shared identity, they lose confidence in their leaders\u2019 abilities to protect them. Insecurity is begetting atavism.These trends pose dangers. For all the problems and challenges, the past 70 years have been a period of unprecedented progress in increasing human emancipation, prosperity, life expectancy and in reducing violence. All of this would be at risk.We need to redirect the global economic dialogue to the promotion of \u201cresponsible nationalism\u201d rather than on international integration for its own sake. A classic example of a misguided initiative is the effort to promote a bilateral investment treaty between the United States and China. Even in the unlikely event that such a treaty could be negotiated, its effect would be to trade a reduction in America\u2019s ability to control the behavior of Chinese companies in the United States for increased security for American global companies when they locate production facilities or otherwise invest in China. From the point of view of a typical middle-class American voter, the deal is lose-lose.To enable the international community to engage in this dialogue, global cooperation is key, with the focus of economic diplomacy on measures that increase the range of policies that governments can pursue to support middle-class workers domestically.When the Allied nations met in 1944 at Bretton Woods to negotiate the rules and procedures of a new international monetary system, the economist John Maynard Keynes recognized that a global economy will have a systematic bias toward contraction if countries that have borrowed heavily are forced to cut back spending while no pressure is applied to countries that are running large surpluses.While economic growth continued in 2016 for the United States, the European Union and Japan, it did so at rates that would have seemed unacceptably low a decade ago. In these three economies, inflation remained below the 2 percent target that central banks aim for, and market indicators suggest that it might well remain so for the next decade. And most interest rates continued their downward trend, reflecting the diminished inflation expectations and a high level of saving relative to investment.These and other statistics indicate that the United States and Europe are just one recessionary shock away from being caught in a deflationary trap. Japan has been stuck in one for more than a decade, with expectations of decreasing prices prompting consumers to delay spending and save money. Assuring adequate pressure for stimulus needs to become a priority for the Group of 20, to precaution against deflation.Given figures on the hundreds of billions of dollars lost annually because of tax sheltering, the gains from a global effort to prevent capital income from escaping taxation are at least comparable to those from highly controversial trade agreements. And such measures would make possible more support for the middle class.In recent years we have also commenced a race to the bottom in areas like labor standards, environmental protections and capital requirements for banks. Businesses evade stiffer rules by moving elsewhere, hindering national aspirations to improve in these areas. The remedy is international dialogue directed at establishing global minimum standards, harmonizing approaches.Finally, fences, walls and barriers are not an effective approach to resisting undesired flows of people. The only enduring solution to the unprecedented flood of refugees will come from creating conditions that enable people to do what they most prefer \u2014 stay at home. The global gain from supporting source countries is much greater than the gain to any one nation from limiting support solely to the refugees within its borders.The events of 2016 will be remembered either as a point at which we began to turn away from globalization or the one at which the strategies of globalization began to be reoriented away from elite and toward mass interests. As we make our choices over the next few years, the stakes are very high.Lawrence H. Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and president emeritus at Harvard University.

Despite their preferences for those three, Democrats who were polled said they \u201cgenerically want a younger candidate who hasn\u2019t run for president before,\u201d according to the pollster, PPP.But we seem to be in an era when older candidates are not unusual, and Donald Trump will be 74 in 2020.Of course, there\u2019s also a decent chance it won\u2019t be any of those three.This is not close to a comprehensive list, but that\u2019s a start. And of course I have no inside knowledge on whether those people would run.His vision for how to win the primary proved to be wrong \u2014 long story short, he wasn\u2019t able to win over black voters.But what about his vision as applied to the recent presidential election, and to future ones? Democrats are now debating whether to take more of a class-based approach, focusing on economic issues for working families instead of on identity politics.I do think Democrats ought to question whether they\u2019re as good for working-class voters, and especially white working-class voters, as they say they are. And I\u2019d ask social democrats more widely and Marxists to question it as well.Whenever the left-liberal coalition in the United States is forced to choose between a concern of workers and (for lack of a better word) the activist left, they choose the left. It\u2019s true on the environment, and you can see what that\u2019s done to Democratic strength in Appalachia. It\u2019s true on immigration.The party doesn\u2019t have any credible case for helping the old industrial economy (perhaps in no small part because there is no way to help the old industrial economy, given the rise of automation for one thing). Even if it\u2019s well intentioned, the Democrats\u2019 alternative \u2014 to boost the pay and security of new service-sector jobs \u2014 just isn\u2019t what these voters seem to want.That will start to come in very soon, but probably won\u2019t be completed for months. Second is the census Current Population Survey, which asks voters about turnout after federal elections. And third is the microdata for pre-election polls, which includes demographic data and vote choice for all of a survey\u2019s respondents, not just the summary result that\u2019s published.At the end of all of this, I suspect we\u2019ll have a much better sense of turnout, vote shifts since 2012 and how the polls were off.The results in Iowa were the clearest illustration that the Republican landslide on Tuesday was not just because of low Democratic turnout in off-year elections. On Tuesday, Joni Ernst, now a Republican senator-elect, won a decisive nine-point victory. She swept much of traditionally Democratic eastern Iowa, where Democrats have long fared well with rural voters.These gains suggest that demographic trends have not doomed Republicans to minority-party status, as some political analysts predicted.The next Republican presidential candidate could outperform Mr. Romney among white voters by holding Republican gains in the South and winning back some of the white Obama voters of the rural North.So, personally, I\u2019m not really looking back on 2014 and thinking \u201cwe should have known\u201d Clinton would lose in the way that she did. I think 2016 with Trump was much more of a decisive break from recent trends than it was a continuation of what we saw between 2008 and 2014.I\u2019m not at all convinced that Michigan was part of Marco Rubio\u2019s path to victory, for instance. I suspect that a more traditional Republican would have been highly competitive in Virginia and Colorado \u2014 just as competitive as in Pennsylvania, for example.I don\u2019t think Rubio could have won some of these white working-class Obama counties in Wisconsin by 25 points, for instance. I absolutely think he could have won Wisconsin.Anyway, Steve Bullock is the governor of Montana. He won re-election last month, even as Clinton lost the state by 20 points.On paper, he\u2019s interesting. He has the sort of complicated biography that gives him the potential to connect with several different parts of the Democratic coalition: He\u2019s a red-state populist with a strong record for progressives on campaign finance when he was the state\u2019s attorney general. He has a pedigree of Claremont McKenna, Columbia Law, professor at George Washington University that, unfortunately, I think is a factor in whether the party elite take him seriously.Obviously \u201con paper\u201d doesn\u2019t mean all that much \u2014 just ask Scott Walker.I\u2019ve watched a few YouTube videos, and Bullock seems compelling to me. (He was on Rachel Maddow\u2019s show when he was attorney general, talking about his suit against Citizens United.)Who knows whether he would hold up in national politics, or whether he\u2019s even interested.He\u2019s just 50 years old, too. The Democrats don\u2019t have too many options who have won re-election in that age range.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Contrarian\u2019s View on Inflation Fears", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewAs the United States economy braces itself for the presidency of Donald J. Trump, many have been quick to point out that the policies of the incoming administration may have the unintended consequence of fueling inflation.They argue that the prospect of a large fiscal stimulus as the economy is approaching full employment may create shortages in the labor market. Additionally, substantial infrastructure spending could spark a rally in commodity prices, lifting the cost of producing manufactured goods.The Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec. 14 reinforced the inflation fear, and cited the strengthening labor market and inflation as it increased the federal funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to between 0.50 and 0.75 percent. Of course the Fed should be alert to threats to price stability. But the current concerns could very well be overdone.Already, markets around the world have reacted to the prospect of these policies. But the sharp rise in the exchange value of the dollar along with a marked increase in bond yields is hardly the backdrop associated with rising inflation in the United States. While many market participants point to the sharp increase in interest rates as evidence of rising inflationary expectations, that does not square with a stronger dollar and lower prices in precious metals and relatively stable energy markets. The Fed announcement of three expected rate increases in 2017 is a more aggressive stance from the central bank, which should serve to further strengthen the dollar.Contrast that with Britain, where the pound\u2019s sharp depreciation after June\u2019s Brexit vote has revived inflation, which hit a two-year high in November.An examination of a similar period in American history when United States policy resulted in large fiscal stimulus through military spending and tax cuts, along with lighter regulation, shows that supply side shocks are not necessarily inflationary. The Reagan revolution of the early 1980s resulted in a stronger dollar and a meaningful, if not painful, decline in precious metals and energy prices. Inflationary pressures waned in the years subsequent to the 1980 election, even as monetary policy became increasingly accommodative.While it would be foolhardy to say history will repeat itself, I am reminded of the quip that it often rhymes.Experience plainly shows that fiscal stimulus, especially when monetary policy is on a more restrictive path, results in higher real rates of interest and a stronger currency. Higher real rates help to tamp down inflation while a stronger dollar reduces import prices.No one should be surprised that markets are already adjusting to reflect a stronger domestic economy, but this does not necessarily lead to higher core or headline inflation. As a matter of fact, the recent market moves have already primed the pipeline with disinflationary forces that will greet the new administration.The incoming administration\u2019s focus on deregulation and support for domestic energy production strengthens the argument against a sudden surge in prices.Wages will probably be a different story. As the economy approaches full employment, wage pressures are expected to mount. Tax cuts, infrastructure spending, deregulation and support for domestic energy production all point to a powerful fiscal elixir which will increase demand for labor and encourage increased consumption.Americans and the world should welcome a surge in wage growth. Income inequality in the United States has become as pronounced as at any time since the Gilded Age. Political and social instability is challenging policy makers as populist uprisings spread from one region to another.As wages rise, consumer prices are likely to remain restrained. The resulting increase in real earnings along with increased job availability should foster an environment which encourages public confidence in political institutions by reducing economic inequality across classes and creating more opportunities for all.There are many who would have preferred a different path. Some of their concerns are well founded. Policies that result in trade wars or mass deportations would undermine the success of a Trump economic revolution. These policies would not only create severe headwinds to growth but could result in recession or worse. These pitfalls must be avoided.If the Trump economic plan is successfully carried out, the Fed is likely to find itself raising rates more rapidly than the market is currently expecting, not because inflation is rising but because the natural rate of interest is rising in line with higher potential output.As the Fed moves to adjust for faster growth, shorter-maturity Treasurys will be more vulnerable to further price declines while the risk of a sudden spike in inflation will diminish. Bond yields are not rising because of increasing inflationary expectations; they are rising because of an increase in anticipation of real growth. Given that inflationary fears are overblown, longer-term bond yields are probably close to their highs for this cycle, and the environment will remain positive for riskier assets like high-yield bonds, bank loans and stocks.Scott Minerd is chairman of investments and global chief investment officer for Guggenheim Partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Wonders, if U.S. Balks, Is Carbon Pricing Still the Answer?", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets on Friday with the leaders of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories to work out a national carbon pricing plan, Donald J. Trump will also be in the room, in a manner of speaking.The president-elect has expressed skepticism about climate change, support for the fossil fuel industry and a desire to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. That has raised a big question for Canada: Can it move forward with a carbon policy if America is headed in the opposite direction?Mr. Trudeau certainly wants to push ahead. His government wants every province and territory to adopt a plan to reduce carbon emissions by putting a price on them \u2014 either through a tax on fossil fuels or a cap-and-trade system of emission allowances for industry. If they refuse to do one or the other voluntarily, he has warned, the national government will impose a plan on them.Many of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s political rivals argue that it would be irresponsible to move ahead now with carbon pricing in Canada if the United States will not be doing the same thing. But carbon-tax proponents say the opposite, that Canada could gain a competitive advantage by acting before its much larger neighbor.The only regional leader who has balked publicly is Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan. He has emerged as the effective head of an informal group that says having Mr. Trump in the White House must mean no carbon taxes in Canada.Carbon pricing \u201cis very risky for us to do, especially when our biggest trading partner is not going to do it,\u201d Mr. Wall said in an interview last week. \u201cIt does not mean that we\u2019re not concerned, or we don\u2019t want to move on climate change. I just think there\u2019s an orthodoxy that\u2019s grown up around carbon pricing: \u2018If you don\u2019t care about carbon pricing, you don\u2019t care about the earth.\u2019\u201dBut next door to Saskatchewan, in the oil-producing province of Alberta, Shannon Phillips, the environment minister, is equally adamant that Mr. Trump\u2019s election makes no difference to Canada\u2019s decision. \u201cOn Nov. 7, the American price on carbon was something like zero,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Nov. 8 changes very little.\u201dMr. Trudeau said in early October that the provinces would have to introduce a minimum carbon price of 10 Canadian dollars per metric ton (about $6.80 a ton) starting in 2018. Over the next five years, that would quintuple.Now Mr. Wall\u2019s chief worry is the Bakken oil field, which straddles the American border. If Saskatchewan has a carbon tax and the United States does not, Mr. Wall said, the oil companies working the field \u201cwill literally go a mile and drill in North Dakota.\u201dA Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions.Several economists say that worry is misplaced. Aside from ignoring Saskatchewan\u2019s advantages over North Dakota, most notably its pipeline network, they said Mr. Wall was exaggerating the impact of carbon taxes on investment decisions.The main opposition party in the federal Parliament, the Conservatives, say that carbon pricing will jeopardize the future of Canadian industry, which generally exports most of its production to the United States.Before Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election in November 2015, the Conservative-led government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper withdrew the country from international commitments on climate issues, saying they were unrealistic. Mr. Trudeau campaigned on a promise to reverse that policy.Like Mr. Wall, Mr. Fast would prefer to focus on cutting emissions with new technology rather than with taxes or cap-and-trade. But proponents of carbon pricing say the new technologies will only be developed and used if carbon prices force companies to act.\u201cSo what has Trump changed? Not a lot,\u201d Mr. Sawyer said.He noted that most of the existing provincial carbon policies were intended to not have much effect on industrial plants. \u201cYou\u2019re imposing costs on a new factory,\u201d he said, adding that by doing so, the provinces were pushing new factories to be more efficient and keep other operating costs lower, potentially giving them an edge over plants in the United States.\u201cWhen viewed through this lens,\u201d Ms. Allan said, \u201ccarbon pricing moves from threat to opportunity.\u201dMr. Sawyer said the advent of a Trump administration would not force Canada to change course on climate policy, but it might slow the pace a bit.\u201cCanada has moved rapidly in the last two years at the federal and provincial level at implementing a whole series of stringent policies,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Canada\u2019s gotten a little bit ahead of everyone else right now. It doesn\u2019t mean stopping, it doesn\u2019t mean getting a little more aggressive. Canada has to pause and take stock, basically.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That included 15 percent surcharges above the original cost of the contracts, Judge Ercolini added.Mrs. Kirchner, who was president for two terms between 2007 and 2015, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and characterizes her legal troubles as little more than political persecution by her successor and rival, President Mauricio Macri.Mrs. Kirchner was indicted in May on charges of manipulating Argentina\u2019s Central Bank to bolster the peso. She is also under investigation in several other cases, many of which include Mr. B\u00e1ez, who was detained in April in a separate case relating to money laundering. Mr. B\u00e1ez has denied all charges against him.The indictments were announced a day after Mr. Macri fired the finance minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, in what was the first cabinet shake-up since he took office last year in the midst of a deep recession. The economy has taken longer to recover than he promised; economic activity plunged 4.7 percent in October, compared to the previous year, according to official figures released on Tuesday.Some analysts say the latest indictment could help Mr. Macri\u2019s center-right government make its case, even if implicitly, that it needs more time to revive the economy.\u201cIn the context of a weak economy, the government needs to remind voters of who came before them and the inheritance they received,\u201d said Marcelo Bermol\u00e9n, a political science professor at Universidad Austral in Buenos Aires. \u201cMuch of the strength of the government lies\u201d in keeping Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s profile alive so it will have someone to blame.\u201cThis could be useful for her in terms of victimization, which she is already doing,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.Mr. Berensztein added, however, that history was ultimately not on Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s side: \u201cEx-presidents in Argentina have not been really successful in regaining power once they leave office.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tariffs and the Trade Balance (Wonkish) (Updated)", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Before the election, I wrote that I intended to spend the time after in an orgy of serious policy analysis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because I thought we were going to have a president serious about policy. Sad! And in some ways it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to stay motivated about economic analysis when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in fact going to have a government that is completely uninterested in analysis, evidence, or truth of any kind.Still, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be doing some policy analysis anyway. Partly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal therapy, a temporary break from the political nightmare and a return to the pursuits of my younger years. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also relevant: power may have no interest in reality, but the rest of us still have an interest in knowing how things will work.To see why, think about competition between domestically-produced and foreign-produced goods in two markets: at home and abroad. How does the VAT or VAT-like tax affect competition in each market?Not at all. In the foreign market, domestic firms pay no tax on their sales, because the VAT is rebated; neither do foreign firms. In the domestic market, foreign firms pay the VAT-rate tariff, and domestic firms pay the VAT. So the playing field is level in the domestic markets as well.In short, a VAT isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a protectionist policy; it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even lead to a change in the exchange rate.What about straight tariffs? Here things get a bit more complicated.The starting point for a simple analysis of trade balances is the accounting identity,Current account + Capital account = 0where the current account is the trade balance broadly defined to include services and income from investments. The standard story then runs as follows: the capital account is determined by international differences in savings and investment opportunities, with capital inflows to countries that offer good returns. The real exchange rate then adjusts to ensure that the trade balance offsets these desired capital flows. In this simple story, a tariff shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lead to a lower trade deficit, as long as capital still wants to come here; it will just lead to a stronger dollar, making U.S. products less competitive. Imports will still be lower, but so will exports: you end up with the same trade balance, but with less trade.But this story is a bit too simple, because reduced openness to trade should also inhibit capital flows.To see why, first consider a reductio ad absurdum. Imagine that we discover a civilization on Alpha Centauri, too far away for any trade in physical goods or meaningful services. Would terrestrial investors nonetheless want to buy Centauri assets? No \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even if they earned a return, how would they bring it back to Earth?Clearly, then, capital flows do depend on the potential for trade in goods and services. But how does this work when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about restricted openness, not complete autarky?Think of it this way: when investors put funds into a country, they do so in the expectation that somebody will eventually extract real goods and services from that country and send them abroad. Put another way, trade deficits are always a temporary phenomenon, to be followed eventually by surpluses, and vice versa.Consider the case of Japan, which used to run large trade surpluses. It still runs a surplus on current account, thanks to income on its overseas investments, but these days it runs a significant deficit on goods trade (shown in the figure as a percentage of GDP).But how does a country make its eventual transition from trade deficit to trade surplus? Other things equal, via a depreciation in its real exchange rate. And this eventual depreciation reduces the return to foreign investors who buy domestic assets.The question then becomes, how big a depreciation is necessary? And the answer to that question depends on how open the economy is. If the trade balance needs to increase by, say, 5 percent of GDP, this will take a much bigger depreciation if initial exports are only 5 percent of GDP than if they start at 40 percent of GDP.So protectionism should inhibit capital flows. It reduces trade flows; this means that larger real exchange rate movements are necessary to accommodate swings in the capital account; and these exchange rate movements themselves reduce the return to international investment.By the way, this argument applies a fortiori to temporary trade policies. A Trump tariff that people expect to see rescinded by a future sane president would drive the dollar up temporarily, but the prospect of future depreciation would inhibit investments in the U.S..Now, all of this is a subtler channel than the crude notion that foreigners are taking advantage by selling more to us than they buy, and tariffs will fix that. Dollar appreciation would undermine some of the effects of unilateral tariffs, and definitely hurt exports. But a more protectionist world would in general have lower capital flows as well as less trade; and the U.S., as a recipient of capital inflows, would therefore end up with a lower trade deficit.What I did can be interpreted as the special case with a linear PPF.

{"Headline": "Notes on the Macroeconomic Situation", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "So the Fed has raised rates. It was, I\u2019d argue, a mistake, although not as severe a mistake as it would have been a year ago. Anyway, it seems like a good time to review where I think the economy stands, and what it means for monetary and fiscal policy.Does this mean that the case for easy monetary and fiscal policies is over? No, but it\u2019s subtler now: it hinges mainly on the precautionary motive. Right now the economy looks OK, but things may change. Of course they could get better, but they could also get worse \u2014 and the costs of weakness are much greater than those of unexpected strength, because we won\u2019t have a good policy response if it happens.What I mean is that because interest rates are still near zero, a bout of economic weakness can\u2019t be met with strong monetary expansion; and discretionary fiscal stimulus is politically hard, especially given who\u2019ll be running things. This strongly suggests that you want to build up some momentum, get further away from a lee shore, pick your metaphor; that means letting the economy build strength, inflation rise modestly. So as I said, I believe the Fed made a mistake, and would welcome a modest (1 or 2 point? maybe more?) rise in budget deficits, especially if it involved infrastructure spending.But what if we are about to get significant fiscal stimulus from Trump? Well, it won\u2019t be well-targeted, in terms of either demand or supply; that infrastructure build looks ever less likely, so we\u2019re talking high-end tax cuts with low multipliers and little supply-side payoff. Such a policy might vindicate the Fed\u2019s rate hike, but it should still wait and see.Meanwhile, Trump deficits won\u2019t actually do much to boost growth, because rates will rise and there will be lots of crowding out. Also a strong dollar and bigger trade deficit, like Reagan\u2019s morning after Morning in America.So, the probable outlook is for not too great growth and deindustrialization. Not quite what people expect.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland\u2019s \u2018Ghost Ship,\u2019 Site of Fire, Was a Motley Warehouse With a History", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The first complaint came in 2014. Piles of trash were reported next to the building. Later that year, construction materials blocking the sidewalk drew another complaint. Last month, another was lodged, leading to an investigation of illegal construction inside.The tragedy prompted questions about what officials should have done to shut down the motley tenement. It also brought attention to the boom in illegal housing across the region, where many people have resorted to makeshift living arrangements because they have been priced out of the regular market. The questions were many: How did the fire start? Was it accidental or deliberate? Will anyone be punished for the carnage?The building did not have a permit for residences, or one for performances. Its landlord had a history of owning properties with building violations. People who had lived in the warehouse or visited described a place rife with fire hazards \u2014 a boarded-up upstairs exit, a cobbled-together stairway made partly of wooden pallets, propane tanks used to heat water, and piles of flammable debris.\u201cIt was a complete maze \u2014 I mean, there was really no clearly marked exits,\u201d said Ben Phelps-Rohrs, who told the public radio station KCRW he stepped outside the concert just before the fire broke out. \u201cIt was a place where you could lose yourself.\u201dInspectors from Oakland\u2019s Planning and Building Department had opened an investigation into illegal construction after the third complaint, but many said the city did not do enough to respond.\u201cThe community complained about debris; we react to it, we go and we clean it up,\u201d said Jose Ortiz, a neighborhood activist. \u201cIt\u2019s really ridiculous that we have to end up with a tragedy like this for the city officials to react to it.\u201dAt a news briefing on Monday afternoon, Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city would do \u201ceverything we can to ensure that you will get, that the families will get, that this city will get the answers to every question about this incident.\u201dThe Alameda County district attorney, Nancy O\u2019Malley, said that her office had begun a criminal investigation but that it was too soon to speculate about potential charges. Investigators are looking into whether anyone should be held criminally liable for the fire, she said. When pressed, she said charges could range from murder to involuntary manslaughter.The buildings department said it sent an inspector to the warehouse on Nov. 17, three days after the illegal construction complaint, but the inspector was unable to gain entry. A fire department official said that without knowing the building was being used for housing or concerts, the department would have inspected only once every two years, and that on its most recent visit, it, too, was unable to enter.But some residents of the building questioned the idea that anyone had tried to inspect it. \u201cWe would have known if somebody from the city had come by to advise us about hazards,\u201d said Carmen Brito, who escaped the blaze.\u201cThat place was a tinderbox,\u201d said Danielle Boudreaux, who had visited many times. \u201cAnd anybody who went in there who had any kind of authority should have not allowed it to continue.\u201dBefore the fire thrust Oakland into the national spotlight, officials here had other preoccupations. The city, the most crime-ridden in California, has had six police chiefs in seven years, and remains without a permanent one after a scandal involving officers having sex with a young prostitute rocked the city government this summer.Code violations were not at the forefront of the officials\u2019 concerns.Oakland officials said the city takes illegal housing seriously, but there are so many informally converted spaces that building inspectors, firefighters and the police are overwhelmed by the problem. California law says that an inspector cannot enter unless admitted by an owner or resident, and officials say that people often refuse to let inspectors in, fearing eviction.What we know about the interior of the building that burned down on Friday.Fruitvale, the neighborhood where the Ghost Ship was located, is a dense grid of old industrial structures, houses and apartment buildings, populated mostly by Latino immigrants. It is well trafficked both by commuters headed to other parts of the Bay Area and by prostitutes who stand along the sidewalks of International Boulevard.The Ghost Ship was run by a married couple, Derick Ion Almena \u2014 also known as Derick Ion \u2014 and Micah Allison, whom residents described as the master tenants who rented the building and sublet parts of it to others. The building was owned by Chor Nar Siu Ng, who lives elsewhere in Oakland. It is unclear what Ms. Ng, who could not be reached for comment, knew about conditions inside.Current and former tenants said that when Ms. Ng or her daughter came by, Mr. Almena and Ms. Allison told tenants to pack away bedding and cooking supplies. Justin Manchester, who lived in the building for six weeks in 2014, said that the master tenants told other residents to hide in a nearby Wendy\u2019s restaurant when Ms. Ng visited.\u201cThey would usually prepare for days,\u201d he said, and they would tell tenants to \u201cmake your space look like nobody had been staying there.\u201dMr. Manchester, 25, who now lives in Texas, said that he moved to the Ghost Ship after being evicted from another warehouse known as Sugar Mountain, and that he knew of at least seven warehouses in Oakland, all creatively named, where artists lived under similar conditions, paying below-market rents.The Alameda County authorities took the couple\u2019s three children from them last year, after reports of neglect and unsafe conditions, according to Ms. Allison\u2019s father and a county official. The couple regained custody of the children, now ages 6, 7 and 13, several months later. The Alameda County Social Services agency said it could not comment, so it was unclear whether an inspection of the family\u2019s living arrangements was conducted.Mr. Almena pleaded no contest in January to a misdemeanor charge of receiving stolen property, an Airstream trailer, and was sentenced to three years probation. Some residents described having run-ins with him and accused him of cutting off the electricity of tenants he didn\u2019t like.Ms. Ng, who owns the building and the adjacent lot, bought the property in 1988. County records show that she and her family have owned several properties in Oakland, with a history of building violations that have caused the city to place liens against them.These include at least $1,000 for failure to fix unsafe conditions at a property on Eighth Street, and at least $3,000 for failure to fix conditions at a property on International Boulevard.And in 2007, the city issued liens for at least $6,800 for her failure to address unspecified conditions at 1305 31st Avenue, the property that would become the Ghost Ship. The liens on the building were paid off by 2014.Oakland has seen rents and home prices skyrocket with the local technology boom. Rents are up about 70 percent from five years ago \u2014 the fastest increase in the nation according to Zillow, the online real estate pricing service. The $2,899 median price is now just shy of cities like San Francisco and Manhattan.In Oakland, artists and musicians have long been using industrial warehouses as a cheap way to find a place to live and work in the same space.The paradox is that illegal housing is cheap partly because it is illegal, said Thomas Dolan, an Oakland architect who helps building owners convert warehouses.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a market economy, a gentrifying real estate market and people feeling that they need to go underground,\u201d he said.Julie Turkewitz, Thomas Fuller and Conor Dougherty reported from Oakland, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "Insurance Policies on Slaves: New York Life\u2019s Complicated Past", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "In its 19th-century beginnings, New York Life Insurance sold 508 policies covering slaves. Their descendants are grappling with it.Supported bySales were sluggish that year. So the company looked south.There, in Richmond, Va., an enterprising New York Life agent sold more than 30 policies in a single day in February 1846. Soon, advertisements began appearing in newspapers from Wilmington, N.C., to Louisville as the New York-based company encouraged Southerners to buy insurance to protect their most precious commodity: their slaves.Alive, slaves were among a white man\u2019s most prized assets. Dead, they were considered virtually worthless. Life insurance changed that calculus, allowing slave owners to recoup three-quarters of a slave\u2019s value in the event of an untimely death.James De Peyster Ogden, New York Life\u2019s first president, would later describe the American system of human bondage as \u201cevil.\u201d But by 1847, insurance policies on slaves accounted for a third of the policies in a firm that would become one of the nation\u2019s Fortune 100 companies.Banks absorbed by JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo allowed Southerners seeking loans to use their slaves as collateral and took possession of some of them when their owners defaulted.Like New York Life, Aetna and US Life also sold insurance policies to slave owners, particularly those whose laborers engaged in hazardous work in mines, lumber mills, turpentine factories and steamboats in the industrializing sectors of the South. US Life, a subsidiary of AIG, declined to comment on its slave policy sales. Wachovia, one of Wells Fargo\u2019s predecessor companies, has apologized for its historic ties to slavery as have JPMorgan Chase and Aetna.More than 40 other firms, mostly based in the South, sold such policies, too, though documentation is scarce and most closed their doors generations ago.New York Life survived. Its foray into the slave insurance business did not prove to be lucrative: The company ended up paying out nearly as much in death claims \u2014 about $232,000 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 as it received in annual payments. But in the span of about three years, it sold 508 policies, more than Aetna and US Life combined, according to available records.Now, the descendants of one of those slaves \u2014 who were recently identified by The New York Times \u2014 are coming to terms with the realization that one of the nation\u2019s biggest insurance companies sold policies on their ancestors and hundreds of other enslaved laborers.Policy No. 447 covered Nathan York, a slave who toiled in the Virginia coal mines where the earth often collapsed on its subterranean work force. Policy No. 1141 insured a slave known as Warwick, who fed the fiery furnaces on a Kentucky steamboat. Policy No. 1150 covered Anthony, who labored amid the whirling blades of a sawmill in North Carolina.\u201cWe profoundly regret that in the 1840s our predecessor company, Nautilus Insurance Company, insured the lives of slaves for a brief period of time,\u201d Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the company, said in a written statement. \u201cWhile we cannot change our history, our longstanding recognition of it has helped shape our commitment to the African-American community.\u201dCompany officials allowed The Times to review several ledgers from its archive, but declined to allow a reporter to interview its archivist to determine whether additional records related to the slave policies still exist. The executives said that slave policies generated only about 5 percent of total revenues during the three fiscal years in which the policies were sold. They said the policies proved to be unprofitable and did not drive the company\u2019s growth.\u201cWe can be disturbed by this, but we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Southern companies that benefited from slavery; many Northern institutions also benefited directly or indirectly.\u201dThe advertisement appeared in the Richmond Enquirer on Jan. 29, 1846. It described a new firm offering life insurance for slaves employed in any \u201coccupation where there may be danger or risque.\u201dTheir slaves dug for black ore in underground shafts that oozed deadly gases and shuddered with explosions. Dozens of enslaved African-Americans had died in a blast just seven years earlier, mining records show, a catastrophic financial loss for their white owners.Nicholas Mills, who owned shares in the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, was determined to protect himself from such a calamity. So he purchased policies on more than 20 of his enslaved laborers, including Mr. York, a 40-year-old coal miner and the father of a baby boy.The premiums Mr. Mills paid in the spring of 1846 \u2014 about $7,000 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 flowed into the New York Life office on Wall Street, where employees began recording the names, ages, policy numbers and occupations of the slaves who were insured.New York City\u2019s merchants helped to finance the nation\u2019s premier export crop, cotton, and the purchase of the land and slaves needed to grow it. They controlled the boat companies that shipped the cotton to Europe, leading one Southern editor to describe New York City as \u201calmost as dependent upon Southern slavery as Charleston.\u201d And some of these businessmen assumed prominent positions at New York Life.Mr. De Peyster Ogden, the company\u2019s first president, was a cotton merchant who grew up in a home tended by slaves. He would become a prominent defender of slavery, describing it as an unfortunate, but inextricable part of the nation\u2019s economy.Several wealthy members of the company\u2019s board also opposed efforts to end slavery, including William H. Aspinwall, a builder of the trans-Panama railroad; Schuyler Livingston, the New York representative of Lloyd\u2019s of London; and James Brown, a banker whose firm, Brown Brothers, controlled several plantations in the South. (A board member, Henry W. Hicks, on the other hand, came from a family of abolitionists.)It was no surprise then that New York Life tried to tap into the flood of money pouring into the city from the South. In the beginning, the payments from slaveholders and other customers helped the company generate interest and cover the rent of its Wall Street office ($500 for the first year), the salary of its first president ($500), commissions for agents (roughly 5 to 10 percent of premiums), the fees for the medical doctors who examined the slaves ($2 per exam) and office upkeep like painting, carpeting and postage.The clothbound ledgers, which describe New York Life\u2019s revenues and expenses in spidery script, also document how the company institutionalized the nation\u2019s racial hierarchy.Officials typically insured the lives of white customers for $1,000 to $5,000 in the early years. Slaves, on the other hand, were considered property under the law and were typically insured for about $400, the records show, and some for as little as $200.Payouts from death claims usually went to the grieving relatives of white customers. In the case of slaves, however, it was the slave owners \u2014 who insured their laborers and paid the annual premiums \u2014 who collected.Abraham S. Wooldridge, a mining magnate and business partner of Mr. Mills, praised the company\u2019s swift response after two of his slaves perished on the job.\u201cThe insurance was promptly paid,\u201d Mr. Wooldridge said in an advertisement published by the Richmond Whig newspaper in 1847. \u201cI have entire confidence in the solvency and fair dealing of the company.\u201dAs the death claims mounted, New York Life\u2019s board voted on April 19, 1848, to discontinue the sale of slave policies. It would take about six years for the last slave policies to lapse.But the names of the slaves remained inscribed in accounting books that moved from one office to the next as the company grew, handwritten clues that would link the past to the present.Ms. Ross, a retired public health scientist, prayed at First Baptist just as her parents, grandparents and great-grandparents did before her. She knew the names of the founding members by heart.Ms. Ross\u2019s great-great-grandfather was Mr. York, a founding member of her church and one of the hundreds of slaves whose lives were insured by New York Life.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ms. Ross, who is 66 and had researched the family histories of several church members, but not her own. \u201cYou have just opened my eyes.\u201dMs. Ross worked in New York City in the mid-1970s and never dreamed that one of the city\u2019s insurance companies had tried to profit from her ancestor\u2019s enslavement. \u201cI think it was pathetic that they used the labor, the hard work, blood, sweat and tears of the slaves\u201d to help their business, she said.Even so, she considers herself lucky. Her great-great grandfather survived his time as an enslaved miner. After the Civil War, Mr. York continued digging for coal and earned enough money to buy land and cattle. He helped to establish a school for newly freed slaves and became the patriarch of a sprawling family.Others were less fortunate. The stone ruins of the Grove Shaft building, the remains of the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, are only a short drive from Ms. Ross\u2019s home. Whenever she visits, she prays for the enslaved miners who never made it home.Godfrey, a 50-year-old slave who was also insured by New York Life, died in a fire in Midlothian on Nov. 20, 1847.\u201cBurned to death,\u201d reads the entry in the company\u2019s accounting of the dead.The insurance clerks on Wall Street did not record Godfrey\u2019s last name or the location of his burial place.

These voters trusted his promise to bring back good manufacturing jobs while disbelieving his much more credible promise to take away their health care. They have a rude shock coming.But white workers aren\u2019t alone in their gullibility: Corporate America is still in denial about the prospects for a global trade war, even though protectionism was a central theme of the Trump campaign. In fact, the only two causes about which Mr. Trump seems truly passionate are supposedly unfair trade deals and admiration for authoritarian regimes. It\u2019s na\u00efve to assume that he\u2019ll let his signature policy issue slide.Let\u2019s talk means, motive and consequences.You might imagine that a drastic change in U.S. trade policy would require congressional approval, and that Republicans \u2014 who claim to believe in free markets \u2014 would put on the brakes. But given G.O.P. spinelessness, that\u2019s unlikely.Why would a Trump administration impose restrictions on imports? One answer is those working-class voters, whose supposed champion is set to pursue a radically antiworker domestic agenda. There\u2019s an obvious incentive for Mr. Trump to make a big show of doing something to fulfill campaign promises. And if this creates international conflict, that\u2019s actually a plus when it comes to diverting attention from collapsing health care and so on.So what will happen when the Trump tariffs come?And retaliation isn\u2019t the whole story; there\u2019s also emulation. Once America decides that the rules don\u2019t apply, world trade will become a free-for-all.An old joke tells of a motorist who runs over a pedestrian, then tries to fix the damage by backing up \u2014 and runs over the victim a second time. Well, the effects of the Trumpist trade war on U.S. workers will be a lot like that.No, the best bet is that the trade war is coming. Buckle your seatbelts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italian Parliament Approves New Government, for Now", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byAddressing lawmakers ahead of the votes, Mr. Gentiloni said that his government \u2014 deridingly described by the opposition as a \u201cphotocopy\u201d of Mr. Renzi\u2019s because nearly all the ministers were the same \u2014 would last \u201cas long as it has the confidence of Parliament,\u201d setting out an ambitious and wide-ranging agenda.\u201cOur work agenda will be crammed,\u201d he said. Among his short-term priorities, he listed supporting Italy\u2019s ailing banking sector and assisting the population of central Italian towns ravaged by earthquakes this year.In the long term, the government would focus on Italy\u2019s struggling southern regions and on improving the country\u2019s economy. In a nod to the troubling unemployment rate, particularly in the south, \u201cThe priority of priorities is \u2018work, work, work,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gentiloni told lawmakers in the lower house on Tuesday.But whether there would be a long term for his government was an open question.On Tuesday, Mr. Gentiloni easily won the vote in the lower house, with 368 votes in favor and 105 against, while his support in the 315-seat Senate on Wednesday was slimmer, with 169 senators in favor and 99 against, an early indicator of the rough road before him.Even with a government in place, the political uncertainty that followed Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation after voters resoundingly rejected his overhauls last week has only barely abated. Political debate this week danced mostly around a single question: How long will the Gentiloni government last?\u201cThis is the big question, and frankly no one knows,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of contemporary history at Luiss University in Rome. \u201cThere is an enormous margin of ambiguity\u201d when it comes to the parties that could support the government, he said, describing \u201ca variable geometry\u201d of political forces with their own agendas.In the wake of the referendum, which voters rejected by a margin of 59 percent to 41 percent, opposition parties called for early elections, interpreting the defeat as a rejection of Mr. Renzi\u2019s leadership and policies.The anti-establishment Five Star Movement \u2014 which made significant political inroads this year, winning key mayoral races in Rome and Turin \u2014 has been particularly vocal in clamoring for immediate elections to capitalize on its success as a protagonist of the campaign against the referendum.But some political analysts suggest that even Mr. Renzi is in a hurry to return to the polls, to capitalize on the portion of the population that voted for the overhauls.Mr. Gentiloni\u2019s future in part \u201cdepends on Renzi\u2019s haste to conquer government again,\u201d said Gianfranco Pasquino, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Bologna.But there is one considerable stumbling block to early elections, ahead of the natural end of the legislation in February 2018.The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, has made clear that elections cannot be held until a new electoral law is drafted for the lower house. The current law, which was passed last year, is under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court. A ruling is expected in early 2017.A different law is applied in Senate elections, and Mr. Mattarella has indicated that he would like the two laws to match.Mr. Gentiloni pledged that his government would shepherd and solicit new rules for the polls, but he made it clear that it was up to Parliament to draft the electoral laws.In asking lawmakers to vote for him, Mr. Gentiloni told senators Wednesday that his government would \u201ccomplete the exceptional activity of reform, innovation and modernization that has been undertaken in recent years.\u201dBut Mr. Orsina said that the government was destined to \u201cplay it by ear,\u201d and that at least initially its energy would be focused on urgent matters, like helping to recapitalize Italy\u2019s third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is trying to raise money from private investors in order not to fail.Long-term initiatives were not likely, at first, \u201cbecause the government\u2019s durability is not assured,\u201d he said.Pointing out that Italy had many international appointments on its agenda \u2014 including the 60th anniversary in late March of the Treaty of Rome, which led to the creation of the European Economic Community \u2014 Mr. Pasquino was more optimistic.\u201cWith some luck, and as long as it doesn\u2019t make mistakes, the government could even make it to the end of the legislature\u201d in 2018, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2017 Infiniti QX30 AWD", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byDrivenAUTOMAKERS are in the business of manufacturing cars. But as with any company, it\u2019s really all about making money. And because every new model is a gamble, car companies need every advantage possible.That includes cooperating with one another.To save resources and operate more nimbly, automakers occasionally hook up. It can be as simple as BMW using automatic transmissions engineered by General Motors. Or maybe it\u2019s Toyota selling a Mazda 2, with new fascias, as the Yaris iA. Sharing happens.Infiniti\u2019s new hatchbacklike crossover, the QX30, doesn\u2019t use a powertrain or platform from the parts bin of its parent company, Nissan. Instead, the chassis structure, suspension, 2-liter 208-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder engine and 7-speed dual clutch gearbox all come from Germany. It is a result of the partnership that Daimler (you know, the Mercedes-Benz people) formed with Renault-Nissan in 2010.Think of the Infiniti QX30 and Mercedes GLA 250 as brothers from different mothers. For Infiniti, adapting from the Mercedes vehicle meant reducing the strain on the company\u2019s engineers, bringing the QX30 more quickly to market. It was a good strategy, because very small crossovers are a big deal.Infiniti didn\u2019t just slap new badges and a different grille on the GLA. Other than some interior switches, there are few clues to the QX\u2019s origins.The striking brushstroked sheet metal is pure Infiniti swoopiness down to the signature \u201ccrescent cut\u2019\u2019 flourish all Infinitis have on their rear roof pillar.In an era when safety regulations, aerodynamic considerations and blatant copying have made it harder to distinguish cars by design, the QX30\u2019s stylists deserve kudos. The cocoonlike cabin appears richer than its Teutonic sibling, especially in the optional Cafe Teak package (which uses real wood, although not teak).The heated seats use Nissan\u2019s Zero Gravity contouring that follows the curvature of a human spine in weightless conditions. They are comfy without having to leave Earth. Infiniti made this platform theirs by changing the suspension tuning, steering, throttle response and transmission calibration. A quick test drive proves how different the two cars feel. Driving the GLA, I found the transmission dynamics lethargic in economy mode and over-caffeinated in the sport setting, with no middle ground.The QX30 achieves a happy medium. It dashes from a metered on-ramp light to 60 miles an hour in just under seven seconds. At speed, the QX30 cruises well for a small vehicle. There is a button-down manner on the straightaways and quelled road noise. Choose between three QX30 models: a standard version, Sport (lowered by 0.6 inches) and all-wheel drive (raised 1.2 inches from the base version). Across the board, the suspensions are firmer than the GLA\u2019s. All-wheel-drive models have a higher center of gravity, so the steering ratio is slowed. If cornering is your thing, consider the front-drive Sport.My week with an all-wheel-drive model coincided with a rare blanket of snow covering Seattle. The QX30 happily crawled up and down my hilly neighborhood (remember, snow tires on a front-drive vehicle are a revelation). This rig is fine for the light off-roading that a few owners might point it toward.As with the GLA, checking your left blind spot reveals little but a face full of pillar. Highly recommended is the $2,200 Technology Package with blind-spot warning, auto braking and semiautonomous parking.Rear seating is acceptable but snug in all dimensions for an average adult, with seat backs fixed a tad too upright for my taste. The cargo hold takes on a half-dozen grocery bags. Drop the split rear seat, complete with ski pass-through, and it gobbles up a bike with the front wheel removed.The QX30 starts at $30,945 for a base front-drive car; with options \u2014 including $540 lighted sill plates \u2014 my Premium AWD copy was listed at $46,035.Near as I can figure, that is $4,000 less than a comparably equipped Mercedes GLA 250. Compare these two with Audi Q3, BMW X1, Lexus NX and maybe, for the budget-minded, the Buick Encore.The Buick, by the way, is a product of South Korea, built by the former Daewoo Motors, which General Motors purchased. Just another example of how the industry is deeply intertwined.videovideovideovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Jobs Numbers Signal the End of an Economic Era", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byJobs ReportIn the book of United States economic history, the November jobs numbers released on Friday would make a fitting end to a particularly long, terrifying chapter that began nine years ago.The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent, the Labor Department said, from 4.9 percent. The last time it was this low was August 2007. That was the month, you may recall, when global money markets first froze up because of losses on United States mortgage-related bonds: early tremors of what would become a recession four months later and a global financial crisis nine months after that.In the last nine years, we\u2019ve witnessed events in economic, financial and political history so convulsive that our 2007 selves wouldn\u2019t have been able to imagine them. But while the political future may be more uncertain than ever, the economic and financial outlook is getting mercifully boring again.After all, not only is the 4.6 percent unemployment rate consistent with what economists consider full employment, but bond markets, following a sell-off that began after Election Day, are now priced to reflect a return to more normal interest rates than had seemed probable just a month ago. The Federal Reserve appears likely to raise interest rates when its policy committee meets in less than two weeks.In truth, the details of the new jobs numbers are more uneven than the drop in the unemployment rate would suggest. Part of the decline was caused by 226,000 people dropping out of the labor force (there were also 160,000 more people who reported themselves as employed, so the decline in joblessness was for a mix of bad and good reasons).Millions of working-age people, especially men, are neither working nor looking for work, which remains the lingering weak spot in the United States economy and is most likely a factor in Americans\u2019 continued dissatisfaction with the economy (and their votes for Donald J. Trump for president).Moreover, some progress toward higher wages reported in the October jobs numbers was partly reversed, with an 0.1 percent fall in average hourly earnings for private-sector workers. Still, the 2.5 percent gain in that wage measure over the last year represents real income gains in a time of low inflation. And the silver lining of softer wage growth is that it will make the Fed more inclined to be patient in raising rates by diminishing the central bank\u2019s inflation fears.While the 178,000 jobs the United States added in November were consistent with projections, the combination of a low unemployment rate and a stable-or-shrinking labor force implies that the economy won\u2019t be able to keep that up for long. If employment gains are going to continue at that pace, it will have to be because more Americans join the work force.The pool of people who formally count as unemployed \u2014 those who say they want a job and have looked for one in the last month \u2014 is down to 7.4 million, the lowest since November 2007. To keep up that speedy job growth, employers will need to pull in people who don\u2019t fit that definition but who are able and willing to work.The economy isn\u2019t perfect; it never is. But Mr. Trump will be inheriting an economy largely healed from its trauma of the last nine years, and with most indicators pointing in the right direction. Everyone can hope that the next chapter in that economic history of the United States will be a more boring one than the last.Advertisement"}

Sadly one night my biggest fear came to a reality \u2026\u201d  \u201cI can relate (I being born a girl and identifying as a boy) whenever I go somewhere that has a male and female bathroom I avoid going to the bathroom altogether.\u201d_________Thoughtful Questions and Observations\u201cWhy do you feel that we cannot get rid of racism?\u201d\u201cIs it fair to prevent good people from getting a chance at a better life because a select few are dangerous?\u201d\u201cDoes anyone have realistic ideas for how the federal government can reform school in a positive way?\u201d\u201cOne big problem: I don\u2019t see too many people commenting on is what is the best clean energy alternative.\u201d _________Citations of Evidence and Sources\u201cAfter doing extensive research, I came across a study conducted by John McLaren and Gihoon Hong that proved that \u2026\u201d\u201cI respectfully disagree with the idea that Donald Trump could improve our immigration crisis if he becomes president. He has said the wall will cost around $10 - $12 billion, however according to The Washington Post Checker, the wall will end up costing around $25 billion.\u201d\u201cWhere did Hillary Clinton say these quotes?\u201d \u201cYou do a good job of explaining your stance, but would benefit by using a resource that proves that climate change was not caused by humans. Citing your sources can be more powerful than citing your opinion.\u201d\u201cEveryone has the right to have their own belief on abortion. However, researching the topic a little more definitely wouldn\u2019t hurt your case. I would say you exaggerated a little much on the way the abortion happens.\u201d_________Open-Minded AttitudesOne example comes from the forum on guns. A student ended her comment this way:\u201cBut that\u2019s my very Northeast, liberal, guns-aren\u2019t-a-part-of-my-life point of view, which I understand is different from many parts of the country. People for whom guns are an important part of daily life/feeling safe, how do you suggest we bring the numbers of homicides, suicides, and mass shootings down without restricting access to guns?\u201dAnother student then wrote back:\u201cI\u2019m also coming from a very North(west), liberal, guns-aren\u2019t-a-part-of-my-life point of view. Because of that, I felt content as I read through your comment. Near the end I almost resumed my casual scrolling through other responses when I saw your last paragraph.It sparked an epiphany: not enough people acknowledge their biases and, like you did here, directly ask the other party what they think is the best choice. In fact, most people forget that the middle ground of wanting to decrease tragedies like shootings, suicides, homicides, and et cetera even exists. In order for this debate to produce positive results, individuals need to familiarize themselves with compromise. I appreciate seeing that here at the end of your response.\u201d\u201cThe topic of immigration is so controversial. My opinions on it were flimsy until I read the Humans Of New York Facebook page. The photographer interviewed countless amounts of Syrian immigrants, and they had a chance to tell their story. All you hear about on the news is about how horrible immigrants are, and I had never thought about it being much different. Once I read their stories, though, it became such a moral issue.\u201dA notable number took both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton seriously and went to their websites to find and quote statements. They then seemed to be trying to puzzle out their own beliefs, rather than just regurgitating canned partisan arguments they had heard elsewhere:\u201cNorton, I can confidently say that I strongly agree with your statement of the hypocrisy in the situation. People do not realize their self contradiction when they say people are discriminated against but do the same towards others. For example I have heard of people being against Hillary Clinton simply because she is a woman. It is also important to note that police officers risk their lives every day to keep us safe, as you said. In addition, as shown by the recent killings of police officers, people are stereotyping police officers for being racist killers; this is obvious proof of hypocrisy in some advocates of the Black lives Matter movement.\u201d\u201cI agree with you in part, Jai, but i must say, crossing the border without permission is wrong, and they knew it. but i do understand that the conditions that the illegal immigrants may have lived in before attempting to cross the border might have been horrendous. there is no correct answer in my opinion, for the matter at hand. you either make them wait for a better life that may never happen, or they find other ways to come here to live a better life \u2026\u201d_________Evidence of Listening to and Supporting OthersRegion often seemed to play a role in students\u2019 points of view, and that may have been most clear in the guns forum. For example, some rural students stood up for gun rights, including one from Vermont:\u201cFor people like me, guns are part of your life. For most New Englanders, guns are used for hunting, whether it is a necessity to survive, or for sport.\u201d A handful of international students also posted, and many Americans seemed to appreciate it when they did:\u201cTy, as an American in the midst of this hotly debated topic, I think hearing a voice from abroad is crucial in dealing with this issue.\u201d\u201cHenry, I see where you are coming from when you express your distaste toward guns. \u2026 Your argument about not letting humans have guns is very good and I would be on board with this idea, but it is not practical. I say it is not practical because there will always be a way for people to obtain guns if they truly wanted them.\u201d\u201cI understand your frustration with illegal immigrants Sam, but I think the word illegal is what is really standing in your way of being compassionate here.\u201d\u201cSarah, your comment on the production of methane gases from cows is commonly overlooked.\u201d \u201cAnnabel, I did not know that you were a legal immigrant. I can see how it would hurt to have people against immigrants.\u201d_________Maturity of Thought and Language\u201cThe past couple weeks I read and analyzed a letter written by James Baldwin in 1962 in my english class, a time that we would consider racial injustice more of a violent and obvious issue. But I don\u2019t see many differences between the fear our citizens feel today and stand in awe with how much of this letter is still relevant to the problems we see today.\u201dThe most popular topic? Abortion. But students also brought up the economy, vaccines, the drinking age, Iran, the death penalty, space exploration, robots, education, college tuition, National Security Agency surveillance, drones, health care, respect for the national anthem, and the legalization of marijuana.As one student noted, all of these could have been better discussed by the candidates themselves:\u201cOne thing during this election season is that no one seems to be bringing up different issues it\u2019s always the same topics over and over, I want to see something new let them talk about how they are going to combat climate change. Or how they are going to approach police corruption and the abuse of power. Insted it feels like all we hear about is ISIS and immigration which are both pressing issues in your country but they are not the only issues. I find it hard to elect a president when i have only heard their views on three subjects.\u201d_________ \u201cIf we look to Sweden, according to muslimstatistics.com, the total Muslim refugee population in Sweden is around 4.4%. They assumed that roughly 2% would be refugee men, and police have confirmed that this 2% of men have cause nearly 77.6% of the rape in the country in the past couple years alone. This is why I do not feel safe with the United States bringing thousands of refugees into our country.\u201dYour students posted intelligent comments, asked thoughtful questions, engaged with a range of others\u2019 opinions across forums, and unfailingly modeled the exact kind of civil, productive discussion we were hoping to have here. Please contact us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, because we\u2019d love to know what happened behind the scenes to result in such powerful student work.Now, on to our individual honorees.The most outstanding participant across forums was, without a doubt, someone who identifies herself as Annabelle from Princeton.I would like to hear other people\u2019s opinions towards legalizing weed. On one hand, I support the legalization because of its lack of harmful physical effects, its prevalence, and the high rates of incarceration that stem from its use. But on the other hand, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand the negative effects it can have. I have friends whose curiosity has been stamped out of them by frequent smoking, who have given up other hobbies and interests, who seem to be in a perpetual cloud of haziness because they\u2019re always stoned or thinking about when they can next get stoned. I know that\u2019s not the case for all people, but I\u2019m wondering if you think legalization will make it more or less of a problem with teenagers. Will it be legal for teens? Will there still be legal penalties for teens caught selling/smoking weed? How can we make sure that legalization will not lead to more teens coming to school stoned, and letting it influence their lives in negative ways?We would also like to honor some individual students.Fiona A.

He was 85.The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, announced his death but did not give the cause or say where he died.As president of the Bundesbank from 1993 until 1999, Mr. Tietmeyer was the most powerful central banker in Europe and a leading advocate of policies that prized price stability above all else. But in contrast to some of his more dogmatic predecessors, he was also known as a politically savvy pragmatist capable of compromise.Mr. Tietmeyer played a leading role in the years of negotiations that preceded the euro. He was among those insisting that countries joining the new currency union should be held to strict spending limits, and that the European Central Bank\u2019s top priority should be to contain inflation.After the Bundesbank and other central banks in the eurozone ceded power over monetary policy to the European Central Bank in 1999, Mr. Tietmeyer remained a visible and influential speaker and commentator. In a 2004 book, \u201cHerausforderung Euro\u201d (\u201cThe Euro Challenge\u201d), he lamented that many countries \u2014 including Germany \u2014 had violated the spending limits he had worked so hard to establish.His views seemed to be vindicated in 2010, when the government of Greece was discovered to have systematically concealed its runaway public debt, provoking a crisis that nearly destroyed the euro and remains a source of tension.Mr. Tietmeyer was born on Aug. 18, 1931, in Metelen, a village northwest of M\u00fcnster close to Germany\u2019s border with the Netherlands. He was one of 11 children of Helene and Bernhard Tietmeyer, a financial inspector for the local government. There was no immediate word on his survivors.When he completed secondary school in 1952, Mr. Tietmeyer initially studied Roman Catholic theology. But after three semesters he switched to economics and went on to earn a doctorate from the University of Cologne in 1960. At the same time, he became expert at table tennis, winning medals at national championships.In 1962, Mr. Tietmeyer took a post at the West German Ministry of Economics, beginning a long career in Civil Service, often in jobs that involved coordinating economic policy with other European countries.As European leaders were beginning to discuss the idea of a common currency, Mr. Tietmeyer, in 1982, became a state secretary in the Finance Ministry, a position just below the minister. The job included responsibility for issues related to what was then known as the European Community. In that role, he became a close adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preparing for West German participation in international summits.Mr. Tietmeyer was powerful enough to become a target of terrorists. In 1988, members of the far-left Red Army Faction fired at his Mercedes-Benz outside Bonn, striking the car numerous times but leaving Mr. Tietmeyer and his driver uninjured.Mr. Kohl\u2019s government nominated Mr. Tietmeyer to the Bundesbank\u2019s board in 1990, and he became president three years later.After his retirement from the Bundesbank, he remained something of a spiritual godfather to German economists and policy makers who have insisted \u2014 to much international criticism \u2014 that fiscal austerity is the cure for countries, like Greece, with too much government debt.\u201cMonetary stability is not everything,\u201d Mr. Tietmeyer said in a 2008 speech, \u201cbut without it there is nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Louis Harris, Pollster at Forefront of American Trends, Dies at 95", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byLouis Harris, the nation\u2019s best-known 20th-century pollster, who refined interpretive polling methods and took the pulse of voters and consumers through four decades of elections, wars, racial troubles and cultural revolutions that ran from tail fins to the internet, died on Saturday at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 95.His death was confirmed by a grandson, Zachary Louis Harris.From the 1950s, when he founded Louis Harris & Associates, until he retired in the early 1990s, Mr. Harris with remarkable accuracy forecast the elections of presidents, governors, members of Congress and scores of other public officials. Along the way, he used polls to sharpen their images, change their speech patterns and focus their attention on issues of interest to voters.He told companies how to market products and services, and conducted polls for industry groups, religious organizations, colleges, unions, banks and government agencies.He also documented trends in American life, from the women\u2019s movement and the ups and downs of the economy to evolving attitudes about marriage, religion, the arts and countless other matters.He preferred to be called a public-opinion analyst rather than a pollster, a word that he believed trivialized what he did, which went beyond gathering data into new realms of interpretation \u2014 useful to clients of his consulting firm and more meaningful to millions who watched his analyses on the CBS and ABC television networks or who read his nationally syndicated newspaper and magazine columns.His results were sometimes wrong. And critics questioned his early practice of using his polls to promote candidates \u2014 notably John F. Kennedy in his 1960 presidential race \u2014 for whom he worked as a campaign strategist. But he gave up political advocacy after a few years to concentrate on public polling and analyses for the newspaper and television jobs that made him a household name in America.In the 1960s, he developed television\u2019s ability to project national election winners on the basis of early returns after polls closed in the East. But critics said projections before the polls closed in the West discouraged some voters from casting ballots, and the networks voluntarily ended the practice.Mr. Harris denied that his work affected the outcome of elections or corrupted voting processes. He rejected charges that he was too commercial, although he made a fortune in market research. And he scoffed at accusations that his polls reflected a liberal Democratic bias; he said he often worked for Republicans and was guided by principles of fairness and accuracy.Like Elmo Roper and George Gallup, his pioneering predecessors, Mr. Harris plumbed attitudes with face-to-face interviews, using carefully worded questions put by trained interviewers to subjects selected as part of a group that was chosen as demographically representative of the nation. (Telephone interviews, faster and less expensive, came into wide use in the late 1970s, and proved to be just as valid.)But the Harris methods were more sophisticated than those of Mr. Roper, a Depression- and World War II-era researcher, who first developed scientific polling techniques, and who was a mentor to Mr. Harris early in his career.Mr. Harris phrased questions to better understand what people really thought. He did not seek simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers; his criteria for picking representative subjects were more precise, and his analyses of data were more meaningful. And unlike Dr. Gallup, who refused to conduct private polls for politicians, Mr. Harris embraced political advocacy early in his career.In 1956, after nearly a decade as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and partner of Mr. Roper, he founded Louis Harris & Associates. The bulk of the company\u2019s early work was market research for concerns like Johnson & Johnson, American Airlines, Standard Oil and the New York Stock Exchange.But his work drew the attention of the syndicated columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop, and an avalanche of political work ensued. Over seven years, Mr. Harris worked for Democratic and Republican candidates in 214 campaigns in all 50 states, including 45 of 100 United States senators and half the nation\u2019s governors.His most prominent client was John Kennedy, who hired him in 1958 to help his Senate re-election campaign. A year later, Mr. Harris helped persuade him to run for president, and became a key strategist, advising him to discuss his Roman Catholicism openly and take a stand on civil rights. Preparing for debates with Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Harris urged the youthful-looking Kennedy to give three-part answers to every question to promote an image of maturity, and advised him to slow his rapid speech to project a warmer personality.He fit in nicely with the Kennedy crowd: A ruggedly handsome, athletic man with a square jaw and a high forehead, he shared the clan\u2019s fascination with politics and its comfortable blend of intelligence, wit and charm. He and Kennedy had both been in the wartime Navy, loved to swim and were at home on a beach or a sailboat, and they were both good at winning the trust of strangers.Mr. Harris also worked on campaigns for Mayor Robert F. Wagner of New York, Senator Frank Church of Idaho, Senators John Sherman Cooper and Thruston B. Morton of Kentucky and many others. In 1962, he helped Gov. Edmund G. Brown defeat Nixon in the California governor\u2019s race.By 1963, however, Mr. Harris had given up political advocacy to become a syndicated columnist and a public-opinion analyst for CBS News. Besides polling and appearing on the air, he developed Voter Profile Analysis, a model of national and state voting patterns by ethnic, religious and economic blocs that he used to predict election results with astonishing success, starting in 1964.From 1963 to 1968, Mr. Harris wrote syndicated columns for The Washington Post and Newsweek, and from 1969 to 1988 he wrote for The Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News Syndicate. His columns appeared in more than 100 newspapers. He wrote for Time magazine from 1969 to 1972. He later shifted his TV commentaries to ABC News.Harris polls often made news. One in 1974 found that the Republicans could not hold the White House unless Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal. In 1980 he foretold Ronald Reagan\u2019s election as president, and in 1990 he found that President George Bush might not be re-elected. (He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992.) Harris surveys on the attitudes of black and white people became landmarks in race relations.His books, on politics, racial issues and national trends, included \u201cIs There a Republican Majority?\u201d (1954), \u201cThe Negro Revolution in America\u201d (1964, with William Brink), \u201cBlack and White\u201d (1967), \u201cBlack-Jewish Relations in New York City: The Anguish of Change\u201d (1973) and \u201cInside America\u201d (1987).Louis Harris & Associates was sold to the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1969, and again to Gannett in 1975. Despite the ownership changes, Mr. Harris continued as chief executive until he retired in 1992. In 1996, a merger of Louis Harris & Associates and the Gordon S. Black Corporation produced Harris Interactive, a global market research company based in Rochester and New York City.Humphrey Taylor, chairman of Harris Interactive\u2019s Harris Poll, who was Mr. Harris\u2019s deputy for years and his successor at Louis Harris & Associates, called Mr. Harris \u201ca true original, who pushed the envelope beyond any of his predecessors in the design and use of surveys.\u201dMr. Harris was born on Jan. 6, 1921, in New Haven, one of three children of Harry Harris, a real estate developer, and the former Frances Smith.He became interested in politics and journalism in high school, and after graduating in 1938 attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After earning a degree in economics in 1942, he joined the Navy and became a junior officer on patrol boats in the North Atlantic.In 1943, he married Florence Yard. She died in 2004. He is survived by their children, Peter, Richard and Susan Yard Harris, and four grandchildren.Mr. Harris ran his first poll in 1945. Stationed at Boston, he was asked by the Navy to determine if sailors there were being treated properly. He found that morale was low, and that sailors felt neglected by the Navy and exploited by the local citizenry.After a year as a researcher with a veterans\u2019 organization, Mr. Harris went to work for Mr. Roper in 1947. He wrote his boss\u2019s newspaper columns and radio scripts until 1951, when he became a partner, concentrating on political research. He left Roper five years later to form his own polling organization.In a 2009 interview, Mr. Harris defended his efforts to influence political decisions.\u201cThe key is \u2014 and this I feel more deeply than anything else,\u201d he said, \u201cIf you know what people are trying to say, and it\u2019s something that may save the country if the people running it know about it, can do something about it, then you have a deep obligation, a moral obligation, to take what they have said, and get to know the people that can do something about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Dire Need for Engineers Is Going Unmet", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byMemo From IndonesiaJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Like many college students, Abdul Hamid is not thinking too much about life after graduation.After all, Mr. Hamid, 20, is only in his sophomore year at the Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University, outside Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. He spends his days at the university\u2019s Faculty of Islamic Theology, where he majors in comparative religious studies, and his evenings hanging out with friends and listening to music.Pressed about his postcollege plans, Mr. Hamid shrugged and smiled. \u201cInshallah, teaching,\u201d he said, using the Arabic word for \u201cGod willing.\u201d \u201cMost students in my field go on to teach young people at Islamic boarding schools.\u201dBut while that may be an honorable vocation in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation, more religion teachers are not what Indonesia needs, say education experts, economists and business leaders here.They say the country has a shortage of skilled workers \u2014 in fields ranging from medical services to agriculture \u2014 and will need tens of millions more in the coming decades. It particularly needs more engineers, a problem that could thwart President Joko Widodo\u2019s ambitious plans to upgrade Indonesia\u2019s outdated infrastructure.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of professionals where there are problems,\u201d said Christopher Manning, a retired economics professor at Australian National University in Canberra, who has researched Indonesia\u2019s economy for decades. \u201cIf you talk to any multinational corporations, there are questions about managers. There are questions about engineers.\u201dYet of Indonesia\u2019s six million university and postgraduate students, as many as 20 percent are majoring in Islamic studies, according to the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education. And those graduates often don\u2019t find work in their chosen field.\u201cThe problem is quality skills and productivity,\u201d said Eko Prasetyo, president director of the Education Fund Management Institution, an arm of the Indonesian Ministry of Finance that has awarded more than 15,000 postgraduate scholarships since 2013.\u201cWe have to produce more engineers. We have to produce more researchers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be an economy led by natural resources.\u201dAfter President Joko took office in 2014, his administration declared a dozen priority fields of study for state-funded scholarships, including information technology, nursing and tourism. But Mr. Joko, a socially conservative Muslim, included religious studies among those fields, even though it was already a popular choice for students.Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for IHS Economics, which is based in London, said that producing more skilled workers, including engineers and technicians, should be \u201cone of the key strategic priorities for the Indonesian government over the next decade.\u201d\u201cIndonesia is estimated to have an annual shortage of around 30,000 engineering graduates per year, and this is a key hurdle to infrastructure development and the growth of the manufacturing industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Indonesian government needs to give a high priority to developing educational infrastructure to address these skill shortages, including universities for science and engineering as well as technical institutes.\u201dThe country is estimated to have 57 million skilled workers now, and would need 113 million by 2030 based on current growth rates, Mr. Biswas said.The challenge is a daunting one. Fewer than 10 percent of Indonesia\u2019s 250 million people have a university-level education, according to a 2015 national labor force survey conducted by the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau. Most Indonesians who do have university degrees work as teachers, according to data from the Asian Development Bank. Just 8 percent are engineers.Analysts say this imbalance of professional talent is hampering Mr. Joko\u2019s government as he attempts, with great fanfare, to carry out hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of nationwide infrastructure projects, ranging from sea and airports to highways and new power plants.One of his ambitious goals is to create an additional 35,000 megawatts of electricity supply through new coal-fired plants by 2019, a big stretch that is now in its second year. But there is apprehension among business leaders about whether the government can pull it off.\u201cWhen they enter the construction phase, they will face this shortage of engineers. The question becomes: Where do those engineers come from?\u201d said Heru Dewanto, president director of Cirebon Power, which operates six power plants in West Java Province and is building a seventh.More than half of the engineering graduates produced by Indonesia go on to careers in other fields, like banking, said Mr. Heru, who is vice president of the Institution of Engineers Indonesia. \u201cWhy? Because those jobs provide better incomes,\u201d he said.The same is true of graduates in many areas, including Islamic studies. Ainun Na\u2019im, secretary general of the higher education ministry, said nearly half of Islamic studies graduates ended up in occupations unrelated to religion, like communications and public relations. And Indonesian graduates in a variety of fields take unrelated jobs not because they pay more, but because they cannot find work in their chosen profession.\u201cThis occurs when, for example, a university graduate qualifies to be an accountant but can\u2019t find a job in that area, so rather than be unemployed they become a taxi driver,\u201d said Emma R. Allen, a country economist for the Asian Development Bank in Jakarta.Such \u201chigh levels of mismatch are typically associated with weak labor productivity growth and slow transition to higher-value activities throughout the economy,\u201d Ms. Allen said.The problems with the country\u2019s educational system go deep. Just 43 percent of Indonesians have completed primary school, according to the government\u2019s statistics bureau. A June study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that looked at 34 countries found that Indonesians working in Jakarta scored last in literacy, numeracy and problem solving.The situation is improving. For instance, in 2015, 57 percent of Indonesians who finished primary school went on to continue their studies, compared with 40 percent in 2002, according to government figures. And the proportion of college-age Indonesians attending universities has risen to 25 percent from 20 percent in the past decade. But analysts say much more is needed.\u201cIn terms of quantity, that\u2019s a lot of achievement,\u201d said Sutarum Wiryono, an education senior project officer at the Asian Development Bank. \u201cBut in terms of quality, it is not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No New Local Zika Transmissions in Florida, Governor Says", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byMIAMI \u2014 Four months after Zika roiled Miami-Dade County and put the rest of Florida on alert, Gov. Rick Scott announced on Friday that mosquitoes were no longer actively transmitting the virus in South Florida.Shortly after the announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted its strictest advisory urging pregnant women not to travel to the heart of South Beach, a popular tourism destination. Instead it suggested caution.\u201cOur state has no more local transmission of Zika,\u201d Mr. Scott said at a news conference outside a South Beach hotel.The federal health warning for South Beach was one of four issued for neighborhoods in Miami and Miami Beach, beginning Aug. 1 in Wynwood, which reported the first case of active Zika in the continental United States. Federal health officials can remove a travel advisory after an area goes 45 days without two or more reported cases of locally acquired Zika.The lifting of the advisory came as the state swings into peak tourism season. It offers a respite from a crisis that walloped two of the county\u2019s most popular destinations \u2014 Miami Beach and Wynwood, a gentrifying area of galleries and hipster hangouts. The crisis also sent local and state officials scrambling to blunt the spread of the virus, test anxious pregnant women, reassure tourists and allay the concerns of residents and businesses. In the end, hotels and other businesses took a short-term hit.The number of locally transmitted Zika cases in the Miami area has dropped sharply, a result of both the county\u2019s aggressive control efforts and the weather. Winter here brings the end of the rainy season and slightly lower temperatures, making it more difficult for the disease-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito to survive. Isolated cases will continue to pop up.\u201cThe virus is endemic; it\u2019s here now,\u201d said Chalmers Vasquez, Miami-Dade County\u2019s mosquito control manager. \u201cBut we have a good picture of what we are dealing with the next mosquito outbreak.\u201dTo try to stay ahead of the mosquitoes, the county has teams applying larvicide through the winter, inspecting properties and checking 63 traps to keep tabs on mosquito counts, said Paul Mauriello, deputy director for solid waste management for the county. The county hopes to double the number of traps in the next few weeks. Aedes aegypti eggs can survive the winter by sticking to the sides of containers, mosquito officials said.The rest of South Florida is also watching closely. In the Florida Keys, where Monroe County voters approved the release of genetically modified mosquitoes in a nonbinding referendum, Oxitec, a British biotech firm, is hoping to release its mosquitoes next year. Oxitec was embroiled in a long fight with residents of a tiny suburb of Key West called Key Haven \u2014 the designated site for the mosquitoes\u2019 release.Concerned about the new technology, voters there rejected the plan in a separate referendum, scratching the project after it had received the approval of the Food and Drug Administration. Now the Keys mosquito control board commission is scouting new locations on the chain of islands and Oxitec is holding discussion with the federal agency about the changes, said Oxitec\u2019s senior scientist, Derric Nimmo.For pregnant women Zika can be a much bigger problem because they can pass the virus on to their fetuses, which can trigger serious brain abnormalities. Zika\u2019s arrival in Florida prompted widespread apprehension in Miami. Some women moved out of state. Others left the house covered from neck to toe. Mr. Scott announced that pregnant women could receive free Zika testing, a generous offer but one that also caused considerable logjams and delays.Dr. Christine Curry, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Miami Health System, said two women in Florida have given birth to babies with either microcephaly or other Zika-related problems. But the university\u2019s Zika response team continues to treat pregnant women.\u201cThe majority don\u2019t have a recollection of symptoms or mosquito bites and are surprised the antibody test came back positive,\u201d Dr. Curry said.Zika\u2019s arrival also hurt businesses in affected areas and tourism on Miami Beach, at least in the first three months. No neighborhood was more affected than Wynwood \u2014 where the first case was reported \u2014 which bore the brunt of a steep learning curve about the virus that the state and county faced in fighting the mosquitoes and the disease.A one-square mile area of Wynwood was declared an active transmission zone, even though a handful of cases were reported and urban Aedes aegypti fly only 400 yards or so. This scared away regular visitors and tourists; business plummeted for restaurants, stores, galleries and bars. Most, however, have recovered and tourists swarmed the area for Art Basel\u2019s fairs last weekend.\u201cWhen you create a map and boundaries, you say inside is a danger zone and outside is completely safe,\u201d said Joe Furst, chairman of the Wynwood Business Improvement District. \u201cYou suffocate a neighborhood doing that.\u201dOn Miami Beach, visits tumbled mostly in September, October and early November but other factors were also in play: Hurricane Matthew had a big impact; the number of hotel rooms has grown significantly in two years; Brazil\u2019s economy is foundering; and the dollar is strong, discouraging international travel, said Rolando Aedo, a top executive at the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. Travel for large meetings was hit hardest by Zika.\u201cIt was something that everyone felt,\u201d said the mayor of Miami Beach, Philip Levine, about the impact on hotels. \u201cBut it boomed back strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House G.O.P. Signals Break With Trump Over Tariff Threat", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders signaled on Monday that they would not support President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s threat to impose a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas, the first significant confrontation over the conservative economic orthodoxy that Mr. Trump relishes trampling.Speaker Paul D. Ryan also pushed back against Mr. Trump on Monday in an interview with a Wisconsin reporter, saying an overhaul of the corporate tax code would more effectively keep companies in the United States than tax penalties. \u201cI think we can get at the goal here,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is to keep American businesses American, build things in America and sell them overseas \u2014 that can be properly addressed with comprehensive tax reform.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s economic positions clashed with traditional conservatives during the campaign, but now these differences \u2014 on trade, government spending on infrastructure, and tax policies \u2014 have set the incoming president on a perilous course with the lawmakers whose support he needs to keep his agenda on track.\u201cThere will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a series of Twitter messages over the weekend.The response from Republican leaders underscored the limits of legislating 140 characters at a time on Twitter, and gave Democrats cause to believe they can work with Mr. Trump to outmaneuver congressional Republicans next year.\u201cThe president-elect won in part by campaigning against the Republican establishment on many economic issues,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. \u201cIf he wants to get something done for working families in this country, he\u2019ll have to stand up to them when it comes time to govern, too.\u201dSome of the parts of the government that Mr. Trump promised to dismantle if he was elected.Mr. Trump first startled Republicans during the campaign when he attacked trade deals, putting himself more in line with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont than Mr. Ryan.His positions helped imperil President Obama\u2019s trade pact with Asian nations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and abruptly stop further trade negotiations, which many experts in both parties believe limits the United States in its economic position against China, especially when paired with tariff threats.\u201cI respect President-elect Trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw from T.P.P.,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said shortly after the election. \u201cWe can\u2019t abandon these markets to China and other competitors, because American businesses and customers will lose out,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump made Republicans bend to his will \u2014 and against their long-held opposition to picking \u201cwinners and losers\u201d in the economy \u2014 even before his inauguration when he announced last month that the Indiana-based air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier would keep roughly 1,000 jobs in the state rather than moving them to Mexico, thanks to $7 million in tax incentives negotiated by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the current governor of Indiana.This is the sort of package Republicans have traditionally loathed. The once intensely conservative Mr. Pence channeled the views of Mr. Sanders when he explained the Carrier deal by saying, \u201cThe free market has been sorting it out, and America\u2019s been losing.\u201dMr. Ryan and many other fiscal conservatives appeared to agree. \u201cEveryone here knows what it means to lose jobs in their districts,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cIf Trump can keep a thousand families from going through such an ordeal, then good for him. And if it makes other companies think twice about the human consequences of their business decisions, so much the better.\u201dBut big tariffs appear too much to abide. Both Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, supported a bill that gave Mr. Obama and his successor special \u201cfast track\u201d authority to negotiate trade agreements, and are proponents of reducing tariff barriers.\u201cTax cuts and deregulation will make the American economy great again, but tariffs and trade wars will make it tank again,\u201d David McIntosh, president of the conservative group Club for Growth, said in a statement, adding, \u201cThe majority leader is right to caution against protectionism and to urge a robust debate on free markets and trade.\u201dHouse leaders want to tackle the problem of companies\u2019 moving operations overseas with a broad rewriting of the corporate tax code, which they say will make American manufacturing more competitive without resorting to punitive measures on individual companies.\u201cTough talk plays well with his base and is arguably even long overdue,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant and former official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cBut ultimately, the legislative focus will be on tax reform and deregulation versus tariffs and trade wars. I don\u2019t believe Republicans will let a golden opportunity to finally pass comprehensive tax reform fall victim to intraparty squabbling.\u201dRepublicans also fought mightily this week to remove a provision from a water bill favored by Democrats \u2014 and aligned with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises \u2014 that would require the use of American-made iron and steel for domestic water infrastructure projects. They said they feared the measure would direct federal funding to some domestic companies but not others.Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are in patch-up mode at present, but how much that holds up remains to be seen.Mr. Trump has been inconsistent on the Medicare issue, and his choice for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, shares Mr. Ryan\u2019s views.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the West Can Learn From Japan About the Cultural Value of Work", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyA few weeks ago, in a Kyoto tempura bar, I watched a lone chef, a man in late middle age, cooking behind a counter for his 11 customers. The set menu had 15 items on it. That meant that at any given moment, he was keeping track of 165 pieces of food, each subject to slightly different timing and technique. He wrote nothing down and expended no apparent effort. It was a demonstration of total mastery. This didn\u2019t look so much like a job as a life: His work was his whole being.\u201cPeople whose jobs involve literally doing nothing,\u201d an American teacher said to me after I got off the bus and described this scene. At the time, though, I was left thinking something different: that what I saw were people who had a strong feeling that their work was meaningful. For these workers, the value they attached to work wasn\u2019t simply its economic value to them. A train conductor bows on entering and exiting a train compartment; a department-store worker does the same thing coming or going from a shop floor, whether observed or not, whether the store is heavingly busy or almost deserted. It\u2019s clear that there are deep cultural differences at work here, not all of them benign; the reason Japanese has a word for \u201cdeath from overwork\u201d is because it needs one. You could even argue that work has too much meaning, is too freighted with consequences for individual identity, in Japan.Among economists, Japan is a byword, a punch line, a horror story. The boom of the late \u201980s and early \u201990s \u2014 during which it became popular to imagine a Japan-dominated economic future, the subject of Michael Crichton\u2019s thriller \u201cRising Sun,\u201d for instance \u2014 was followed by a spectacular stock-market crash. The Nikkei share index hit a high of 38,957 on Dec. 29, 1989. Over the next two decades, it fell 82 percent. Twenty-seven years later, it is still only at less than half that 1989 value. Property values crashed along with share prices, which turned large parts of the financial system into zombie banks \u2014 meaning banks that hold so many bad assets that they are essentially broke, which means they can\u2019t lend money and therefore cease to fulfill one of a bank\u2019s central roles in the modern economy, which is to help keep the flow of credit moving.The Japanese economy ground to a halt. Inflation slowed, stalled and turned to outright deflation. Add Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population, contracting G.D.P. and apparently unreformable politics, and you have a picture of perfect economic gloom.It doesn\u2019t feel like that when you visit, though. The anger apparent in so much of the developed world simply isn\u2019t visible in Japan. A student of the culture would tell you that public displays of anger are frowned on in Japan; a demographer would point to the difficult prospects faced by young Japanese, paying for an older generation\u2019s lavish health care and benefits that they are unlikely ever to enjoy themselves. The growth numbers would seem to imply a story about stagnation. But unemployment is almost nonexistent \u2014 at 3 percent, it\u2019s among the lowest in the developed world. The aging of the society is visible, but so is the distinctive liveliness of the various youth cultures. I\u2019ve been to plenty of stagnant places, and lived in one or two as well, and contemporary Japan isn\u2019t one of them.The answer to that question for lots of people is yes. This isn\u2019t a general human truth about workers at all times and in all cultures, because there are places where waiting and where service in general are deeply respected jobs. But it\u2019s apparent that the new service work has many people doing things that aren\u2019t congruent with their sense of their identity. A life is the story of a life, and that story, for many, has become one of decline and loss, of reduction in self-esteem. The tension in status between different types of work is one theme of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s \u201cMy Struggle\u201d \u2014 indeed, that is essentially what his struggle is, the gap between the narrator\u2019s sense of what he should be doing, as a writer, and what he actually does all day, as a homemaker: \u201cClean floors, wash clothes, make dinner, wash up, go shopping, play with the children in the play areas, bring them home, undress them, bathe them, look after them until it is bedtime, tuck them in, hang some clothes to dry, fold others, and put them away, tidy up, wipe tables, chairs and cupboards.\u201dIt\u2019s sometimes said that the value of manufacturing work is exaggerated, and that we should just get used to the idea that most jobs are now in service industries \u2014 which is probably true. But unionized manufacturing work gave a sense of community and meaning that more atomized, more modern, more service-based work struggles to do. It doesn\u2019t matter that many of those old jobs were boring, or brutally repetitive, or dangerous, or made workers sick \u2014 or, like coal mining, all of those things simultaneously. In the 1937 speech where Franklin D. Roosevelt called for \u201ca fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work,\u201d he stressed that \u201cthe overwhelming majority of our population earns its daily bread either in agriculture or in industry.\u201d Hard manual work created tangible products, and that tangibility was part of what made the work seem meaningful. Miners and autoworkers, laborers in the clothing and electrical and transportation industries, had a social cohesion based on the fact that they worked and sweated and lived and suffered together, creating a tangible product that seemed to them imbued with national, even world-historical, significance. I won\u2019t pretend that I wish I did that kind of work, but I envy the feeling of cohesion and solidarity shared by people who do.The danger is that a class identity founded on collective labor is replaced by an identity founded on resentment, further destabilizing our politics. As Japan shows us, there are worse things for a society than calmly growing old together.John Lanchester has written eight books, including the novel \u201cCapital\u201d and, most recently, \u201cHow to Speak Money: What the Money People Say \u2014 and What It Really Means.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Propaganda With a Millennial Twist Pops Up in China", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The two-minute cartoon opens with a folksy jingle and a smiling bobblehead of President Xi Jinping, dimpled and cherubic. Then it cuts to a colorful montage praising his government for improving the lives of ordinary Chinese with what might seem like a mundane policy: regulations allowing taxis to be summoned online.With vivid animation and quirky sound effects, the video does not feel like propaganda. But its creators, a team of 15 people hired by the state-run media, spent months obsessing over the details, down to the shape of Mr. Xi\u2019s grin. Their mission: to promote Mr. Xi and the ruling Communist Party in a voice that resonates with China\u2019s digitally savvy millennials.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any dry language or political jargon,\u201d said Ma Changbo, 35, a former journalist who is the chief executive of the multimedia studio behind the clip, which was published online by China Central Television, the state broadcaster. \u201cPeople can relate to it.\u201dDecades after Mao Zedong declared the pen as important to political power as the gun, the party still churns out old-school propaganda \u2014 colorful posters with wooden slogans, mawkish movies with patriotic themes, meticulously censored newspapers written in dry, impenetrable language. The evening news is as rigid as ever, almost always opening with Mr. Xi and often featuring the reading of long party communiqu\u00e9s.But Mr. Xi is demanding that the propaganda apparatus step up its game.The fruits of his campaign are popping up online. In addition to a more aggressive effort to stamp out criticism and amplify support on social media, the party has invested millions in animated videos that cast Mr. Xi as a compassionate champion of Chinese workers. Scholars have delivered TED-style talks that rail against Western imperialism. Hip-hop songs pay homage to party history and warn of America\u2019s efforts to topple the Chinese government.It is unclear how effective such tactics will be in winning over a younger generation that is more skeptical of prepackaged messages and increasingly connected to the outside world. Nor is the party\u2019s ability to modernize and reorient its vast propaganda apparatus \u2014 perhaps the world\u2019s largest \u2014 guaranteed. But there is widespread agreement that the old methods are no longer enough.Mr. Xi is trying to increase confidence in the party as it contends with a slowing economy. The campaign also underscores his determination to shore up China\u2019s image abroad as it moves to capitalize on political discord in the West and win new allies. Top party officials have called on news outlets to embrace digital media to help \u201cspread Chinese voices\u201d around the globe.Ye Zhenzhen, 40, who oversees \u201cnew media\u201d for the newspaper group and prefers not to use the word propaganda to describe his work, said the videos were aimed at helping foreigners get beyond clich\u00e9s about political oppression and corruption in China. But he added that finding new ways to talk about China was also a business necessity.\u201cWe can\u2019t simply rely on traditional forms of content,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to diversify and put ourselves in our customers\u2019 shoes.\u201dThe government\u2019s interest in new forms of propaganda has created a booming market for digital media enthusiasts with a nationalist bent.Mr. Ma, whose multimedia studio, Shizhi Media, produced the taxi cartoon, said about a fifth of its clients were party or state entities. The video about the taxi initiative, for example, was produced for China Central Television in September as part of a contract to promote the work of a party body known as the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms, 1,000 days after it was formed.\u201cGovernment agencies used to be content to just get the message out. Now they care about persuasion,\u201d said Mr. Ma, who teaches at an academy that trains party officials. \u201cNot only do they want people to see their messages, they want to make you believe the messages are true and to inform your judgment. This is a major difference.\u201dThe party\u2019s best propagandists, he said, are students of politics and popular culture. Some have analyzed hit songs to learn how to use musical repetition to convey key ideas. Others have looked for inspiration in the speaking style of leaders like President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Mr. Ma said he had sought to humanize Mr. Xi by depicting him and his wife, Peng Liyuan, as animated characters, a technique aimed at attracting people who are not interested in politics. He has also tried to make political topics more appealing by using vivid imagery, producing animations that depict officials scheming at bathhouses to promote Mr. Xi\u2019s anticorruption campaign, for example.The results have not been conclusive. While some of these propaganda videos have gone viral, others have been passed around only to be ridiculed. Few are able to summon the audiences drawn to China\u2019s most popular movies, television shows and songs.The subjects range from the colonialist history of foreign powers to China\u2019s stability compared with the United States and Europe, and each video is aimed to appeal to younger audiences, using a conversational tone, sleek graphics and a minimalist set featuring a leather sofa.Mr. Rao is also working with the Communist Youth League and a rap group known as CD REV to produce music videos that denounce negative foreign media coverage of China and present the country as peace-loving and prosperous.\u201cAll we hear is, \u2018China is poor, it\u2019s a dragon, it will eat us, it will beat us,\u2019\u201d Li Yijie, 22, a singer and lyricist for the group, said during a recording session in Chengdu. \u201cWe want to show people that China is not evil.\u201dThree of the four members of CD REV, who wear ripped jeans and gold watches, were raised by parents who served in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. But Mr. Li said the group found inspiration in the anti-establishment music of hip-hop masters like Eminem and Dr. Dre.Mr. Li said the group saw itself as filling a void where traditional propaganda had fallen short.\u201cChinese patriotic education has failed \u2014 it\u2019s stiff and awkward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to accept the responsibility to make it better.\u201dEmily Feng, Owen Guo and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}

Developing nations bought $65 billion in weapons in 2015, substantially lower than the previous year\u2019s total of $79 billion.The United States and France increased their overseas weapons sales in 2015, as purchases of American weapons grew by around $4 billion and France\u2019s deals increased by well over $9 billion.Constraints on the expansion of foreign weapons sales are \u201cdue, in part, to the weakened state of the global economy,\u201d wrote Catherine A. Theohary, a national security policy specialist at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.\u201cConcerns over their domestic budget problems have led many purchasing nations to defer or limit the purchase of new major weapon systems,\u201d she added. \u201cSome nations have chosen to limit their purchasing to upgrades of existing systems and to training and support services.\u201dRussia, another dominant power in the global arms market, saw a modest decline in orders for its weapons, dropping to $11.1 billion in sales from the $11.2 billion total in 2014. Latin American nations, in particular Venezuela, have become a focus of marketing for Russian arms, the study found.China reached $6 billion in weapons sales, up from its 2014 total of over $3 billion.Among arms manufacturers that also are NATO allies, Germany has found success in marketing naval systems to the developing world, while Britain has done the same with warplanes, according to the report.The most significant overseas weapons sales for the United States last year included new agreements with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar and South Korea.Over all, the largest buyers of weapons in the developing world in 2015 were Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Pakistan, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. After the United States, France, Russia and China, the study found that the major global arms suppliers were Sweden, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Britain and Israel.Advertisement"}

The news sent its shares up about 14 percent in midmorning trading in Australia on Monday.Duet said it was evaluating the offer. Mr. Li\u2019s company, Cheung Kong Infrastructure, based in Hong Kong, did not answer phone calls.The offer represents the second time this year that Mr. Li has tried to acquire Australian infrastructure assets. Earlier, he had bid for Ausgrid, a major electricity distributor. State Grid Corporation of China, a Chinese state owned power company, also bid for Ausgrid.Chinese money has fueled surging home prices and deals for assets such as food companies and ranch land. But that has provoked a backlash in some Australian quarters and calls from lawmakers to limit deals.Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 31 about bids for land in Australia characterized incorrectly efforts by a Chinese and a Hong Kong company to purchase Ausgrid, an Australian electricity company. The companies bid separately to buy Ausgrid, not jointly. (The error was repeated in an article on Tuesday.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Kicks Off \u2018Thank You\u2019 Tour, Reveling in Crowd and Campaign Themes", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byCINCINNATI \u2014 He boasted about himself in the third person. He sneered at the opponents he had vanquished. He disparaged journalists and invited angry chants from the crowd, grinning broadly at calls of \u201clock her up\u201d and \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d He ridiculed the government\u2019s leaders as stupid and dishonest failures.In his first major address since winning the presidency three weeks ago, Donald J. Trump soaked up the adulation of thousands of his supporters at a campaign-style rally here, unabashedly gloating about the \u201cgreat\u201d victory he had secured. If there were any question about whether his evolution to president-in-waiting would temper his presentation or moderate his tone, the rally offered a forceful answer: Not a chance.Kicking off what was billed as a \u201cthank you\u201d tour, Mr. Trump was incendiary and prideful, hopeful and indicting, vengeful and determined. His staff said the rally was the first of several he will hold before his inauguration next month. His tour is an unusual move for a president-elect, most of whom do not return so quickly to the campaign trail, especially while key cabinet positions remain unfilled.Mr. Trump, who has been mostly cloistered in Trump Tower as he tries to assemble a government, was said to be eager to reconnect with voters. Connect he did, whipping the partially filled arena into a frenzy by reprising the red-meat rhetoric from his us-against-them campaign. He repeated pledges to suspend immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, repeal the Affordable Care Act, lower taxes, end unfair trade and \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of corruption.But while he at times stuck to the script on his teleprompter, Mr. Trump came alive when he veered from it to talk about himself and demean those who had opposed him.\u201cWe had a lot of fun fighting Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said, smiling knowingly as the crowd chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d but offering no indication that he intended to do so. In the middle of a scripted part of the speech about lower taxes for businesses, he shifted abruptly to note the magnitude of his wins.\u201cHow about North Carolina \u2014 how well did we do in North Carolina? Remember when they said he cannot win North Carolina?\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding a moment later: \u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t break the blue wall, right? We didn\u2019t break it, we shattered that sucker. We shattered it, man. That poor wall is busted up.\u201dAnd he reserved special bile for the \u201cextremely dishonest press,\u201d provoking boos as he lashed out \u2014 without naming her \u2014 at a network anchor who he said had cried on television on election night when she realized he was going to win the presidency.\u201cYou know what she doesn\u2019t understand, things are going to be much better now,\u201d he said.\u201cI love this stuff,\u201d he said after a nearly 10-minute discussion of his electoral prowess and his critique of the news media. \u201cShould I go on with this for just a little bit longer? I love it.\u201dHe did go on, shifting back and forth between his prepared remarks and his extemporaneous walk down the memory lane of victory.During the prepared parts of the speech, Mr. Trump seemed eager to reach out to the people who had opposed his candidacy. He said the new government would \u201cseek a truly inclusive society,\u201d and he proclaimed that \u201cwe condemn bigotry and hatred in all of its forms.\u201dOn the economy, he vowed to \u201creverse the stagnation and usher in a period of prosperity and growth,\u201d even as he promised to overcome the partisan gridlock that has led to stalemate in Congress during much of the past eight years.\u201cWe\u2019ll compete in the world, we want to compete in the world, but we\u2019re going to compete in the world where it\u2019s a two-way road, not a one-way road,\u201d Mr. Trump vowed. \u201cThe advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven\u2019t for many, many years.\u201dSpeaking in Ohio just days after a Somali refugee wounded several people with a knife at Ohio State University, Mr. Trump essentially attributed the attack to programs to admit refugees \u201cstupidly created by our very stupid politicians.\u201d\u201cWe will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed,\u201d he said, echoing some of his most effective campaign rhetoric.But he sometimes veered from his prepared remarks in the middle of a sentence. A discussion of what his administration would do if a company wanted to move jobs overseas reminded him again of his victories. And that discussion of winning several states led directly into a diatribe against reporters, who he said had never seen his victories coming. Then, when he mentioned Utah, he railed against a third-party candidate who before Election Day had seemed poised to do well.\u201cRemember when they said Donald Trump is going to lose to some guy I\u2019ve never even heard of?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThe people of Utah were amazing, and we trounced them. Hillary came in second, and that guy came in third. What the hell was he trying to prove?\u201dMr. Trump offered both an olive branch and a warning to Democrats in Washington, saying he believed that \u201cthey want to get together\u201d but reminded them that they had lost \u201cbecause the people are angry.\u201d He delivered his promise through the prism of a Republican-controlled federal government.\u201cOur victory was so great, we have the House, we have the Senate,\u201d Mr. Trump said, his last words drowned out with cheers. He smiled and paused, before offering some tepid reassurance that \u201cwe want to get them on board.\u201dMr. Trump opened his rally with a familiar trope: gawking at the crowd and lamenting the difficulty that supporters were having traveling to the arena.\u201cSo I didn\u2019t know what came with this position, and I didn\u2019t know that they closed down the roads around the stadium for an hour and a half,\u201d he said, thanking the crowd \u201cfor being so patient.\u201dBefore he spoke, a familiar scene developed at the arena, with hundreds of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters lined up, some clad in red shirts handing out \u201cTrump/Pence\u201d signs. The prerally soundtrack, heavy on Elton John and the Rolling Stones, rotated through the songs heard during the campaign.The main difference this time: the lectern at center stage, which now had a big, bold \u201cUSA\u201d where the name \u201cTRUMP\u201d used to be.As president-elect, Mr. Trump has at times seemed frustrated by criticism of his business conflicts and his loss by more than two million ballots in the popular vote. But at the rally, Mr. Trump was once again in good spirits, feeding off the fervor in the crowd. He had just come from Indianapolis, where he celebrated his involvement in Carrier\u2019s decision to keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Indiana.Mr. Trump seemed to relish toying with the news media, at one point announcing that he had chosen James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, to be his secretary of defense \u2014 even though his spokesman had said four hours earlier that no decision had been made.\u201cI gave up a little secret,\u201d Mr. Trump said, urging the crowd not to \u201clet it out of this room.\u201dBut nothing seemed to fire up the president-elect as much as recalling his victories in the campaign, each made so much sweeter, he repeatedly said, because the media and his opponents had never seen them coming.\u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe bottom line is, we won.\u201dAn article on Friday about President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign-style rally in Cincinnati misstated the size of the audience that greeted him. It numbered in the thousands, not the tens of thousands.Nick Corasaniti reported from Cincinnati, and Michael D. Shear from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Obama Coalition Crumbled, Leaving an Opening for Trump", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceIt is entirely possible, as many have argued, that Hillary Clinton would be the president-elect of the United States if the F.B.I. director, James Comey, had not sent a letter to Congress about her emails in the last weeks of the campaign.It was clear from the start that Mrs. Clinton was struggling to reassemble the Obama coalition.At every point of the race, Mr. Trump was doing better among white voters without a college degree than Mitt Romney did in 2012 \u2014 by a wide margin. Mrs. Clinton was also not matching Mr. Obama\u2019s support among black voters.This was the core of the Obama coalition: an alliance between black voters and Northern white voters, from Mr. Obama\u2019s first win in the 2008 Iowa caucuses to his final sprint across the so-called Midwestern Firewall states where he staked his 2012 re-election bid.In 2016, the Obama coalition crumbled and so did the Midwestern Firewall.The countryside of Iowa or the industrial belt along Lake Erie is not the sort of place that people envision when they think of the Obama coalition. Yet it was an important component of his victory.Campaign lore has it that President Obama won thanks to a young, diverse, well-educated and metropolitan \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d \u2014 an emerging Democratic majority anchored in the new economy. Hispanic voters, in particular, were credited with Mr. Obama\u2019s victory.But Mr. Obama would have won re-election even if he hadn\u2019t won the Hispanic vote at all. He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004.He excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington to the Red River Valley in Minnesota, along the Great Lakes to the coast of Maine. In these places, Mr. Obama often ran as strong or stronger than any Democrat in history.In 2016, Mr. Trump made huge gains among white working-class voters. It wasn\u2019t just in the places where Democratic strength had been eroding for a long time, like western Pennsylvania. It was often in the places where Democrats had seemed resilient or even strong, like Scranton, Pa., and eastern Iowa.It was a decisive break from recent trends. White voters without college degrees, for the first time, deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the Republicans. No bastion of white, working-class Democratic strength was immune to the trend.For the first time in the history of the two parties, the Republican candidate did better among low-income whites than among affluent whites, according to exit poll data and a compilation of New York Times/CBS News surveys.According to exit polls, Mr. Trump did better than Mr. Romney by 24 points among white voters without a degree making less than $30,000 a year. He won these voters by a margin of 62 to 30 percent, compared with Mr. Romney\u2019s narrow win of 52 percent to 45 percent.In general, exit poll data should be interpreted with caution \u2014 but pre-election polls show a similar swing, and the magnitude of the shifts most likely withstands any failings of the exit polls.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s profound weakness among Northern white working-class voters was not expected as recently as six months ago. She was thought to be fairly strong among the older white working-class voters who were skeptical of Mr. Obama from the start. Most of Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among white voters without a degree was due to his gains among those under age 45.But Mr. Trump expanded on Republican gains among older working-class white voters, according to Upshot estimates, while erasing most of Mr. Obama\u2019s gains among younger Northern white voters without a degree.His gains among younger working-class whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest. Young white working-class voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country. Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among them \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weakness \u2014 was evident from the beginning of the 2008 primaries.Mr. Trump\u2019s gains among white working-class voters weren\u2019t simply caused by Democrats staying home on Election Day.The Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start, according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats. Its models, based on survey data, indicated that they were underperforming Mr. Obama in less-educated white areas by a wide margin \u2014 perhaps 10 points or more \u2014 as early as the summer.The campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012, and found a large number of white working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump.The same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters. Those polls aren\u2019t affected by changes in turnout.The best data on the effect of turnout will ultimately come from voter file data, which will include an individual-level account of who voted and who didn\u2019t. Most of this data is only beginning to become available.But the limited data that\u2019s already available is consistent with the story evident in the pre-election polling: Turnout wasn\u2019t the major factor driving shifts among white voters.The voter-file data in North Carolina, where nearly all of the state\u2019s jurisdictions have reported their vote, shows that the turnout among white Democrats and Republicans increased by almost the exact amount \u2014 about 2.5 percent. The same appears to be true in Florida.Nationally, there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout. Mr. Trump made gains in white working-class areas, whether turnout surged or dropped.The exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters. Perhaps most strikingly, Mr. Trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, including 8 percent of those who \u201cstrongly\u201d approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance and 10 percent of white working-class voters who wanted to continue Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump won 20 percent of self-identified liberal white working-class voters, according to the exit polls, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than Mr. Obama\u2019s.It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white, working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier.The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum. Mr. Trump, if anything, was Mr. Obama\u2019s opposite.But the two had the same winning pitch to white working-class voters.Mr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs. The implication was that he would leave middle-class jobs prey to globalization and corporations.There was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it: coal country. There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed climate-change policies that would reduce the production and use of coal.In retrospect, the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of working-class interests.Mr. Trump owned Mr. Obama\u2019s winning message to autoworkers and Mr. Romney\u2019s message to coal country. He didn\u2019t merely run to protect the remnants of the industrial economy; he promised to restore it and \u201cmake America great again.\u201dJust as Mr. Obama\u2019s team caricatured Mr. Romney, Mr. Trump caricatured Mrs. Clinton as a tool of Wall Street, bought by special interests. She, too, would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business, he said.Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment \u2014 and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn\u2019t out to help ordinary Americans.Taken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration, trade, China, crime, guns and Islam all had considerable appeal to white working-class Democratic voters, according to Pew Research data. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion, same-sex marriage and the social safety net.None of this is to say that changes in turnout didn\u2019t help Mr. Trump at all. It\u2019s just not the reason he made such large gains among white working-class voters.There was no relationship between the change in Democratic support and the change in turnout, or the change in turnout and Democratic strength.But the Democrats did have a turnout problem in November. It wasn\u2019t a broad Democratic turnout problem. It was a black turnout problem.The turnout probably increased among all major groups of voters \u2014 Hispanics, white Democrats, white Republicans \u2014 except black voters.The conclusive data is available in the Southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms, and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout.In Georgia, the black share of the electorate fell to 27.6 percent from 29.9 percent, and in Louisiana it fell to 28.5 percent from 30.1 percent, according to the completed state turnout data.The data is not yet final in North Carolina, but the black share of the electorate looks unlikely to reach 21 percent of voters \u2014 down from 23 percent in 2012. The data is even less complete in Florida, but there too it appears that black turnout will fall by a similar amount \u2014 perhaps to 12.7 percent of voters from 14 percent.In all of these states, the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004. It just wasn\u2019t as high as it was with Mr. Obama at the top of the ticket.Young black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline. They registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections, causing the black share of registered voters to dip. And those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago.The data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country, but it tells a similar story.Turnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of Philadelphia, while rising everywhere else in the city.The turnout in Detroit fell by 14 percent. Turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population, like Milwaukee and Flint, Mich. It\u2019s hard to know just how much of this is lower black turnout instead of black population decline \u2014 the census can struggle to make population estimates in places with a declining population \u2014 but the turnout certainly dropped faster than the reported population decline.Taken in totality, it appears that black turnout dropped somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent \u2014 with few exceptions. It should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country, regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout, like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo ID.Was the decline in black turnout enough to change the result of the election? It seems so. If black turnout had matched 2012 levels, Mrs. Clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Florida and North Carolina would have been extremely close.But pinning Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss on low black turnout would probably be a mistake. Mr. Obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support. (He would have won Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin each time even if Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee had been severed from their states and cast adrift into the Great Lakes.)Perhaps more important, the Clinton campaign\u2019s models and public polls all assumed lower black turnout \u2014 and still showed Mrs. Clinton on track for victory.The Clinton campaign believed it could compensate for the loss of the Obama coalition by winning the so-called \u201crising American electorate\u201d or \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d of well-educated voters and Hispanic voters \u2014 a caricature of the Obama coalition.These demographic shifts have benefited Democrats over the last decade, but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states.According to the exit polls, Mrs. Clinton fared a tad worse among white voters \u2014 but much worse among Hispanic, Asian-American and black voters than Mr. Obama. And those polls said she didn\u2019t win well-educated white voters, as many pre-election polls indicated.But the preliminary Upshot analysis of voting returns, census and pre-election polling data suggests that Mrs. Clinton was stronger among well-educated white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply.It is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary. They will change over the next few years with more data from the Census Bureau and additional polling. But it nonetheless paints an alternative picture that\u2019s more consistent with the actual results, pre-election polls and the consensus of academics and campaign analysts on the electorate.The Upshot estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton really might have become the first Democrat to win white voters with a college degree (although it is very possible that Mr. Obama did so in 2008 as well).Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and best-educated white voters, much as Mr. Trump\u2019s gains were concentrated among the lowest-income and least-educated white voters.She gained 17 points among white postgraduates, according to Upshot estimates, but just four points among whites with a bachelor\u2019s degree.There was a similar pattern by income. Over all, she picked up 24 points among white voters with a degree making more than $250,000, according to the exit polls, while she made only slight gains among those making less than $100,000 per year.These gains helped her win huge margins in the most well-educated and prosperous liberal bastions of the new economy, like Manhattan, Silicon Valley, Washington, Seattle, Chicago and Boston. There, Mrs. Clinton ran up huge margins in traditionally liberal enclaves and stamped out nearly every last wealthy precinct that supported the Republicans.Scarsdale, N.Y., voted for Mrs. Clinton by 57 points, up from Mr. Obama\u2019s 18-point win. You could drive a full 30 miles through the leafy suburbs northwest of Boston before reaching a town where Mr. Trump hit 20 percent of the vote. She won the affluent east-side suburbs of Seattle, like Mercer Island, Bellevue and Issaquah, by around 50 points \u2014 doubling Mr. Obama\u2019s victory.Every old-money Republican enclave of western Connecticut, like Darien and Greenwich, voted for Mrs. Clinton, in some cases swinging 30 points in her direction. Every precinct of Winnetka and Glencoe, Ill., went to Mrs. Clinton as well.Her gains were nearly as impressive in affluent Republican suburbs, like those edging west of Kansas City, Mo., and Houston; north of Atlanta, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio; or south of Charlotte, N.C., and Los Angeles in Orange County. Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t always win these affluent Republican enclaves, but she made big gains.But the narrowness of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains among well-educated voters helped to concentrate her support in the coasts and the prosperous but safely Republican Sun Belt. It left her short in middle-class, battleground-state suburbs, like those around Philadelphia, Detroit and Tampa, Fla., where far fewer workers have a postgraduate degree, make more than $100,000 per year or work in finance, science or technology.But the exit polls show a marked decrease in Democratic strength, with Mrs. Clinton winning just 66 percent of the Hispanic vote, down from Mr. Obama\u2019s 71 percent in 2012. Mrs. Clinton plainly fared worse than Mr. Obama in many heavily Hispanic areas \u2014 like South Texas or South Colorado.Our estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton did about the same as Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters over all. The estimates hint at a potential explanation for the results in some heavily Hispanic areas: Mrs. Clinton may have faltered among Hispanic voters without a high school degree, while making gains among those with some college education or better.Nationwide, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s success in reviving the elements in the caricature version of the Obama coalition really did let her compensate for losses among black voters and working-class whites. She won the popular vote.But it did not do nearly enough good in the decisive battleground states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Aims to Be More Than a People Mover", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsUber Technologies could encounter a bumpy ride into public markets. The ride-hailing service has spent the last several years racking up impressive growth. It also has raised easily at least $15 billion, in the process inflating its value to about $68 billion on paper. That will make the next round, possibly in a 2017 initial public offering, tougher.Founded eight years ago, Uber is now in 77 countries. Despite some regulatory battles, many of which continue, investors have been mostly on cruise control. Net revenue, or the amount the company keeps after paying drivers, hit $1.7 billion in the third quarter, a 240 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, according to the tech news website the Information. The promise of new growth comes from deliveries and self-driving trucks.The valuation already factors in Uber being more than just a people mover. Annual revenue in the American taxi and limousine business is about $20 billion annually, according to the research company IBISWorld. Using America\u2019s share of the global economy as a rough guide, the world market is perhaps five times as big, or about $100 billion.Third-quarter bookings of about $5.4 billion suggest Uber already has claimed a big share of the market. That could mean growth in this area starts to slow soon. Capturing more customers in existing cities and entering rural areas will be harder. Moreover, competition will increase. Uber bowed out of China after burning through $1 billion of cash a year.What is more, Uber still loses money \u2014 potentially as much as $2.8 billion this year, according to the Information, up to 40 percent higher than in 2015. Expanding in places like India is proving costly. When legal fights subside and marketing costs wane, there should be a path to profit. Taking a bigger share of receipts would risk alienating drivers, however, and raising fares threatens its competitive position.That explains why Uber is wisely looking further down the road. Autonomous vehicles would enable it to lift margins, but these also are probably some years off. At the same time, companies like UPS and YRC Worldwide should prove to be more formidable rivals than taxi drivers. Uber\u2019s balance sheet is fortified for these fights. New investors may be wary of their fare.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rick Perry, Ex-Governor of Texas, Is Trump\u2019s Pick as Energy Secretary", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump plans to name Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, to lead the Energy Department, an agency far more devoted to national security and basic science than to the extraction of fossil fuels that is Mr. Perry\u2019s expertise.In choosing him to be secretary of energy, the president-elect is elevating him to a cabinet post that Mr. Perry once said he wanted to eliminate, a proposal that led to one of the most famous gaffes in recent presidential politics.Texas is rich in energy resources, and Mr. Perry is an enthusiastic supporter of extracting them. But it is not clear how that experience would translate into leading the Energy Department.Despite its name, the department plays the leading role in designing nuclear weapons, thwarting their proliferation, and ensuring the safety and reliability of the nation\u2019s aging nuclear arsenal through a constellation of laboratories considered the crown jewels of government science.\u201cThe Rick Perry choice is so perplexing,\u201d said former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who for years led the committee that oversees the Energy Department\u2019s budget.A Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cI think very few people understand that the Energy Department, to a very substantial degree, is dealing with nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Rick Perry suggested the agency should be abolished. That suggests he thinks it doesn\u2019t have value.\u201dStill, the former energy secretaries Spencer Abraham, a Republican, and Bill Richardson, a Democrat, said they could envision Mr. Perry adapting.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of elements to the department that people don\u2019t necessarily know about until you get there,\u201d said Mr. Abraham, who, as a senator from Michigan, also frequently called for the abolition of the Energy Department. He said his views evolved after he was named its leader in President George W. Bush\u2019s first term. \u201cYou find yourself surprised by what it really entails,\u201d he said.About 60 percent of the Energy Department\u2019s budget is devoted to the National Nuclear Security Administration, which defines its mission as enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science. Under President Obama, the Energy Department helped secure an agreement with Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and took on a larger role in efforts to combat global warming, particularly through scientific research. It also established the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to support breakthrough research on clean energy technology.The last two energy secretaries, Ernest J. Moniz of M.I.T. and Steven Chu of Stanford, brought to the office their doctorates in physics, academic credentials and, in Dr. Chu\u2019s case, a Nobel Prize.Mr. Perry, 66, would bring a different set of credentials. He is the longest-serving governor of Texas \u2014 in office from 2000 to 2015 \u2014 and before that was the Texas agriculture commissioner. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in animal science from Texas A&M University.In his 2010 book, \u201cFed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington,\u201d Mr. Perry called the established science of human-caused climate change a \u201ccontrived, phony mess.\u201d His views align with those of Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese.He was briefly a front-runner for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, but his Energy Department \u201coops moment,\u201d as he called it, is widely seen as having sunk his candidacy. His run for the 2016 nomination ended in late 2015, but not before he called Mr. Trump a \u201cbarking carnival act\u201d and a \u201ccancer on conservatism.\u201dMr. Perry did campaign energetically for Mr. Trump later.Mr. Abraham noted that current events often dictate the energy secretary\u2019s role. When he took the job in 2001, he said, his focus was on rolling blackouts in California and the Enron electric utility scandal. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, his attention shifted to counterterrorism and nuclear weapons and nonproliferation programs.Mr. Chu was brought in by Mr. Obama to focus on climate change programs, but in the summer of 2010, he became consumed with personally helping to engineer a way to stop the oil gushing from a blown BP well in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Moniz\u2019s tenure centered on brokering the Iran deal.\u201cThe thing about the department is its diversity, and no one can have a foot in every single department door,\u201d Mr. Abraham said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen people with a science background, a military background. Rick Perry has background running a big bureaucracy, the state of Texas. I think he\u2019ll do a great job.\u201dAnd Mr. Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico who served as Bill Clinton\u2019s energy secretary, said Mr. Perry\u2019s experience leading a state with a diverse energy economy could serve him well \u2014 with one major caveat.\u201cOver all, Governor Perry is a sound choice, because you need a strong leader with political stature and a megaphone for the job, and Rick has both,\u201d he said, noting that he and Mr. Perry had often worked together as governors of adjoining southwestern states. But \u201cas a big fossil fuel advocate, my concern is that Perry will get sucked in by the Trump climate deniers and try to dismantle the valuable renewable energy and climate change programs that the department manages.\u201dFormer department employees and presidential transition officials said a request for lists of specific people involved in shaping climate policy was irregular and alarming. Employees said Tuesday that the choice of a secretary who has vowed to eliminate the agency compounded those fears.An Energy Department spokesman, Eben Burnham-Snyder, said the agency had refused to give the names. \u201cSome of the questions asked left many in our work force unsettled,\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cWe are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gadget Apocalypse Is Upon Us", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtRemember gadgets?They were little electronic things that did stuff for you. They would play music or record videos or give you directions or let you play games on the go. They were fun. Everyone had them. Everyone wanted them. There were whole magazines and websites and even TV shows devoted to them.For 30 or 40 years, through recessions and war, through stability and revolutions, they were always there, one gadget after another, from transistor radios to TRS-80s to Walkmen and Gameboys, then iPods and Flips, GoPros and Fitbits. We were sure gadgets would always be with us, because they had always been with us, and it was good.What happened to gadgets? It\u2019s a fascinating story about tech progress, international manufacturing and shifting consumer preferences, and it all ends in a sad punch line: Great gadget companies are now having a harder time than ever getting off the ground. The gadget age is over \u2014 and even if that\u2019s a kind of progress, because software now fills many of our needs, the great gadgetapocalypse is bound to make the tech world, and your life, a little less fun.Things were never easy for gadgets. The lives of gadgets have always been nasty, brutish and short. One year a gadget would be the Must Have of the Year, and the next year it would be old news. But that was the cycle, and it was fine, because there would always be another gadget.Then things got even worse. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the Thing That Does Everything emerged from Cupertino, Calif. That was almost 10 years ago now. You know what I\u2019m talking about: the iPhone. We knew the Thing was going to be big, but we didn\u2019t know it would be this big. When the Thing threatened to eat up all the gadgets, nobody thought it would really happen. We still had hope that some gadgets would stick around.Much of this isn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cHardware is hard\u201d is an actual phrase that people in Silicon Valley say to pass for wise. What they mean is, starting a company that makes physical stuff has always been more perilous than starting a company that just makes code.That\u2019s why the hardware market has recently been ruled by big companies, either as stand-alone businesses for the likes of Apple and Samsung, or as a kind of come-on for other services. Amazon makes devices like the Kindle and the Echo as an accelerant to its content businesses and its Prime subscription program. Google and Microsoft appear more serious about hardware, and they both might turn devices into nice side businesses. But neither sees hardware as a primary moneymaker; the devices are mainly ways to get us to use more of their software.For start-ups, even in these days of easy contract manufacturing in China, gadgets involve a lot of costs \u2014 you need money for parts and a factory, and shipping and distribution, and you need virtually everything to go perfectly, because if your first gadget is a bust or has some fatal bug, you won\u2019t have a lot of money to make a second one. And even if your gadget is a success, it won\u2019t last long. The gadget economy is hits driven \u2014 you\u2019re only as good as your next big thing.And once you get a hit, you\u2019ll get hit by cheap knockoffs. Just before I went on a trip to Hawaii last year, I thought it would be fun to get a GoPro camera to record some pool stunts. But when I searched Amazon.com, I noticed a ton of generic \u201caction cameras\u201d that carried many of the same specs as the GoPros, at a steep discount on price. I ended up buying an SJCAM for $75, about half the price of the cheapest GoPro I could find. And you know what? It worked pretty well.This is the mixed blessing of cheaper manufacturing. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s much easier to be a hardware start-up than it ever was before, because the Shenzhen ecosystem gives you all the components you need,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, referring to the manufacturing hub Shenzhen, in southern China. \u201cBut that same ecosystem is available to everybody else, too, so setting yourself apart is really tough.\u201dYou might point out that the SJCAM I purchased lacked some of the finer qualities of a GoPro. Its software wasn\u2019t great, and it didn\u2019t offer customer support. If I were an extreme sports enthusiast, I might have cared about those deficiencies. For years, after all, GoPro managed to do very well among its niche audience of people who ride bikes in the snow while drinking Mountain Dew, or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re Xtreme. Other manufacturers tapped other niches \u2014 there are gadgets for running, hiking, walking and several other sports.But Mr. Dawson noted that eventually these companies reach the limit of their natural niche. Every sports enthusiast already has a GoPro \u2014 and that\u2019s when trouble begins. Because I\u2019m more of an extreme Twitter enthusiast than extreme sports guy, and because for me every gadget is essentially just an accessory to my smartphone, the cheaper knockoffs are usually fine for my purposes. This is likely to be the case for you, too.There is something sad about this. The gadget marketplace is the great laboratory of new tech. Gadget start-ups feed the entire tech ecosystem with new ideas. It\u2019s thanks to Pebble that we first saw the latent demand for smartwatches, and thanks to GoPro we realized that people really wanted to take videos of themselves doing underwater handstands. Would we ever have had the iPod if a bunch of start-ups in the late 1990s hadn\u2019t braved legal trouble to create portable MP3 players?But new stuff? Stuff we haven\u2019t seen before? Gadgets? They\u2019re gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Surge Presents Risks for the Trump Administration", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe \u201cbig, fat, ugly bubble\u201d in the stock market that President-elect Donald J. Trump so astutely identified during his campaign now becomes one of the greatest potential liabilities of his presidency.If that bubble bursts soon, the pain will correctly be understood to be the result of monetary manipulations during the Obama years. But if it persists and the United States economy manages to further postpone its long-overdue recession (following an expansion that was barely that), Mr. Trump\u2019s ostensibly \u201cfree-market\u201d policies will unfairly bear the blame when the markets finally do return to reality \u2014 perhaps a year or two down the road.The postelection Trump rally in the stock market is evidence of euphoric optimism about the fiscal stimulus, reduced regulations and lower taxes that are hoped for. And yet we mustn\u2019t forget where we are today, with distorted pricing in virtually all markets and extremely levered public and private balance sheets, all driven by monetary interventionism on a scale never seen before: By most measures, the stock market is as expensive as it has been for a century, save only the giddy late 1990s.The challenge, therefore, is for the incoming administration to let the authorities own the initial pain that is sure to come, such as the pain of pulling off the bandages, while letting the later recovery be his \u2014 as it should be. Though the Obama administration was able to blame a previous administration\u2019s presumed free-market policies for eight years of lackluster recovery, it will be much harder for Mr. Trump to transfer blame for any economic crisis that occurs on his watch.There\u2019s something about a government that steps back to let free markets fix themselves that invariably renders it a ripe target for blame. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have done something?\u201dAfter all, if the rally following his surprise election bears Mr. Trump\u2019s name, the danger is that so, too, will the inevitable correction that neither he nor the Fed can stop. What could result \u2014 and what we should all fear, specifically \u2014 is the political pendulum swinging violently back toward big government and even greater market interventionism.If Mr. Trump can focus on the long term and encourage asset prices and investments to correct themselves early (to the extent that he even holds such sway over them), perhaps this controlled experiment can remain obvious to everyone. Worthy or not, as the current general for advocates of the free market, he should hope to lose the short-term battle to win the bigger war, to gain positional advantage for the looming contest ahead.Mark Spitznagel is the founder and chief investment officer of Universa Investments, and is a former senior economic adviser to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

{"Headline": "I.M.F. Stands by Christine Lagarde, Convicted of Negligence", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byThe International Monetary Fund threw its support behind its leader, Christine Lagarde, on Monday despite her conviction in a French court on charges of misusing public funds.In a statement, the directors of the I.M.F. said they had considered the court\u2019s decisions and had \u201cfull confidence in the managing director\u2019s ability to continue to effectively carry out her duties.\u201dYet the verdict \u2014 with its potential to tarnish Ms. Lagarde as a leader \u2014 came at a critical juncture for the I.M.F.Founded and largely managed by Europeans and Americans, the fund oversees a global economy in which faster-growing countries like China are seeking a greater role.I.M.F. doctrine, which advocates free trade and austerity for countries in financial difficulties, has been criticized as elitist and not sufficiently in tune with the populist movements sweeping the globe.For now, the fund must confront more immediate challenges. With Britain leaving the European Union, Italy\u2019s future in the eurozone perhaps in doubt and the possibility of global trade wars being set off by President-elect Donald J. Trump, some have said the steady, experienced hand of Ms. Lagarde was needed more than ever.\u201cShe has been a very effective leader,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a specialist in international finance formerly at the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury. \u201cYes, there are big questions about the fund\u2019s future. But for her to have to step down now \u2014 well, that would be complicated.\u201dJacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, expressed the Obama administration\u2019s support for Ms. Lagarde, saying that \u201cshe is a strong leader of the I.M.F., and we have every confidence in her ability to guide the fund at a critical time for the global economy.\u201d\u201cAt bottom, it\u2019s all about French politics,\u201d Mr. Truman said.Members of the I.M.F. board were well aware that Ms. Lagarde was facing trial in her native France over allegations that occurred when she was the finance minister in the administration of Nicolas Sarkozy.The consensus among the directors was that Ms. Lagarde\u2019s transgressions occurred when she was not at the fund \u2014 in contrast to those of her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn \u2014 and since taking charge in 2011, she had proved to be a leader capable of presenting a softer side of the fund while fighting hard to bolster its legitimacy in the aftermath of the financial crisis.More so than her predecessors, Ms. Lagarde has pushed the fund to be more aggressive in taking up the cause of women and focusing attention on growing issues of inequality around the world.Over the last year and a half, she has also led a forceful public critique of Europe\u2019s refusal to offer Greece debt relief in return for the difficult economic changes the country has been making.Nevertheless, while Ms. Lagarde may have retained the backing of her board for the moment, over the longer term, her French legal problems may have hurt her most valuable asset \u2014 her carefully constructed public persona.\u201cShe was a breath of fresh air, someone representing true change from the past,\u201d said Peter Doyle, a former economist at the fund and now an outspoken critic. \u201cNow she is just another tainted European leader.\u201dThose are tough words. But economists note that the fund\u2019s core mission of requiring financially ailing countries to reform their economies and fight corruption demands credibility and reputation of the highest order.And that starts at the top, with its leader \u2014 especially one who is as widely known as Ms. Lagarde.\u201cIt would be complacent if not delusional to say there will be no impact on the institution,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a specialist on international economics at the Bruegel Institute in Brussels. \u201cThe only question is how big is the impact \u2014 and how does it compare with the need for stability.\u201dMs. Lagarde\u2019s legal issues in France have dogged her work at the fund since she was appointed in 2011. She took over as managing director after Mr. Strauss-Kahn resigned following accusations that he sexually assaulted a maid in a New York City hotel.The case against Ms. Lagarde centered on Bernard Tapie, a former entertainer and owner of Adidas who had previously been jailed on corruption charges. Mr. Tapie accused the lender Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, in which the French state had a stake at the time, of cheating him when it oversaw the sale of his share in the sportswear empire in 1993. Years of costly legal battles ensued.In 2007, Ms. Lagarde sent the dispute to a three-person private arbitration authority that awarded Mr. Tapie more than 400 million euros, or $420 million at current exchange rates, in damages and interest, to be paid by the state.The court did not fault Ms. Lagarde for approving the arbitration, but it ruled that she had been negligent for not appealing the decision. The court, noting that a judge had previously invalidated the payout in a 2015 ruling and that she had \u201cnational and international\u201d stature, decided not to punish Ms. Lagarde and spared her a criminal record.Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, said he had a \u201cmixed\u201d reaction to the verdict.\u201cOn the one hand, she is found responsible, but given the circumstances, given the responsibilities that Ms. Lagarde had at the time \u2014 in 2008, we were in a major economic crisis \u2014 the court decided that it would not sentence Ms. Lagarde to anything,\u201d he said.Ms. Lagarde\u2019s lawyers can appeal the verdict before France\u2019s highest criminal court, the Cour de Cassation, on procedural grounds. But Mr. Maisonneuve suggested she might not, because no punishment was meted out.Ms. Lagarde did not attend the latest hearing on Monday, but was in Paris last week for the case.Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fix Immigration. It\u2019s What Voters Want.", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDonald J. Trump smashed many orthodoxies on his way to victory, but immigration was the defining issue separating him from his primary opponents and Hillary Clinton. President-elect Trump now has a clear mandate not only to stop illegal immigration, but also to finally cut the generation-long influx of low-skilled immigrants that undermines American workers.Yet many powerful industries benefit from such immigration. They\u2019re arguing that immigration controls are creating a low-skilled labor shortage.These same industries contend that stricter immigration enforcement will further shrink the pool of workers and raise their wages. They argue that closing our borders to inexpensive foreign labor will force employers to add benefits and improve workplace conditions to attract and keep workers already here.I have an answer to these charges: Exactly.Higher wages, better benefits and more security for American workers are features, not bugs, of sound immigration reform. For too long, our immigration policy has skewed toward the interests of the wealthy and powerful: Employers get cheaper labor, and professionals get cheaper personal services like housekeeping. We now need an immigration policy that focuses less on the most powerful and more on everyone else.It\u2019s been a quarter-century since Congress substantially reformed the immigration system. In that time, the population of people who are in this country illegally has nearly tripled, to more than 11 million. We\u2019ve also accepted one million legal immigrants annually \u2014 and a vast majority are unskilled or low-skilled.After all, the law of supply and demand is not magically suspended in the labor market. As immigrant labor has flooded the country, working-class wages have collapsed. Wages for Americans with only high school diplomas have declined by 2 percent since the late 1970s, and for those who didn\u2019t finish high school, they have declined by nearly 20 percent, according to Economic Policy Institute figures.No doubt automation and globalization have also affected wages, but mass immigration accelerates these trends with surplus labor, which of course decreases wages. Little wonder, then, that these Americans voted for the candidate who promised higher wages and less immigration instead of all the candidates \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 who promised essentially more of the same on immigration.America has always offered a basic deal: If you\u2019re willing to work hard and play by the rules, you can make a better life for yourself and your kids. But without good wages, this deal seems impossible, which is one reason so many Americans think their children will be worse off than they are. These Americans see cheap immigrant labor as a way to enrich the wealthy while creating a near permanent underclass for whom the American dream is always just out of reach.Yet, as if Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign never happened, companies in labor-intensive industries want to sustain or even increase current immigration flows. It\u2019s not hard to understand why. Cheap labor helps the bottom line. It is hard to understand why so many politicians would go along. The short-term interest of businesses isn\u2019t the same as the long-term national interest.Our country, like any country, needs borders and must decide who and how many can cross those borders. We must make this decision with the well-being of all our citizens in mind. Today, that means a large reduction in legal immigration and a reorientation toward ultra-high-skill immigrants.This policy would resemble the immigration systems of Canada and Australia, countries with similar advanced economies. While our system gives priority to reuniting extended families and low-skilled labor, their systems prize nuclear-family reunification and attributes like language skills, education and work experience. A similar system here would allow in immigrants like doctors to work in rural areas while not pushing down working-class wages.In some quarters, proposals like these invoke cries of \u201cnativism\u201d and \u201cxenophobia.\u201d But recent immigrants are the very Americans who have to compete with new immigrants for jobs. Far from being anti-immigrant, this proposal would give recent arrivals a better shot at higher wages, stable work and assimilation.We have an immigration policy today that few Americans support or voted for. It\u2019s allowed legal and illegal immigration at levels divorced from what our economy needs. That has undermined the earning power of those Americans least able to afford it.But in this election, Americans finally demanded an end to this unthinking immigration system. President-elect Trump and Congress should take that mandate and act on it promptly in the new year.Tom Cotton is a Republican senator from Arkansas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Scott Pruitt, Climate Change Denialist, to Lead E.P.A.", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump has selected Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry, to run the Environmental Protection Agency, signaling Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to dismantle President Obama\u2019s efforts to counter climate change \u2014 and much of the E.P.A. itself.Mr. Pruitt has been in lock step with those views.A Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions.With the choice of Mr. Pruitt, that hope will have faded.\u201cIt\u2019s a safe assumption that Pruitt could be the most hostile E.P.A. administrator toward clean air and safe drinking water in history,\u201d he added.\u201cAttorney General Scott Pruitt has long been a defender of states\u2019 rights and a vocal opponent of the current administration\u2019s overreaching E.P.A.,\u201d said Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which works on behalf of the coal industry. \u201cMr. Pruitt will be a significant voice of reason when it comes to energy and environmental regulations.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.At the heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change are a collection of E.P.A. regulations aimed at forcing power plants to significantly reduce their emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution. Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally cancel the rules, which were released under the 1970 Clean Air Act. But a legally experienced E.P.A. chief could substantially weaken, delay or slowly take them apart.Beyond climate change, the E.P.A. itself may be endangered. Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to greatly shrink \u2014 or even dismantle \u2014 it. \u201cWe are going to get rid of it in almost every form,\u201d he once pledged.Mr. Pruitt may be the right man to do that. As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt created a \u201cfederalism unit\u201d in his office, explicitly designed to fight President Obama\u2019s health care law and environmental regulations.\u201cYou could see from him an increasing effort to delegate environmental regulations away from the federal government and towards the states,\u201d said Ronald Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma.The close ties have paid off for Mr. Pruitt politically: Harold G. Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Energy, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s 2013 re-election campaign.Mr. Pruitt, who grew up in Kentucky, moved to Oklahoma to go to law school. An avid baseball fan, for eight years he co-owned and managed the Oklahoma City Redhawks, a minor league team. He won a seat in the Oklahoma Legislature and opened a small legal office, which he called Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights.As he ran for attorney general of Oklahoma in 2010, he made clear that he intended to use his power as the state\u2019s top law enforcement official to attempt to force the E.P.A. to back down, convinced that it was wrongly stepping on state government powers.\u201cThere\u2019s a mentality emanating from Washington today that says, \u2018We know best.\u2019 It\u2019s a one-size-fits-all strategy, a command-and-control kind of approach, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we know how to respond to that,\u201d Mr. Pruitt was quoted as saying during his election campaign in 2010.But that campaign, once Mr. Pruitt was sworn in, quickly became an opportunity to work secretly with some of the largest oil and gas companies, and the state\u2019s coal-burning electric utility, to try to overturn a large part of the Obama administration\u2019s regulations on air emissions, water pollution and endangered animals, documents obtained by The Times show.Behind the scenes, he was taking campaign contributions from many of the industry players on his team, or helping deliver even larger sums of money to the Republican Attorneys General Association, which he became the chairman of.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office also began to send letters to federal regulators \u2014 including the E.P.A. and even President Obama \u2014 that documents obtained through open records requests show were written by energy industry lobbyists from companies including Devon Energy. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s staff put these ghostwritten letters on state government stationery and then sent them to Washington, moves that the companies often then praised in their own news releases, without noting that they had actually drafted the letters in the first place.\u201cIt is the job of the attorney general to defend the interests and well-being of the citizens and state of Oklahoma,\u201d Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office said in a statement in 2014 to The Times. \u201cThis includes protecting Oklahoma\u2019s economy from the perilous effects of federal overreach by agencies like the E.P.A. The energy sector is a major driver of the Oklahoma economy.\u201dMr. Pruitt repeatedly explained that he thought states themselves were in the best position to regulate local industries, be it oil and gas companies, or other players that might affect the local environment, such as Devon Energy, which has been a contributor to his political causes, and which he has helped push back against federal regulations.With so much at stake, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation hearings promise to be heated.\u201cAt a time when climate change is the great environmental threat to the entire planet, it is sad and dangerous that Mr. Trump has nominated Scott Pruitt to lead the E.P.A.,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who sits on the committee that must confirm him. \u201cThe American people must demand leaders who are willing to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.

{"Headline": "From Sand to Shimmer: A Casino Resort Rises in Maryland", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetOXON HILL, Md. \u2014 As MGM opens a new resort this week on a hillside overlooking the Potomac River, it will deliver a victory in a long effort to develop a shoreline carved from a sand and gravel pit.The $1.4 billion resort at National Harbor, a minicity south of Washington, puts casino gambling just seven miles from the nation\u2019s capital and is a prominent addition to Prince George\u2019s County, a long overlooked but upwardly striving county of 900,000 residents, the majority of them black.The resort will open on Thursday, and MGM has booked singers including Cher, Sting and Bruno Mars for concerts for its 3,000-seat theater, which will also feature boxing matches.\u201cClearly the entertainment we\u2019ve announced is what most of the people in Prince George\u2019s County said they wanted to see, A-list entertainers,\u201d said Jim Murren, chief executive of MGM Resorts International. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to see a bar band.\u201dRushern L. Baker III, the Prince George\u2019s county executive, recalled that when he took office in 2010, \u201cclearly, the county was facing a lot of issues both from a perception standpoint but also from a revenue standpoint.\u201dMGM pledged to hire 40 percent of its permanent workers and 20 percent of construction workers from the county, and to contract with minority-owned businesses for at least 30 percent of construction work, with 12 percent from within the county. \u201cSo far, they are meeting the goals,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Whiting-Turner, the general contractor, is based in Baltimore. Tobar Construction is in Beltsville, in Prince George\u2019s, as is Toya Mitchell, whose firm, Lord & Mitchell, a minority female-owned small business, has provided marketing materials.In addition, MGM has spent $4 million to renovate a vacant nearby public school, which it used as a training and hiring center and will be returning to the community.Among the shops is the first stand-alone boutique for shoes and accessories by Sarah Jessica Parker, who promises to be stocking shelves and meeting customers several times before starting work in February on the second season of her HBO show, \u201cDivorce.\u201dHer Italian-made shoes will sell for $250 to $495, and her shop will also carry her line of bags and her fragrance, Lovely. \u201cIts close proximity to D.C. is a great draw,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m nervous, but everybody says I should be excited.\u201dTo enhance the property\u2019s aesthetics, MGM has spent more than $20 million on art, commissioning local artists like Margaret Boozer, whose regional map made of red clay clawed from the foundation adorns the wall above the hotel reception desk. The gateway entrance to the casino is a wrought-iron sculpture by Bob Dylan.Totaling more than three million square feet, the resort is projected to draw 20,000 daily visitors. It has provided 6,800 construction jobs and is hiring 4,000 permanent workers. The county projects the resort will pump $41 million to $47 million annually in taxes into its coffers, and more into the state treasury.\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring lots of money from Virginia and D.C. into Maryland, which we like,\u201d said the governor, Larry Hogan.The casino\u2019s 24-story, 308-room hotel has 74 suites at nightly rates of $400 to $12,000, and single rooms from $300 to $800. Mr. Murren said MGM had chosen not to erect a larger hotel because of others nearby. A mile down the hill on the National Harbor waterfront, the Gaylord resort and convention center has 2,000 rooms.Mr. Murren and Jon Peterson, principal of the Peterson Companies, which developed National Harbor, expect that visitors to the MGM resort will also seek out National Harbor\u2019s amenities, and vice versa, aided by shuttle buses. National Harbor\u2019s 350 acres include the Tanger Outlets, which opened in 2013. Underscoring the growth, a National Harbor Convention and Visitors Association was formed this spring with an initial $1 million budget to market the entire site.Immediately adjoining the Capital Beltway, National Harbor is easily accessible by car, and that also promises to be its biggest challenge as the casino resort opens. The site is on a major commuter route that carries traffic across the Potomac between Maryland and Virginia and by Interstate 295, which feeds into the District of Columbia. The developer expects MGM\u2019s presence to double the vehicular traffic into National Harbor, to about 180,000 cars weekly, from 90,000. To ease congestion, the developers and government agencies have invested $10 million in roadway improvements.The harbor on which the project has risen was originally known as Smoot Bay, for the family sand and gravel mining company that owned it. A rezoning to mixed use in 1983 established the legal foundation for what followed. But a succession of developers could not overcome financial hurdles, and the project, while always grandiose in vision, stalled.First, it was the Bay of the Americas, and then Port America, which would have incorporated a 52-story office tower designed by the architect Philip Johnson, on what was known as the Beltway site, where MGM is now. The developer, Jim Lewis, even built a $5 million marketing center, but the economy soured and the project went bankrupt.The Peterson Companies, a large real estate developer based in Northern Virginia, acquired the site in a foreclosure sale. Even though National Harbor opened for business just as the recession was starting, Peterson managed to more than ride it out. Today, National Harbor has more than 150 shops, 37 restaurants, six hotels, offices, townhomes, condos and apartments, and Peterson says it has 11 million visitors, residents and employees there combined each year.As added attractions, Peterson spent $15 million on a Ferris wheel that soars to 180 feet, installed a carousel and built a 64-slip marina, which it hopes to enlarge to accommodate large yachts. Already, boats ferry passengers to and from National Harbor and Alexandria, Va.Slot machines were legal in southern Maryland from 1949 to 1968. Lingering opposition to reintroducing gambling centered on what critics called \u201cslot barns,\u201d casinos without the more upscale table games.After the statewide referendum in 2012, MGM won the right to build at National Harbor a year later.John Lally, a land-use lawyer involved in the original rezoning, predicted last week: \u201cThe casino will be a big draw for everything else down there. It\u2019s obviously a dream come true for a lot of county politicians. We finally got something that the rest of the region is saying, \u2018How come they get to do it?\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of permanent workers the MGM resort at National Harbor is hiring. It is 4,000, not 4,600.An article on Dec. 7 about an MGM casino development opening at National Harbor near Washington misidentified the type of development that Disney had intended to build there before it changed its mind. It was to have been a hotel, not a theme park.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veterans Help Make San Diego a Hub for Start-Ups", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 For decades, politicians lobbied to bring military bases to their districts for one reason: jobs. A base is akin to a corporate headquarters, bringing with it jobs in related businesses.Here, the high concentration of military bases has turned the region into a growing entrepreneurial hub for veterans.Many of San Diego\u2019s veterans start companies that function as contractors and suppliers to the military because of their contacts and security clearances.\u201cIf you look across all sectors of San Diego\u2019s economy \u2014 life sciences, telecom, biotech, health care, I.T., sports innovation, medical and wearable devices, clean tech \u2014 you will find entrepreneurial hubs,\u201d Mr. Cafferty said. \u201cOver time, growth has transformed our region\u2019s economy into a diverse mix of high-growth industries, some with direct ties to defense technology. This can be largely attributed to the veterans who stay here.\u201dYet veterans still face some daunting challenges in transitioning from the military to private-sector entrepreneurship. To address those issues, several groups have set out to help veterans navigate the complexities of starting a small business.\u201cWhen you\u2019re starting a brand-new business and you don\u2019t have any type of business track record because you\u2019ve been serving in the military, it\u2019s very hard to get a loan or find investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are starting a company that\u2019s directly connected to the experience obtained while you were in the military, then you have a network to tap. But if you want to open a Subway, that\u2019s a totally different story.\u201dVeterans who aspire to be entrepreneurs often lack solid knowledge of the industry in which they want to operate, Mr. Figari said. Some, he added, may struggle to understand that as business owners, they will have several jobs, not one.To address those challenges, nonprofit groups and former service members have created programs to give veterans the training they need. Mr. Figari\u2019s group, for instance, provides general entrepreneurship training to veterans in eight counties in Southern California.Nick Norris, a former member of the Navy SEALs, went through the Rosie Network\u2019s training after leaving the military in 2013.Predator Warpaint adopted technology often used in the surfing industry \u2014 a sport that defines San Diego\u2019s beach culture \u2014 and created a camouflage paint that contains SPF 50 sunscreen. The Rosie Network, Mr. Norris said, helped his company make critical connections for building sales channels to the military and to hunters, who buy it online. A Kickstarter campaign raised $30,000 in seed money.The inspiration for it came from his experience in the Navy. \u201cThe coffee is really bad,\u201d Mr. Wang said. His company, now two years old, sells its wares in both military and expat communities globally.Many of those leaving the service, however, may not know if they are suited to run their own businesses.One of them is Charles Matranga, who finished the program in June. Mr. Matranga was a member of the Navy SEALs for 26 years. During that time, he handled a host of business issues, including managing budgets, people and capital. Now, he said he is \u201ctranslating those skills into corporate America skills.\u201dMany of San Diego\u2019s ex-military personnel have found a home in the tech sector, which also dominates the region with companies like Qualcomm, Sapphire Energy and General Atomics. These kinds of technology ventures need engineers, especially electrical, aerospace and communication engineers, who are plentiful in San Diego.There, he created an entrepreneur-in-residence program in which participants collaborate and support one another. In exchange, they volunteer at least five hours per week at the lab. About 20 percent of Fab Lab members are active-duty military or veterans.\u201cThere is something interesting about the intersection of the maker movement and the veteran population,\u201d said Katie Rast, a founder and the director of Fab Lab. \u201cI think there is a call to action that really speaks to those who have served, knowing you have been the creator of something that has use in the world.\u201dThe company has just raised a second round of funding and is preparing for an initial public offering. \u201cI love working with start-ups,\u201d Mr. McAfee said. \u201cThe intensity, the pace, the flexibility and how competitive it all is.\u201dAn article on Thursday about an increase in start-ups run by veterans in San Diego misstated part of the name of a federal agency. It is the Small Business Administration (not Association).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cuomo\u2019s Signature Economic Growth Project Fell Apart in Utica", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byIn Utica, a former industrial hub in upstate New York where the near collapse of manufacturing has made for a scarcity of jobs and a rarity of good news, the announcement in August 2015 that an Austrian chip maker had decided to put down roots in a fabrication plant built by the state was cause for jubilation.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo celebrated with an appearance in Utica, promising $585 million in state funds to cement the public-private partnership, which was to create 1,000 jobs. Some in the crowd wept with emotion.The Utica project was merely one chunk of the multibillion-dollar investment with which the Cuomo administration has pledged to seed nanotechnology and high-tech industries in upstate cities starved for economic growth.But the corruption scheme outlined by federal prosecutors has strained the entire nanotechnology program, threatening to knock economic progress off course in places like Utica, where growth was never certain in the best of times.The state is now scrambling to salvage the Utica plant with a new corporate partner and state administrator. Related projects in Syracuse and Buffalo are in varying degrees of limbo.And the slow-motion unraveling of the Utica deal has raised anew questions about whether the state is spending its millions wisely by trying to engineer New York\u2019s Rust Belt into a can\u2019t-miss destination for solar panel makers and chip fabricators.To hear state officials tell it, a simple leadership switch will do the trick.\u201cPeople have seen a lot of progress. I think people continue to be optimistic about the future, and I think for good reason,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said in an interview, adding that he has had \u201cactive\u201d conversations with other chip makers about moving into the Utica plant. \u201cThe problem will turn out to be an opportunity. I\u2019m comfortable, all in all, that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. We\u2019re making up for lost time in many cases.\u201dFor the state, it seems, the strategy developed by Mr. Kaloyeros and trumpeted by Mr. Cuomo \u2014 to lavish hundreds of millions of dollars in state subsidies on corporate partners to create high-tech jobs \u2014 is unblemished. Yet the model has come in for repeated criticism from government watchdogs, who say an economic policy that tries to create risky new industries virtually from scratch, and that spends millions in taxpayer dollars to create every new job, is folly.\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly skeptical of the economic logic behind these projects because they\u2019re too expensive,\u201d said John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a good-government group. \u201cThere is no economic logic to this, really. But there\u2019s a huge political logic to it. The governor desperately needs for this to be a success for his political legacy in New York.\u201dLocal officials have praised Mr. Zemsky as an inclusive and open manager. For those who watched the Utica deal crumble, however, his involvement was a belated acknowledgment that the state could have done better from the beginning \u2014 and been better attuned to signs that the program was ailing months before the indictments made it obvious.\u201cShifting blame to the procurement process at SUNY Poly is drawing attention away from all the missed opportunities the governor\u2019s office had to step in and make sure the AMS project was moving forward,\u201d said Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat from Utica. \u201cI think the governor\u2019s office, essentially, when it came to economic development upstate, turned the keys over to Alain Kaloyeros, and unfortunately in the case of Utica, Alain drove the bus right off the cliff.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s aides reject the idea that the state has lost credibility in its efforts to revive the upstate economy, saying their economic development efforts were always much bigger than the ones Mr. Kaloyeros oversaw.\u201cSUNY Poly\u2019s narrowly focused on some very high-profile tech projects, but for someone to say economic development, broadly speaking, has been turned over to to someone at SUNY Poly is just incorrect,\u201d Mr. Zemsky said, citing the governor\u2019s efforts to involve regional officials in economic planning and to spread state funds across thousands of smaller economic development projects.He said he was confident that they would ultimately bring the nanotechnology projects to fruition.\u201cThat is the only thing, at the end of the day, that can change that taste in people\u2019s mouths,\u201d he said.The chip fabrication project had been mired in stop-and-go traffic for more than a year, local officials said, beginning in November 2015, when the state missed a deadline to begin soliciting bids for a developer to oversee construction of the chip plant. Local officials and the company had expected $585 million in state funding to be included in the governor\u2019s proposed state budget in January; it failed to materialize.Weeks and months went by without updates. The chip maker was on edge, frustrated and incredulous that the process had stalled.Andrew Kennedy, who was then the governor\u2019s deputy director of state operations, told the members of the Utica group that Mr. Howe would act as their liaison to the governor\u2019s office, Mr. Brindisi said. If they needed anything, they were told, they should go through Mr. Howe.Weeks later, when news leaked that the federal investigation into the state\u2019s economic development contracts had come to center on Mr. Howe and Mr. Kaloyeros, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s instructions ceased to inspire much confidence.For months, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aides have tried to eke out some distance between his administration and Mr. Howe. \u201cAt no time did he represent or speak for the executive chamber,\u201d said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.The state budget passed at the end of March included the promised $585 million for the Utica project. But throughout the spring and summer, as Utica officials and the company sent increasingly urgent letters to SUNY Poly and the governor\u2019s office, the project was delayed still further.In August, Mr. Brindisi and Senator Joseph Griffo, a Republican whose district includes Utica, traveled to the state fair in Syracuse solely to corner Mr. Cuomo, believing the delays warranted his personal attention. The governor promised to call personally the next week, Mr. Brindisi said, but never did.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s director of state operations, Jim Malatras, said the governor had called him to relay what the legislators had said immediately after leaving the state fair, prompting the governor\u2019s aides to call Mr. Brindisi and Mr. Griffo the same day.Top economic development officials were in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with Utica area officials and AMS after the governor\u2019s office learned of their concerns, even traveling to Utica multiple times, Mr. Malatras said.Mr. Malatras said he had not been aware that the Utica chip plant was stumbling until late summer, despite what local officials said were repeated attempts to bring the problems to the attention of the governor\u2019s office throughout the winter, spring and summer. Not until the federal investigation prompted Mr. Malatras and Mr. Zemsky to delve into Mr. Kaloyeros\u2019s projects did they begin to realize that something was off, he said.Finally, in September, the governor\u2019s office sent word that the Utica project was being transferred from Mr. Kaloyeros\u2019s domain to Empire State Development, the agency led by Mr. Zemsky.A few weeks later, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, released a criminal complaint charging Mr. Kaloyeros; Mr. Howe; Joseph Percoco, another former aide to the governor; and several upstate developers in a yearslong bribery scheme. The complaint described a pattern of misconduct, mismanagement and corruption in the governor\u2019s signature economic development program.It was too late for AMS: The company withdrew around Thanksgiving, telling local officials that the delays had made it impossible for the company to begin producing its chip technology on schedule.\u201cI\u2019m very frustrated,\u201d Mr. Griffo said. \u201cObviously, it was a setback.\u201dHe said he hoped the state would develop a process for regularly reviewing how effective its economic development programs were, but, like Mr. Brindisi and Mr. Zemsky, said he still believed a public-private partnership with a chip maker was the best option for the Utica site.Anthony J. Picente Jr., the Oneida County executive, recalled how the initial announcement of the hub had used the term \u201cgame-changing,\u201d which \u201ccreated an even greater sense of optimism.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through some tough times here in Oneida County over the years,\u201d Mr. Picente said. The collapse of the agreement, he said, \u201cdealt a blow.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf this had been in the hands of the right people from the beginning, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be sitting here right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Rev Up the Economy? Don\u2019t Worry About the Trade Deficit", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe economic policy of President-elect Donald J. Trump is still a work in progress. But if campaign rhetoric is a reliable guide, reorienting trade policy may become one of the main goals of the new administration.That conclusion is correct, but only in a superficial sense. Gross domestic product is, by definition, the sum of consumption spending, investment spending, government purchases and the net exports of goods and services. If net exports rose from their current negative value to zero, and the other three components stayed the same, domestic production would increase and, consequently, so should employment.But a fuller look at the macroeconomic effects of trade deficits suggests that things aren\u2019t so simple.The most important lesson about trade deficits is that they have a flip side. When the United States buys goods and services from other nations, the money Americans send abroad generally comes back in one way or another. One possibility is that foreigners use it to buy things we produce, and we have balanced trade. The other possibility, which is relevant when we have trade deficits, is that foreigners spend on capital assets in the United States, such as stocks, bonds and direct investments in plants, equipment and real estate.The trade deficit is inextricably linked to this capital inflow. When foreigners decide to move their assets into the United States, they have to convert their local currencies into American dollars. As they supply foreign currency and demand dollars in the markets for currency exchange, they cause the dollar to appreciate. A stronger dollar makes American exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which in turn pushes the trade balance toward deficit.From this perspective, many of the policies proposed by Mr. Trump will increase the trade deficit rather than reduce it. He has proposed scaling back both burdensome business regulations and taxes on corporate and other business income. His tax cuts and infrastructure spending will most likely increase the government\u2019s budget deficit, which tends to increase interest rates. These changes should attract even more international capital into the United States, leading to an even stronger dollar and larger trade deficits.But what about those tariffs that Mr. Trump sometimes threatens to impose on foreign countries? They would certainly curtail the amount of international trade, but they are unlikely to have a large impact on the trade deficit.When American consumers facing higher import prices from tariffs stop buying certain products from abroad, they will supply fewer dollars in foreign-exchange markets. The smaller supply of dollars will drive the value of the dollar further upward. This dollar appreciation offsets some of the effects of the tariff on imports, and it makes American exports less competitive in world markets.But it doesn\u2019t matter much, anyway, because in reality, trade deficits are not a threat to robust growth and full employment. The United States had a large trade deficit in 2009, when the unemployment rate reached 10 percent, but it had an even larger trade deficit in 2006, when the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent.Rather than reflecting the failure of American economic policy, the trade deficit may be better viewed as a sign of success. The relative vibrancy and safety of the American economy is why so many investors around the world want to move their assets here. (And similarly, it is why so many workers want to immigrate here.)Mr. Trump says he wants to restore more rapid economic growth. That is a sensible goal. But focusing on the trade deficit is not the best way to achieve it.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Los Angeles Drivers on the 405 Ask: Was $1.6 Billion Worth It?", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It is the very symbol of traffic and congestion. Interstate 405, or the 405, as it is known by the 300,000 drivers who endure it morning and night, is the busiest highway in the nation, a 72-mile swerving stretch of pavement that crosses the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles.So it was that many Angelenos applauded when officials embarked on one of the most ambitious construction projects in modern times here: a $1 billion initiative to widen the highway. And drivers and others put up with no shortage of disruption \u2014 detours and delays, highway shutdowns, neighborhood streets clogged with cars \u2014 in the hopes of relieving one of the most notorious bottlenecks anywhere.Six years after the first bulldozer rolled in, the construction crews are gone. A new car pool lane has opened, along with a network of on- and offramps and three new earthquake-resistant bridges.But the question remains: Was it worth it?\u201cIn the long term, it will make no difference to the traffic pattern,\u201d said Marcia Hobbs, who has lived her whole life in Bel Air. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed substantial cutbacks in traffic. As a matter of fact, I would say it was the opposite.\u201dThe cost of the Sepulveda Pass project was supposed to be $1 billion. It has now reached $1.6 billion, after transit officials approved $300 million in new expenses last week.The aftermath of the 405 project has emerged as a cautionary tale for Los Angeles, as well as for President-elect Donald J. Trump, regarding ambitious public works construction. On Election Day, voters here approved a sales tax surcharge that over the next 40 years will pay for $120 billion in spending on highways, subways and bus lines, also overseen by the county transportation authority. Mr. Trump has said a vast national infrastructure project will be one of his first priorities upon moving into the White House.For many in Los Angeles \u2014 a city which, for all its many pleasures, is in no small part defined by traffic congestion \u2014 one outcome of this closely watched endeavor was disappointment.Zev Yaroslavsky, a former member of both the county Board of Supervisors and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said the work \u201cmade a difference on a number of fronts,\u201d but he called it \u201cthe most disruptive project\u201d he had seen during his 40 years in public life here.\u201cI doubt the project would have been undertaken in the first place if we\u2019d known it would cost $1.6 billion,\u201d said Mr. Yaroslavsky, whose district includes the Sepulveda Pass. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bad taste in my mouth about this. There were mistakes made all around. It was a nightmare of a project.\u201dTransit officials were quick to defend the 405 project, saying it was an essential part of a crucial campaign to expand the transportation network in a city notorious for traffic congestion. It was extraordinarily complicated, they said, because the highway remained open while the work continued, and contractors had to grapple with moving hundreds of miles of utility pipes and lines discovered only after ground was broken.\u201cIt really did improve the traffic conditions on the 405,\u201d Phillip A. Washington, the head of the transportation authority, said. \u201cAdded capacity. Made the freeway safer. Traffic would have been much worse if we had not done anything.\u201dStill, the price was high \u2014 in inconvenience as well as dollars.Bob Anderson, an engineer from Sherman Oaks who was on the community advisory board for the project, said his neighborhood was disrupted for nearly five years. And with the construction over, now all he sees are long lines of cars trying to enter or exit the highway.\u201cAs far as improvement, I don\u2019t see anything,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cWas it worth a billion dollars? I doubt it. Was it worth $1.6 billion?\u201dThe sentiment voiced by Mr. Anderson is not unanimous. Richard Close, 73, who has lived in Sherman Oaks for 43 years, said his daily commute to Santa Monica has become easier, and with the construction crews gone, he has come to appreciate the new 405. He said he leaves his office after 7 at night, to miss the worst of rush hour, and it takes about 75 minutes to go 15 miles, which he said saved him 15 minutes a night on his old commute.\u201cI wanted to shoot myself,\u201d he said of the construction period. But \u201cthese improvements are for the next 50 to 100 years. We had to bite the bullet for five years.\u201dMr. Close said he was unperturbed by the expense. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t get it to widen the 405 freeway, other areas of the state would have gotten the state money and other areas of the country would have gotten the federal funding.\u201d\u201cI certainly do believe that the announcement timing was influenced by the Measure M vote,\u201d Martin Wachs, an urban planning researcher at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, said. \u201cIf I were a public official facing a vote like this, I would have a tug at my heart.\u201dTransit officials said the cost overruns were announced as soon as they were approved by the board. And Mr. Washington argued that voters, struggling with the daily burden of traffic here, would have supported it if they had known of the latest $300 million overrun. \u201cTiming was not a factor,\u201d Mr. Washington said.Whether all this money and work achieved the central goal for most motorists is a more difficult question to answer.The work began amid an economic downturn, when fewer cars were on the road. The economy is now thriving, which can be seen in the skyline of cranes, as well as in the crowded roadways from Venice to downtown Los Angeles. And improving the capacity of a highway tends to encourage more people to use it instead of, say, making their way across the pass on local streets.\u201cIf you go out there at 5 p.m. on a Friday and look at the delay, anyone in my business could have told you that adding the capacity that they added to the corridor would have little or no effect on delays during that period,\u201d Brian D. Taylor, the director of U.C.L.A.\u2019s Institute of Transportation Studies, said.Kajon Cermak, a native of Chicago who has for the past 13 years chronicled traffic for KCRW, a public radio station in Santa Monica, said there has been little difference. Not that she ever expected much. Ms. Cermak, who lives in the San Fernando Valley, decided long ago to spend two or three nights every week on a 38-foot trawler anchored in Marina del Rey, rather than endure the agony of an hour commute back home.\u201cI don\u2019t think the drive is going to be any better now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably longer.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the cost and effectiveness of widening the 405 freeway to ease traffic congestion in Los Angeles misstated part of the name of the institute of which Brian D. Taylor is director. It is the U.C.L.A. Institute of Transportation Studies (not of Traffic Studies).Advertisement"}

But more painful to consider is the human toll. Studies have exposed the devastating effects of parental deportation on the millions of children left behind, the majority of whom are United States citizens.These studies link deportation to increased poverty, with its myriad ailments for those left behind: increased hunger, poor health, decline in emotional well-being, learning difficulties and, yes, homelessness. Where do you think those children go when their fathers, the main breadwinners, are deported? Homeless shelters, of course!As a pediatrician working with these very families, I see these deleterious effects firsthand. It is inconceivable to me that government policy can be responsible for directly harming children. Foreclosure is ugly; throwing women and children onto the street is deplorable.ALAN SHAPIRONew YorkThe writer is medical director and co-founder of Terra Firma: Healthcare and Justice for Immigrant Children. To the Editor:Housing foreclosures can lead to more divorce, unemployment, crime and neighborhood eyesores. Now, new research shows that deportations often lead to more foreclosures.Some are unmoved by moral pro-diversity arguments. Others ignore practical arguments for inclusivity (like increased entrepreneurship). We hope that many will look hard at this new evidence that reducing deportations, not increasing them, makes families, neighborhoods, housing markets and our entire economy stronger.LAURA BARRETTExecutive DirectorInterfaith Worker JusticeChicagoAdvertisement"}

The new airport, Daxing International, will have up to seven runways and 7.5 million square feet of floor space.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether there will be enough passengers,\u201d said Jia Zhiguo, an assistant general manager for the airport construction project. \u201cIt\u2019s whether we will be able to handle all of the passengers.\u201dChina has unleashed a huge spending spree to prop up its slowing economy, raising concerns about its growing debt and its surplus of such things as steel factories and coal plants. But Daxing shows that despite China\u2019s economic ascension, decades of major construction projects and worries about overcapacity, the fast-growing and increasingly affluent country still has basic infrastructure needs it has to meet.\u201cInfrastructure investment in China is often misallocated because of the inadequacies of strategic planning, the availability of essentially free credit, and the lack of consequences for the builders and local governments when investments do not yield sufficient returns,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, the deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cI travel around China frequently, and there\u2019s always a problem,\u201d said Paul Adkins, managing director of AZ China Ltd., a consulting firm. Once, his short flight from Shanghai to Beijing became a 24-hour gantlet that included sleeping over at a college dormitory and being locked in a bus without air-conditioning for an hour. Another time, he and fellow passengers were ordered to run through the airport for a plane that had already left.\u201cHow many times have we sat in the plane at the gate waiting for clearance?\u201d Mr. Adkins said in an email. \u201cThe best way to manage hundreds of passengers is to bottle them up inside the airplane.\u201d\u201cIt was by far the wildest thing I ever saw at an airport anywhere,\u201d said Matthew Sheehan, a journalist who shot the video.China\u2019s risk-averse aviation institutions also enforce a much higher standard of operation in the name of safety, which can decrease airport efficiency. In the United States or Europe, flights at major airports land every 30 seconds or so, said David Yu, the Asia executive director at IBA Group, an aircraft consultancy. In China, the gap can be three times that to minimize the chances of an accident.\u201cThe levels of activity we\u2019re seeing in China and the tremendous growth in air traffic has obviously made the air traffic controllers unable to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that they\u2019re cautious. It\u2019s a learning curve from their point of view.\u201dThe airport construction site \u2014 a muddy expanse dotted with lumbering trucks and a dizzying array of cranes \u2014 is a hive of activity. There are workers on site 24 hours a day to complete the airport in time. Much of the initial construction for the transportation hub underneath the airport is hidden from sight, but scaffolding outlines the basic contours of the main terminal.Daxing\u2019s first terminal is scheduled to be open by 2019. The hub underneath will connect the airport by high-speed rail and train to the neighboring cities of Hebei and Tianjin as well as to Beijing. It was designed by the French airport design firm ADPI and Zaha Hadid Architects.\u201cThis is the most compact form you can have for an airport terminal with that capacity,\u201d said Cristiano Ceccato, an associate at Hadid Architects who helped put together the winning bid for the design. \u201cIn the end it was simple geometry. There\u2019s only so many ways you stack people or stack planes around to maximize contact with something at minimum distance.\u201dThat compactness means that walking between the two farthest points in the first terminal should take no longer than eight minutes. The airport\u2019s six piers have been designed to create additional contact areas to house more gates, thus increasing the number of flights the airport can handle each hour.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a new airport typology which is just emerging, but it has been taken much further in this new one,\u201d said Henrik Rothe, a senior lecturer in airport design at Cranfield University in England.When completed, the airport\u2019s first terminal will be able to handle 45 million passengers a year. Two additional phases will bump up the total capacity to 100 million by 2040.Don\u2019t expect everything to be ready in the first phase of construction, though, planners warn. \u201cAn airport at this scale hasn\u2019t been built before,\u201d Mr. Rothe said. \u201cThe expectation to be working from day one is quite high.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ghana Presidential Vote Hinges on Economic Perceptions", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byACCRA, Ghana \u2014 In the four years that Ghana\u2019s president, John Mahama, has been in office, the nation\u2019s economy has plunged along with oil and commodities prices. The West African country is on track this year to grow at its slowest rate in more than two decades.As voters go to the polls on Wednesday, Mr. Mahama is seeking to convince them that he has helped steady and has somewhat improved a situation created by global forces beyond his control.Gold, oil and even cocoa bean prices have all dropped, leaving Ghana with a currency crisis, an electricity shortage and a fed-up population that is having trouble seeing the benefits of any incremental progress Mr. Mahama has achieved.\u201cWe have done much work, but more needs to be done and we can only advance faster if we press on and stay the course,\u201d Mr. Mahama told a rally of his supporters on Monday, according to Reuters.While Mr. Mahama has sought to revamp Ghana\u2019s infrastructure, soaring debt and high inflation have hampered the economy. To cope with the mounting debt, Mr. Mahama\u2019s government took a $918 million bailout last year from the International Monetary Fund, which says uncertainty over oil and gas outputs jeopardize the country\u2019s chances for faster growth in the near future.Mr. Mahama, a former vice president who ascended in 2012 after the death of his predecessor, John Atta Mills, faces a tough race against Nana Akufo-Addo, a perennial presidential candidate who has emerged as the front-runner of several other opposition candidates on Wednesday\u2019s ballot.On the streets of Accra, the two main candidates\u2019 faces are everywhere on billboards and T-shirts, while supporters drape party flags out of car windows.Mr. Akufo-Addo, 72, a lawyer, has hinged his campaign on the economy, pledging to create jobs for young people and stabilize the currency, which has sunk in past months.\u201cThe atmosphere is ripe for change,\u201d said Perry Okudzeto, a spokesman for Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s campaign, citing a weak economy. \u201cThe people of Ghana are tired.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s New Patriotic Party can mobilize urban voters who felt the pinch of electricity cuts and the economic slowdown in recent years, according to Franklin Cudjoe, president of the Imani Center for Policy and Education, a Ghanaian research organization.In the past, Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s strategy has relied on traveling the world trying to gain the support of leaders in the United States and elsewhere. In recent months, his campaign has focused more on rallying grass-roots support.For many Ghanaians, the economic slowdown has been palpable.Alfred Bossman, a 42-year-old electrical engineer, said the cost of doing business was too high and that economic development had been hamstrung by corruption.\u201cA lot of money has gone into the wrong hands,\u201d said Mr. Bossman, who said he planned to vote for Mr. Akufo-Addo because he had faith in the candidate\u2019s ability to turn the economy around.Emelia Larbi, 38, plans to vote for him, too. She lost her vending stand in floods that devastated Accra last year. Mr. Akufo-Addo might give her and other Ghanaians a fresh start, she said.An economy supporting so many infrastructure projects \u201ccannot be said to be an economy that is dying,\u201d said Kofi Adams, Mr. Mahama\u2019s campaign coordinator.\u201cOur president and government have performed,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cThis is a government that has brought a lot of things that did not exist into this country.\u201dThe president has centered his campaigning in areas that have benefited from his infrastructure improvements. In some areas the strategy has paid off.Nana Asare, 37, who sells auto parts, said he would vote for Mr. Mahama because he was optimistic the president\u2019s modernization efforts could deliver more jobs.\u201cI have trust in him,\u201d Mr. Asare said.Despite scattered claims of voter intimidation in an extremely close race, election observers in Ghana said they expected another peaceful vote. For the last two decades the nation has handed off power from leader to leader with calm, even as neighboring countries endured violent presidential transitions.Both chief candidates in Wednesday\u2019s election have signed agreements calling on supporters to uphold the peace, no matter the result.\u201cGhana has set the gold standard for democracy in West Africa,\u201d said Johnnie Carson, a board member of the National Democratic Institute, which is helping monitor the vote. \u201cElections have been close, but they have always been largely peaceful, fair and transparent.\u201dSean Lyngaas reported from Accra, Ghana, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Sean Lyngaas reported from Accra, Ghana, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wary Corporate Chiefs Keep an Ear Tuned to Trump\u2019s Messages", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byIt started with Carrier. Ford was next. So by the time Donald J. Trump singled out Boeing for a Twitter taunt on Tuesday, corporate executives across America had read the writing on the wall: It was time to hunker down.Initially aiming to pressure companies like Ford and Carrier to keep factory jobs at home instead of moving them to Mexico, Mr. Trump has upped the ante in recent weeks, forcefully reminding business leaders of his campaign vows to impose painful tariffs on companies that ignore him.Fresh off a deal intended to keep roughly 1,000 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis, Mr. Trump took aim at Boeing on Tuesday with a complaint that it was overcharging the government on a potential $4 billion contract to replace Air Force One. \u201cCancel order!\u201d he wrote in a Twitter message.Unlike the earlier factory-focused attacks, Boeing\u2019s turn as a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire caught big business off guard, especially since Boeing is among the bluest of the blue chips and is not just a substantial employer in the United States but the single largest American exporter.For all of Mr. Trump\u2019s theatrics, the fear in the executive suites of ending up in the cross-hairs of the president-elect is real, according to Bill George, a former chief executive of Medtronic, a large medical equipment maker based in Minneapolis with over $30 billion in global revenues.And it is not just those who do a lot of business with the government. More broadly, the country\u2019s chief executives find themselves in an unusual and unexpected position with an incoming Republican administration \u2014 on the defensive. And whether they like it or not, current and former business leaders said Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages and other statements will filter through corner offices and boardrooms and influence decision making.\u201cNot that they didn\u2019t think about it before, but C.E.O.s are going to think harder about the consequences for the economy of moving jobs overseas,\u201d said Kevin Sharer, who ran biotech giant Amgen for more than a decade beginning in 2000 and has served on the boards of Chevron, 3M and Northrop Grumman. \u201cWhat the president-elect is trying to do,\u201d he said, is send the message \u201cthat his priority is jobs and the economy.\u201dBut Mr. Sharer said Mr. Trump\u2019s methods so far are limited and relatively easy for big business to accommodate. \u201cThis is a very, very minor move,\u201d he said, referring to how United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent, agreed last week to keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico following pressure from Mr. Trump. \u201cIf a new president says please don\u2019t, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dBlair Effron, co-founder of Centerview Partners, a leading independent investment bank in New York, echoed Mr. Sharer\u2019s analysis.\u201cAll in all, this is probably more important in terms of symbolic impact than it is in terms of substance,\u201d said Mr. Effron, a prominent Wall Street Democrat who strongly supported Hillary Clinton for president. \u201cBut symbols matter.\u201dMr. Trump said he intended to continue his crusade. In an interview with Time magazine, Mr. Trump said he would ask his newly appointed chief of staff, Reince Priebus, for a list of companies that have announced plans to leave the United States.\u201cI can call them myself,\u201d he told Time. \u201cFive minutes apiece. They won\u2019t be leaving. O.K.?\u201dStill, for all the sturm und drang, the underlying message from the president-elect\u2019s cabinet appointments is that he is building an administration of business-friendly veterans of government and Wall Street who favor a wish list of corporate goodies like tax overhaul and deregulation.Mr. Trump, and the vice-president elect, Mike Pence, have made clear that in addition to sticks like public shaming and the threat of tariffs, they would push for these carrots for big business as well. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the companies,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview last week on the floor of Carrier\u2019s Indianapolis plant. Washington, he said, \u201chas been taxing and regulating companies to death. We\u2019re untaxing and unregulating.\u201dHopes are already running high among leaders of the biggest public companies that the Trump administration will relax what they see as burdensome regulations, along with overhauling the corporate tax code. Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts, after all, may be a small price to pay for looser regulations or being able to pay only a modest tax when repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars now parked overseas.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to be shamed,\u201d said Mark Sutton, chief executive of International Paper, in an interview with CNBC. \u201cIf it created a dialogue, if taxes were your problem and that\u2019s why you made some decisions and that created dialogue, then I think maybe it could be for the good.\u201dAt the same time, though, Mr. Trump has been highly unpredictable, more reminiscent of a European or Latin-American-style populist, said Mr. George, who currently is a professor at Harvard Business School.At almost the same moment, he publicly thanked SoftBank, a Japanese company, for investing and creating jobs in the United States. Earlier, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s chief executive, met with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower.Although Mr. Trump claimed credit for SoftBank\u2019s decision to invest up to $50 billion in the United States, those plans predated the election, and Mr. Son has owned a controlling stake in the mobile phone carrier Sprint, among other companies, for several years.Since the election, Sprint shares have risen 40 percent, partly on hopes that it could be acquired by its rival T-Mobile. While antitrust officials under President Obama have been wary of deals in the telecom sector, Mr. Son and investors are hoping the Trump administration might look more favorably on any potential deal.Mr. George, who has served on the boards of several Fortune 500 companies, acknowledged that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats on Twitter will force chief executives to think twice before moving production overseas, at least initially.\u201cIt will act as a short-term deterrent in terms of closing factories and moving overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t change the long-term trend but he clearly promises to be an activist president who will use the bully pulpit throughout his presidency.\u201dTaking on individual companies raises the risk, some say, of potential abuses by those who might have advance knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. Boeing\u2019s shares, for example, initially took a dive after his Twitter message on Tuesday before subsequently recovering.\u201cIf you knew about the tweets beforehand, that would be insider trading,\u201d said Adam Pritchard, a University of Michigan law professor who served at the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1990s. \u201cYou could make small sums of money, I suppose, but if you are buying in large enough volume to move the market or make a lot of money, that would be enough to alert the surveillance units of the exchanges.\u201dWhile some chief executives may be rattled by Mr. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff style, others, especially in the manufacturing sector, say they welcome the idea of a businessman in the White House and his focus on keeping jobs in the United States.\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him but I can\u2019t overstate what a bunker mentality most businesses have after eight years,\u201d said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, an Ohio manufacturer of paints, sealants, and specialty chemicals with over $5 billion in sales. Mr. Sullivan said that he had supported Gov. John Kasich of Ohio in the Republican presidential primaries; even though he did not vote for either main-party candidate in the general election, he said that he now looked forward to working with the new administration. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a fight,\u201d he said.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson Led Exxon\u2019s Shift on Climate Change; Some Say \u2018It Was All P.R.\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byMr. Tillerson\u2019s speech was years in the making \u2014 part of a turnaround after decades of public denial that the planet was warming, even as Exxon\u2019s own research suggested that it was. It had paid outside organizations to spread doubts about the science. But pressure on the company was building, and the newly elected President Obama had pledged to fight climate change and had singled out Exxon as an example of corporate greed.Was this a sincere change of heart, or merely a cynical shift in corporate messaging? Environmental activists are skeptical.The history of Exxon\u2019s shift suggests that however earnest Exxon Mobil might sound in its pronouncements on policy, it has done little or nothing to help put carbon taxes into effect.Both carbon taxes and cap and trade put a price on carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that makes a major contribution to climate change. Both can reduce emissions, and policy experts endlessly debate which would be more effective. But in January 2009, one difference was clear: A cap and trade plan sponsored in the House of Representatives by Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, was gaining bipartisan support. A more straightforward carbon tax was going nowhere.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.The process leading up to Exxon\u2019s new public stance was as deliberate as the turning of a supertanker. \u201cThey don\u2019t just sort of throw these ideas against the wall and see what sticks,\u201d said Bennett Freeman, a consultant and former official at the State Department who took part in meetings with Exxon officials in the years leading up to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s speech.In a recent interview, Alan T. Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, denied that the company\u2019s shifting statements on climate change were a response to tobacco\u2019s liability issues. \u201cIt was not a liability-based decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a science-based decision.\u201dThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or I.P.C.C., had by then said that the science was \u201cunequivocal\u201d in showing that the earth\u2019s temperature was rising and that human activity was almost surely a factor. \u201cAs the science firmed up on that, our understanding and the rest of the world\u2019s did, too,\u201d Mr. Jeffers said. He described the company\u2019s change as an \u201cevolution,\u201d not an abrupt shift.For more than 10 years, the company held a series of retreats with environmental experts like Mr. Freeman and other activists to discuss issues like human rights and climate change, according to the book \u201cPrivate Empire: Exxon Mobil and American Power,\u201d by Steve Coll. Those meetings, which began around 2003, were \u201cpart private retreat, part focus group and part lobbying briefing\u201d for leaders in the areas of human rights, environmental activism and more, Mr. Coll writes.By 2006, the year that Mr. Tillerson became chief executive, attention to climate change was growing. The documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d featuring former Vice President Al Gore, came out that year. In the midterm elections, Democrats made significant gains, retaking control of the House of Representatives.Participants in a conference in late 2006 criticized the company\u2019s funding for climate-change deniers, according to Mr. Coll\u2019s account. Ken Cohen, then the company\u2019s vice president for public and government affairs, told participants that the company was dropping funding for some of the groups as part of a broader review; their fiery approach was becoming, he said, a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the issues. After that meeting, participants received a letter from Exxon saying its position on climate change was \u201cmisunderstood.\u201d The letter did not acknowledge that the company was changing its position, nor that it had done anything wrong in the past.At a retreat in October 2008, Mr. Freeman spoke with executives about human rights and climate change. With the election close at hand, he recommended the company support cap and trade.In an interview, Mr. Freeman said he shared a limousine to La Guardia Airport after the conference with Mr. Cohen. He recalled telling Mr. Cohen that Mr. Tillerson needed to give a major speech in Washington shortly before Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration that would lay out a strategy in line with political reality.Mr. Cohen, he said, told him that the company would support action, but that it would back a carbon tax, not cap and trade.Mr. Freeman said he pressed the point: \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have the credibility to put forward a carbon tax when that\u2019s not on the table. You\u2019re going to have to embrace cap and trade if you\u2019re going to be seen as credible.\u201d But Mr. Cohen, he recalled, told him that cap and trade, by creating marketplaces for fuel producers, utilities and other large businesses for exchanging carbon credits, would create a windfall for emissions traders.Mr. Cohen declined to comment.In January 2009, Mr. Tillerson gave his speech at the Wilson Center. He warned that any system based on trading credits would lead to speculation and a \u201cnew Wall Street of emissions brokers.\u201dWhile Mr. Tillerson\u2019s Exxon has stopped funding several groups that loudly denied climate science, it still funds organizations that pursue a broader agenda of fighting measures to address climate change, including carbon taxes.Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian, said the positions held by the company and Mr. Tillerson still constitute climate denial, but in a \u201cclever and sophisticated\u201d form. \u201cIt is, in my view, what makes it more concerning,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause many people don\u2019t scratch the surface to see what lies beneath.\u201dPeter C. Frumhoff, the director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, characterized Exxon\u2019s stance as, \u201cWe agree with the I.P.C.C. on climate science \u2014 except where it\u2019s inconvenient.\u201d The Senate hearings on Mr. Tillerson, he said, should be a public trial on Exxon\u2019s history of studying climate science while spreading doubt about the underlying science and the company\u2019s actions.Some hard-line deniers of the overwhelming scientific evidence for climate change have said they, too, were uncomfortable with Mr. Tillerson\u2019s positions on climate change, fearing he may be too soft.\u201cA deeper examination of Tillerson,\u201d he said, \u201creveals a man who is not going to be a friend of the climate-change movement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Lessons From Argentina", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe United States should not turn away from Latin America as many populist contingents, both Republican and Democratic, have suggested. Instead, we would be well served to model our economic policy off the experiences of an unlikely economic role model: Argentina.For the last decade, the populist policies of the Kirchner regimes in Argentina led to inflation of over 40 percent, a painful recession, high unemployment and social unrest.Worryingly, the four main economic policies that defined Argentina\u2019s lost decade of populism have been adopted or are actively being considered in some form or other in Washington: protectionist trade policies, aggressively loose central bank policy, oppressive government regulations and a government spending spree.First, protectionist policies in Argentina destroyed the very agricultural and manufacturing heartland they were intended to help. The aim was to become self-reliant on domestic production and penalize those who exported or imported goods. Soy export tariffs, for example, eventually reached 50 percent, terminally crippling the crown jewel of Argentina\u2019s once thriving agricultural sector.By the same token, import restrictions started small-scale trade wars, and by 2015 trade conflicts erupted with more than 40 different countries. This left the domestic agricultural and manufacturing sectors in disarray. As recently as 2002, Argentina had a trade surplus of 16 percent of gross domestic product, but after more than a decade of protectionism, the entire surplus was erased, and 2015 ended in a deficit.Second, looking for easy sources of growth and debt financing, the government turned to the central bank. Destroying its supposed independence, the government influenced it to aggressively loosen policy. The result: Inflation exceeded 40 percent, hurting growth instead of helping it.Third, oppressive regulations strangled the private sector. The government began controlling things like the price of gas, the value of the exchange rate and nationalization of the private pension system. Artificially distorted prices at first led industry to stop new investment and, later, to stop production altogether. Huge shortages developed. For example, although Argentina has significant natural energy resources, government regulation created huge energy deficits because artificially set prices and burdensome regulation made private investment completely infeasible.An adversarial position toward the financial services industry caused problems like prolonged disputes with creditors and the nationalization of private companies \u2014 all of which shut Argentina off from international capital markets.Finally, with the private sector economy in shambles, the government embarked on a spending spree in an attempt to bolster growth. In 2003, when its populist fiscal policies first came into force, the government spent 93 billion pesos annually. By 2015, this soared to about 2.4 trillion pesos annually, mostly in the form of income transfers.While this initially bought popular support, the government eventually ran out of money with little to show for its largess, as average annual G.D.P. growth was a meager 0.3 percent between 2011 and 2015.With economic activity at a standstill, unemployment surging and inflation spiraling out of control, the populist regime finally lost the support it had mortgaged the future to maintain. In 2015, the country endorsed the end of populism, electing President Mauricio Macri to put into effect orthodox economic policy and bring the lost decade to a close.Export tariffs and price controls have begun to be lifted, and the adversarial approach to private sector investors has been reversed. Exports can now bring in much-needed foreign currency, help stabilize the value of the peso over the long term and lower food prices.Once ostracized, Argentina just this year has attracted over $20 billion in foreign investment into the government bond market alone. Investments in the private sector are also underway.A highly credible central bank governor and board have been put in place and allowed to exercise independent monetary policy. Raising the central bank reference rate to 38 percent demonstrates technical understanding of what is required to fight inflation, and highlights the central bank\u2019s newfound ability to pursue policies that may be politically unpopular but are wholly necessary to ensure long-term macro stability. The government has also adopted prudently tight fiscal policies; an overhaul package recently passed the lower house with a two-thirds majority.Credible fiscal and monetary policy has, for the first time, begun to anchor and bring down inflation expectations, thus lowering domestic interest rates. This has allowed the domestic financial market to re-emerge and begin to both raise and deploy capital to an economy starved of investment.While Argentina\u2019s future looks bright, arriving at this new regime required a long, painful economic and social crisis.The United States can choose to follow the path of Argentina\u2019s failed populist experiment to varying degrees. Or, we can use the experience of Argentina as a crystal ball and avoid the damaging consequences of populist economic policies.We can choose instead to adopt the remedies Argentina found necessary to begin to create jobs and raise living standards: Eliminate heavy-handed government intervention, ensure we have an outward-looking trade policy, follow fiscally and monetarily prudent policies and promote, rather than stymie, private sector investment.Dr. Michael Hasenstab is executive vice president, portfolio manager and chief investment officer of Templeton Global Macro.Advertisement"}

Freedom has declined worldwide for the 11th straight year, according to Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization.Many countries that seemed to be transitioning to democracy, like Egypt, Turkey, Thailand and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are backsliding; among the encouraging exceptions are Myanmar, Nigeria and Tunisia.

Once hailed as a boon, it\u2019s increasingly regarded as a threat \u2014 to security, to cultural identity, to the economy.Globalization has helped hundreds of millions to escape poverty, lowered the costs of manufactured goods for consumers around the world and afforded unprecedented mobility. But it has also increased inequalities within countries and reduced the power of governments to control their borders and their economies.Globalization makes the world more interdependent, while political systems remain national. Candidates for high office usually campaign on domestic issues, but after they win, they find themselves grappling with complex international issues over which they exercise limited control, making their election promises difficult to fulfill.These failures to deliver have created the impression of loss of sovereignty. Take the case of Europe. The European Union, the world\u2019s most ambitious attempt to adapt democracy to the growing global interconnectedness, is fraying. Many Europeans, faced with the flood of migrants and shaken by terror attacks, want to close their borders. But a fortress mentality is likely to limit their capacity to influence what\u2019s outside the walls. A country in the European Union that\u2019s acting alone isn\u2019t as powerful as one that\u2019s part of the group.The union was never about ceding sovereignty, as Brexiters in Britain argued, but about pooling it. However, many observers question the union\u2019s future, given its perceived failures in the face of the Great Recession of 2008, the European debt crisis and the desperate migrants at its borders.Globalization also tends to divide societies into winners and losers. While a few individuals and organizations \u2014 including organized crime \u2014 have amassed unprecedented wealth (and managed to minimize taxes thanks to global markets and capital mobility), countless more people in the West have seen their incomes stagnate. Globalization doesn\u2019t seem to be raising all boats. Populists like Donald J. Trump in America, Marine Le Pen in France and Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom have exploited this situation for partisan purposes.Though authoritarian leaders, democracy\u2019s eternal critics, also use the language of muscular nationalism as they grapple with globalization, they too are dependent on the global economy, which limits their room to maneuver. Such leaders may be less vulnerable to the vagaries of public opinion, but they are usually beholden to powerful and opaque groups, such as army generals, party apparatchiks and oligarchs.In periods of upheaval, authoritarian systems may look attractive because of the quick decision-making they allow. However, the ability of such systems to make snap decisions on the whims of just one man has historically led to catastrophes that wouldn\u2019t be possible in democracies, which are burdened but also protected by checks and balances.Our appreciation of democracies can be warped by uneven information. Authoritarian regimes tend to look better than they are because information is controlled, criticism is suppressed and a steady stream of propaganda creates a false sense of popularity; democracies tend to look worse because their media, civil societies and politicians all magnify their problems. In reality, authoritarian systems are brittle in the face of change, and democracies more resilient thanks to their fundamental legitimacy, accountable governance and the safety valves afforded by freedom of expression.The World Values Survey has repeatedly shown that the desire for free choice and autonomy is a universal preference, tempered only by an overriding concern about security. Politicians with authoritarian tendencies exploit that concern by playing the politics of fear. Adversaries, real or imagined, are their best defense against their people\u2019s natural aspiration for greater freedom.To harness this aspiration, just about every country around the world stages elections, but even where the result is predetermined, leaders claim to be ruling on their people\u2019s behalf. Elections aren\u2019t truly democratic if they\u2019re not inclusive, transparent and accountable. They don\u2019t confer genuine legitimacy, as was seen last year in Burundi, where the violence-marred re-election of President Pierre Nkurunziza hasn\u2019t resolved the country\u2019s political crisis.When political rivals and their supporters don\u2019t believe that the electoral process is free and fair, they seek less peaceful methods to change political direction and leadership. If the street isn\u2019t to take the place of the ballot box, credible elections are essential.We should promote legitimate elections around the world \u2014 not only because we think that democracy is ethically superior to other forms of government, but also because it delivers better results. It holds the best promise for peace, development and respect for human rights and the rule of law.So how do we help democracies to flourish as globalization progresses? The best way is not to \u201cexport democracy,\u201d as George W. Bush\u2019s administration, for example, directed American troops to do in Iraq and elsewhere, but rather to inspire people to import it by demonstrating that democracy works.Democracy-building begins at home. Democratic leaders must be honest with their electorates about a globalized world\u2019s rewards and constraints. They must also make sure that those rewards are widely shared, which requires that the wealthy be effectively taxed so that everybody benefits from those rewards. Finally, democratic leaders should be responsive to the priorities of the many, not just the few who contribute to campaigns or hire lobbyists.But those citizens fortunate enough to live in democracies also have responsibilities: They must channel their political aspirations and grievances in constructive ways rather than merely indulge in destructive protest or electoral apathy. Democracy is only as strong as its citizens make it. We can\u2019t have healthy, responsive democracies where large swaths of the population don\u2019t vote. Tweeting isn\u2019t enough.With the collapse of the Soviet Union 25 years ago, it seemed inevitable that democracy would prevail \u2014 the market democracies that had triumphed over communism were also the world\u2019s most prosperous and free societies. Democracy can seem less appealing in a time of stagnating incomes, social inequality and terror, especially in situations where money is having a disproportionate influence on politics. And yet citizens\u2019 movements in societies as disparate as Burkina Faso, Hong Kong and Venezuela show that democratic aspirations around the world remain vital.I sometimes hear that democracies have lost their sense of purpose. This isn\u2019t so. Democracy\u2019s purpose is to create conditions in which free citizens can lead the most fulfilling lives possible that they themselves choose. Human beings need not only livelihoods and security but also freedom, dignity and justice.Democracy, whatever its flaws, is the political system that can best respond to those needs. May next year\u2019s elections bring positive news for democracy, with all the gifts it can provide.Kofi Annan, who served as secretary-general of the United Nations from 1997 to 2006, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with the United Nations in 2001.

Some lined up before dawn on Wednesday to cast their ballots. Others huddled around radios in the dimly lit streets of Accra on Wednesday night, listening as election officials hoarsely read results polling station by polling station.The wait for results to come in dragged on, and pressure mounted on the electoral commission to speed up the counting process throughout Friday. The African Union had called on the commission \u201cto expedite announcement of remaining results in order to address the growing anxiety caused by the delay.\u201dElection observers praised Ghana for what they generally deemed to be a transparent and fair contest.Abdullai Salifu, a 29-year-old salesman who came to Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s compound, said he would be celebrating on the streets of Accra all night. \u201cThis is the moment we have been waiting for\u201d for years, Mr. Salifu said with a broad smile.Advertisement"}

Shortly afterward, Mr. Hollande announced that he had named Bernard Cazeneuve as prime minister and had asked him to form a new government, to be announced later in the day.Mr. Cazeneuve, who replaced Mr. Valls as interior minister in 2014, is one of Mr. Hollande\u2019s more popular ministers, and he is well-respected across the political spectrum for his coolheaded response to terrorist attacks in France over the past two years.But with Mr. Hollande\u2019s term coming to a close and the presidential campaign ramping up, Mr. Cazeneuve will in all likelihood be a placeholder until the presidential elections end in the spring. The government is not expected to be reshuffled significantly or tasked with putting forward new policies.The most recent polls predicted that Mr. Valls would lead in the first round of voting in the primaries, to be held next month.But it is unclear how far he will get. The field on the left is crowded, with more than a dozen candidates running, and Mr. Valls is a divisive figure who could struggle to rally leftist rivals, including some of his former ministers.In his announcement speech, Mr. Valls acknowledged that the left was divided. He brought up the memory of 2002, when the far-right National Front candidate came in ahead of the Socialist Party candidate in presidential elections. Mr. Valls said he did not want France to \u201crelive this trauma.\u201d\u201cWe are told that the far right will automatically reach the second round, but nothing is written in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are told that Fran\u00e7ois Fillon is the next president of the republic, but nothing is written in advance.\u201d\u201cOur lives are worth more than their forecasts,\u201d he said.He sought to strike a more diplomatic tone in his announcement speech, calling his candidacy one of \u201creconciliation.\u201d\u201cIn my drive to make my political family evolve, I have, at times, used harsh words, provoked debates and incomprehension,\u201d Mr. Valls said. \u201cOf course, each and every one of us is different. But we are together.\u201dMr. Valls said he would step down to prepare for the January primaries, which are open, meaning that leftist parties other than the Socialists are fielding candidates and that voters do not need to be card-carrying party members to participate. Mr. Hollande is expected to appoint a new prime minister and shuffle his cabinet in the coming days.Mr. Valls worked for several Socialist ministers before becoming mayor of \u00c9vry in 2001.

{"Headline": "Obama Strikes Back at Russia for Election Hacking", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama struck back at Russia on Thursday for its efforts to influence the 2016 election, ejecting 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on Russia\u2019s two leading intelligence services.The administration also penalized four top officers of one of those services, the powerful military intelligence unit known as the G.R.U.Intelligence agencies have concluded that the G.R.U. ordered the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, with the approval of the Kremlin, and ultimately enabled the publication of the emails it harvested to benefit Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign.The expulsion of the 35 Russians, who the administration said were spies posing as diplomats and other officials, and their families was in response to the harassment of American diplomats in Russia, State Department officials said. It was unclear if they were involved in the hacking.Taken together, the sweeping actions announced by the White House, the Treasury, the State Department and intelligence agencies on Thursday amount to the strongest American response yet to a state-sponsored cyberattack. They also appeared intended to box in President-elect Trump, who will now have to decide whether to lift the sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies when he takes office next month.President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for trying to influence the 2016 election through cyberattacks. Here\u2019s what led to the sanctions.Mr. Trump responded to the Russian sanctions late Thursday by reiterating a call to \u201cmove on.\u201d But he pledged to meet with intelligence officials, who have concluded that the Russian hacking was an attempt to tip the election to Mr. Trump.In an earlier statement from Hawaii, Mr. Obama took a subtle dig at Mr. Trump, who has consistently cast doubt on the intelligence showing that the Russian government was deeply involved in the hacking. \u201cAll Americans should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s actions,\u201d Mr. Obama said, and added that the United States acted after \u201crepeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior.\u201dHe issued a new executive order that allows him, and his successors, to retaliate for efforts to influence elections in the United States or those of \u201callies and partners,\u201d a clear reference to concern that Russia\u2019s next target may be Germany and France. Already there are reports of influence operations in both.Mr. Trump\u2019s position is at odds with most members of his party, who after classified briefings have called for investigations into the combination of cyberattacks and old-style information warfare used in the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump has largely stuck to the theory he set forth in a debate with Hillary Clinton in September, when he said the hacks could have been organized by \u201csomebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\u201dThe F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security released a report on Thursday detailing the ways that Russia acted to influence the American election through cyberespionage.Russia criticized the sanctions and vowed retaliation.\u201cSuch steps of the U.S. administration that has three weeks left to work are aimed at two things: to further harm Russian-American ties, which are at a low point as it is, as well as, obviously, deal a blow on the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the president-elect,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters.Konstantin Kosachyov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian Parliament, told Interfax that \u201cthis is the agony not even of \u2018lame ducks,\u2019 but of \u2018political corpses.\u2019\u201dDespite the international fallout and political repercussions surrounding the announcement, it is not clear how much effect the sanctions will have, except on the ousted diplomats, who have until midday Sunday to leave the country. G.R.U. officials rarely travel to the United States, or keep assets here.The four Russian intelligence officials are Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the chief of the G.R.U., and three deputies: Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, Igor Olegovich Kostyukov and Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev.The administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations: the Special Technology Center, a signals intelligence operation in St. Petersburg, Russia; a firm called Zorsecurity that is also known as Esage Lab; and the Autonomous Noncommercial Organization Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems, whose lengthy name, American officials said, was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking.The sanctions are not as biting as previous ones in which the United States and its Western allies took aim at broad sectors of the Russian economy and blacklisted dozens of people, some of them close friends of Mr. Putin\u2019s. Those sanctions were in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea and its activities to destabilize Ukraine. Mr. Trump suggested in an interview with The New York Times this year that he believed those sanctions were useless, and left open the possibility he might lift them.The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday also released samples of malware and other indicators of Russian cyberactivity, including network addresses of computers commonly used by the Russians to start attacks. But the evidence in a report, in which the administration referred to the Russian cyberactivity as Grizzly Steppe, fell short of anything that would directly tie senior officers of the G.R.U. or the F.S.B., the other intelligence service, to a plan to influence the election.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.A more detailed report on the intelligence, ordered by Mr. Obama, will be published in the next three weeks, though much of the information \u2014 especially evidence collected from \u201cimplants\u201d in Russian computer systems, tapped conversations and spies \u2014 is expected to remain classified.Several Obama administration officials, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have suggested that there may also be a covert response, one that would be obvious to Mr. Putin but not to the public.While that may prove satisfying, many outside experts have said that unless the public response is strong enough to impose a real cost on Mr. Putin, his government and his vast intelligence apparatus, it might not deter further activity.\u201cThey are concerned about controlling retaliation,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.But John P. Carlin, who recently left the administration as the chief of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, where he assembled cases against North Korean, Chinese and Iranian hackers, called the administration\u2019s actions a \u201csignificant step that is consistent with a new model: When you violate norms of behavior in this space, we can figure out who did it and we can impose consequences.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Obama decided that the authorities he created in April 2015 to retaliate against states or individuals that conduct hacking after the Sony attack did not go far enough. They made no provision issuing sanctions in response to an incursion on the electoral system \u2014 an attack few saw coming.So he ordered his lawyers to amend the executive order, specifically giving himself and his successor the authority to issue travel bans and asset freezes on those who \u201ctamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\u201dThe administration has not publicly criticized how its own officials handled the case. But the Times investigation revealed that the F.B.I. first informed the Democratic National Committee that it saw evidence that the committee\u2019s email systems had been hacked in the fall of 2015. Months of fumbling and slow responses followed.Mr. Obama said at a news conference that he was first notified early this summer. But one of his top aides met Russian officials in Geneva to complain about activity in April.By the time the leadership of the committee woke up to what was happening, the G.R.U. had not only obtained emails through a hacking group that has been closely associated with it for years, but, investigators say, also allowed them to be published on a number of websites, including a newly created one called DC Leaks and the far more established WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, several states reported the \u201cscanning\u201d of their voter databases \u2014 which American intelligence agencies also attributed to Russian hackers. But there is no evidence, American officials said, that Russia sought to manipulate votes or voter rolls on Nov. 8.Mr. Obama decided not to issue sanctions earlier for fear of Russian retaliation ahead of Election Day. Some of his aides now believe that was a mistake. But the president made clear before leaving for Hawaii that he planned to respond.Articles on Friday about the Obama administration\u2019s decision to close two Russian-owned compounds in the United States misidentified one of the compounds, using information from the White House and F.B.I. officials. The administration ordered the closure of Norwich House in Upper Brookville, N.Y., owned by Russia \u2014 not the nearby Killenworth Mansion in Glen Cove, N.Y., also owned by the Russians. An accompanying picture that showed Killenworth Mansion should have been of Norwich House.Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Market and the \u2018Trump Effect\u2019: What Do the Tea Leaves Say?", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseSo much for the \u201cJanuary barometer.\u201dDuring the first five trading days of this year, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 6 percent, the worst start to a new year ever for investors.For all of January, it dropped 5.5 percent, the worst January since 2009 and the depths of the financial crisis.For followers of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac and others who look for patterns in the stock market, those were resounding portents of financial doom.\u201cAs January goes, so goes the entire market year,\u201d is one of the best-known aphorisms from the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, an annual compilation of dates, statistics and advice for investors that was first published in 1968 by Yale Hirsch.Moreover, in presidential election years, the almanac posits that the market\u2019s performance during the first five days of trading will determine if the market ends up or down for the year.But after a major postelection rally, the market was a hair\u2019s breadth away from the milestone of 20,000 on the Dow, and the S.&P. 500-stock index and Nasdaq were also setting records. The Dow was up 12 percent for the year, the S.&P. 500 was up in excess of 9 percent, and the Nasdaq gained nearly 8 percent.No barometer, of course, is always right. But over the last 10 years, the January barometer gave false negative indications in 2014, 2010 and 2009, and a false positive in 2011. With its spectacular failure this year, it has been right just 50 percent of the time over the last decade \u2014 which means it is essentially worthless as a predictor.Jeff Hirsch, Yale Hirsch\u2019s son and now editor and publisher of the almanac, acknowledged this week that both barometers had missed the mark this year, but said their long-term record remained intact and that they had accurately anticipated the correction that bottomed out in February. In any event, he has never said that investors should rely solely on the almanac\u2019s predictions in making investment decisions.Human nature being what it is, that\u2019s not likely to stop investors from searching for predictive patterns, such as the relationship between stock performance and presidential elections, which has produced a bullish signal this year.The almanac points out that during the years of a Republican president and a Republican majority in both the House and Senate, the S.&P. 500 has risen on average 14.1 percent. (The market\u2019s track record for a Democratic president and Republican House and Senate is even better at 16.4 percent, on average.)We\u2019re now in the midst of what some are calling the \u201cTrump effect,\u201d which posits that stocks are poised to soar even more, not just because of historical patterns, but thanks to a new business- and investor-friendly Trump administration.\u201cIf this guy pulls it together and really creates some change, if we see some political functionality and he pushes some constructive things through despite his rants and diatribes, we could be at the start of a superboom cycle,\u201d Mr. Hirsch told me. Then again, he continued, \u201cif he fumbles this, then all bets are off.\u201dBelievers in the Trump effect have gained confidence from the powerful market rally that kicked in after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory.This week I asked James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, to compare the market\u2019s performance during the 34 days since the election with every other election year going back to 1928. He told me the postelection rise in the S.&P. 500 of 5.5 percent through Monday was the best ever.But whether further gains are ahead is an open question. Mr. Stack pointed out that all presidential election correlations are of dubious predictive validity because the database is too small; from 1916 through Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, there have been just 26 presidential elections over the last 100 years.In heavily blue places (like Manhattan), there\u2019s an entirely different Trump effect: the belief he\u2019s about to take the economy over a cliff. Investors who support that idea should dump stocks and retreat to the safety of government bonds \u2014 though the safety of even those may be suspect, given Mr. Trump\u2019s past threat to renege on the national debt.This camp, too, can point to historical precedent. After the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, the S.&P. 500 ran up 9.2 percent by the end of November, the biggest, fastest postpresidential election gain ever. The honeymoon didn\u2019t last long: We all know what happened in 1929.Mr. Trump himself has emerged as a bearish stock market prognosticator, declaring during the first presidential debate in September, \u201cWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.\u201d If so, it has only gotten fatter since.To help navigate these conflicting signals, I turned to Burton Malkiel, emeritus professor of economics at Princeton and author of the classic \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investment.\u201dMr. Malkiel\u2019s advocacy of the efficient market theory, his many years as a director of the mutual fund giant Vanguard, and his current position as chief investment officer for the automated investment firm Wealthfront have all contributed to the rise of so-called passive investing.\u201cThe problem with all these data people is that you can find correlations anywhere,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cMy favorite is milk production in Bangladesh,\u201d which, according to one academic study, explains 99 percent of movements in the S.&P. 500. \u201cIt\u2019s true the stock market has done better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones,\u201d he said. \u201cBut is that just a spurious correlation? In all likelihood, it is.\u201d\u201cI hear all the time that the market has gone crazy since the election,\u201d Mr. Malkiel continued. \u201cIs the market too high now? I have no idea, and neither does anyone else. I\u2019ve been around a long time. One thing I can tell you for sure is that nobody, and I mean nobody, can consistently time the market.\u201dAt the same time, he doesn\u2019t consider it irrational that the market has surged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\u201cPeople who think Trump is going to take us over a cliff don\u2019t have any superior knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll do something really stupid on trade and the economy will go over a cliff. It\u2019s a possibility. But it\u2019s also a possibility that we\u2019re going to have stronger economic growth. My own view is that we\u2019re going to have better real growth in 2017 than 2016, maybe not 4 percent, but 3 percent, absolutely. It\u2019s not completely nonsensical for the market to be up.\u201dSo what should investors \u2014 of whatever political leanings \u2014 do now?Mr. Stack said he was telling clients to be cautious, not because of any views about a Trump presidency, but because valuations are getting stretched and the bull market is now the second-longest in the last 85 years.\u201cThat makes me nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned over 40 years of investing is that profit opportunities always come around if you\u2019re patient. Don\u2019t be lured in because you\u2019re afraid the Dow is going through 20,000 and you\u2019ll be left behind. There is no last train out of the station.\u201dMr. Malkiel urged investors to ignore their feelings about a Trump presidency. \u201cWhether you think Trump will be wildly successful or he\u2019ll be a disaster, don\u2019t try to move in or out of assets because you think you know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Malkiel advised. He said investors should be broadly diversified, stick to their asset allocation plans and rebalance periodically. \u201cAnd by all means, keep expenses low.\u201dNext up on the calendar: the so-called Santa Claus rally, which posits that stocks tend to rise during the last five trading days of the calendar year and the first two trading days of the next, and if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s a harbinger of bad times.As Yale Hirsch described the phenomenon, \u201cIf Santa Claus would fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201dThat, too, proved wildly off base last year.The Common Sense column on Dec. 16, about the performance of stock markets in presidential election years, referred incorrectly to gains in Standard & Poor\u2019s when the same party has controlled the White House and the Congress. A gain of 14.1 percent in the index was the average for all years with a Republican president and Congress, while a 16.4 percent gain was the average for all years with a Democratic president and Congress; the figures are not for just the first calendar year of such administrations.Advertisement"}

Budget directors can also employ the \u201cmagic asterisk\u201d (popularized by David Stockman, the budget director for President Ronald Reagan), which is used to denote unspecified budget cuts that will someday, somehow offset projected deficits.At this juncture, it is impossible to know how Mr. Mulvaney will get Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers to add up.

{"Headline": "Trump Sealed Carrier Deal With Mix of Threat and Incentive", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The long-promised call from Donald J. Trump to the heating and cooling giant Carrier came early one morning about a week after the election, when he unexpectedly won the industrial heartland.The president-elect warned Gregory Hayes, the chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, that he had to find a way to save a substantial share of the jobs it had vowed to move to Mexico, or he would face the wrath of the incoming administration.On Thursday, as he toured the factory floor here to take credit for saving roughly half of the 2,000 jobs Indiana stood to lose, Mr. Trump sent a message to other businesses as well that he intended to follow through on his pledges to impose stiff tariffs on imports from companies that move production overseas and ship their products back to the United States.\u201cThis is the way it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cCorporate America is going to have to understand that we have to take care of our workers also.\u201dMr. Trump was accompanied by his vice president-elect, Mike Pence, who is currently Indiana\u2019s governor. He was in the room at Trump Tower when the president-elect placed his initial call to Mr. Hayes, and he was the one who sealed the deal with the chief executive with a handshake in the building on Monday.How the president-elect\u2019s deal measures up to U.S. manufacturing job losses.\u201cI don\u2019t want them moving out of the country without consequences,\u201d Mr. Trump said, even if that means angering the free-market-oriented Republicans he beat in the primaries but will have to work with on Capitol Hill.\u201cThe free market has been sorting it out and America\u2019s been losing,\u201d Mr. Pence added, as Mr. Trump interjected, \u201cEvery time, every time.\u201dBut since the pact was disclosed on Tuesday, critics have pounced on Carrier\u2019s receipt of $7 million in incentives from the state of Indiana \u2014 just the kind of corporate giveaways Mr. Trump knocked as he slammed Carrier on the campaign trail last spring.Others have pointed out that cutting individual deals with different companies is a costly and ineffective way to stem the powerful forces that impel business to move factories and jobs in a highly competitive global and national economy.\u201cHe has signaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote in an op-ed on Thursday for The Washington Post.In Washington, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, suggested that Carrier\u2019s decision, while \u201cgood news,\u201d was only a drop in the bucket.\u201cMr. Trump would have to make 804 more announcements just like that to equal the standard of jobs in the manufacturing sector that were created in this country under President Obama\u2019s watch,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cSo this is good news, but the incoming president has a high bar to meet when it comes to putting in place the kind of economic policies that would benefit American workers.\u201d\u201cContrary to early reactions from the left and the right, the Carrier deal opens the door to a new approach to U.S. economic growth policy that is sorely needed,\u201d the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and advocacy group, said in a statement. \u201cIt sets the precedent that growing, attracting and retaining globally traded, innovation-based industries that are both high-value and pay high wages is central to U.S. economic growth.\u201dDespite the cheers Mr. Trump received as he walked around the factory floor, where the lines continued to run and he had to shout at times to be heard, another 1,000 workers for the company in Indiana will be losing their jobs.This includes 700 at a United Technologies factory in nearby Huntington, as well as several hundred here. The 800 or so jobs that are being preserved are mostly on the lines that build medium- and high-efficiency gas furnaces.Not long after Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence departed for the airport and to another rally in Ohio to celebrate his victory, workers coming in for the night shift received a letter titled \u201cCompany Update on Indianapolis Operations.\u201d\u201cWhile this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with the expected completion by the end of 2017.\u201dUnited Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent, saw the writing on the wall as soon as Mr. Trump declared victory last month. Offering to preserve jobs, even at the cost of some of the $65 million savings the company expected from the move, could serve its larger corporate interests.\u201cEvery penny counts, but if we step back and I\u2019m looking at earnings of $6.60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-elect listens to some of the company\u2019s bigger concerns,\u201d said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York.And Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, while providing a carrot through the state incentives and promises of future business tax cuts, held an implicit stick: the threat of pulling federal contracts from Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies. Mr. Trump and his team were well aware that the amount United Technologies stood to lose in those contracts dwarfed the savings from moving some of its operations to Monterrey from Indiana.Despite only accomplishing half of what had been promised in the campaign, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence predicted that the number of jobs ultimately preserved could rise as Carrier follows through on its promise to invest more than $16 million in the state.That provision, plus the incentives, were worked out between Carrier and officials from the state of Indiana\u2019s economic development office, with Mr. Pence overseeing the process.The vice president-elect insisted that the incentives did not represent a giveaway on Mr. Trump\u2019s part, and claimed United Technologies had turned down a similar-size package of breaks in March.What made the difference, he said, was Mr. Trump\u2019s public pressure, as well his promise to cut corporate taxes and ease regulation.\u201cThese jobs were gone,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cI sat the executives down in my governor\u2019s office in the statehouse in early March. They said we aren\u2019t in a position to reconsider this in any way, shape or form.\u201dMr. Trump, too, played down the role of the incentives. And he said he did not directly raise the $5 billion to $6 billion in federal contracts United Technologies receives, much of it from the Pentagon.But company officials are acutely aware that its Pratt & Whitney unit, among other things, supplies jet engines to the Air Force\u2019s most advanced fighter and many other planes, making it much more vulnerable to political pressure than other, lesser-known manufacturers that have been steadily closing shop in the Midwest and moving production south of the border.\u201cIt may have a played a role in their equation,\u201d Mr. Trump allowed. \u201cI never mentioned it. I didn\u2019t feel I had to.\u201dWhat about the fact that Mr. Trump frequently sourced products for his properties overseas, along with some popular Trump-branded merchandise? Will he lead by example and buy more goods made in the U.S.A.?\u201cI buy thousands and thousands of TVs,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to, but they essentially don\u2019t make them in the U.S. You know the hats I do? It took us forever to find a company that can make a hat in the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Korea Enters Period of Uncertainty With President\u2019s Impeachment", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For her nearly four years in office, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea cooperated closely with the United States, particularly when it came to dealing with her volatile neighbor, North Korea.Yet her deep unpopularity \u2014 the result of a scandal over influence-peddling that led members of her own party to want to oust her \u2014 increases the odds that the next election will be won by an advocate of friendlier relations with China.Domestically, her undoing provides the latest example of how corruption remains entrenched at the top echelons of political and corporate life in South Korea, at a moment when the economy is slowing.Ms. Park suggested that she intended to fight her impeachment, telling cabinet members hours later that she would \u201ccalmly\u201d prepare for the court deliberations and giving no hint that she would resign.\u201cI am gravely accepting the voices of the people and the National Assembly, and I sincerely hope that the confusion will come to a satisfactory end,\u201d she said in remarks broadcast on national television.Thousands of people who had gathered outside the Parliament building in the frigid cold on Friday cheered when the news was announced.\u201cMy heart is beating so fast,\u201d said Han Joo-young, 47, who had come from Paju, north of the capital. \u201cI am so touched that people who are usually powerless can have so much power when they come together.\u201dA total of 234 lawmakers voted for impeachment, well over the required two-thirds threshold in the 300-seat National Assembly, the lone house of Parliament in South Korea. The vote was by secret ballot, but the results indicated that nearly half of the 128 lawmakers in Ms. Park\u2019s party, Saenuri, had joined the opposition in moving to oust her.Instead, she became the least popular leader since the country began democratizing in the late 1980s, according to recent polls. Critics said she was authoritarian and used state power to muzzle critics while shielded by a coterie of advisers.The last time South Koreans took to the streets to kick out an unpopular leader, in 1960, they had to fight bloody battles with police officers armed with rifles.That uprising forced Syngman Rhee, the country\u2019s founding and authoritarian president, to resign and flee into exile in Hawaii. Vice President Lee Ki-poong, a Rhee confidant who was at the center of a corruption scandal, and his family ended their lives in a group suicide as mobs approached their home in Seoul.In subsequent decades, when South Koreans demanded more democracy, their military dictators, including Ms. Park\u2019s father, brutally suppressed them through martial law, torturing and even executing their leaders.In 1987, violence erupted again as people took to the streets to demand free presidential elections, forcing the military government to back down.This time, in a sign of how far South Korea\u2019s democracy has matured, peaceful crowds achieved their goal without a single arrest. Increasingly large numbers of protesters gathered in the capital, including 1.7 million people on Saturday \u2014 the largest protest in South Korean history.Still, it is difficult to predict when and how the Constitutional Court will rule on Ms. Park\u2019s fate.Removing her would require the votes of at least six of the nine Constitutional Court judges. Among the current judges, six were appointed by Ms. Park or her conservative predecessor, or are otherwise seen as being close to her party.The process, which may include hearings, will buy time for Ms. Park\u2019s embattled party to recover from the scandal and prepare for the next presidential election if the court decides to formally unseat her.His and subsequent governments had favored a handful of family-owned conglomerates with tax benefits, lucrative business licenses and buy-Korean and anti-labor policies. The businesses were accused of returning the favors with bribes and suspicious donations.Through the years, top corporations have been rocked by recurring corruption scandals, including the one that implicated Ms. Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil.The scene was repeated this week, when nine business leaders, including Jay Y. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung, and Chung Mong-koo, the Hyundai chairman, appeared at another parliamentary hearing to be questioned about millions of dollars they gave to two foundations controlled by Ms. Choi.The businessmen acknowledged giving the money, confirming that the requests had come directly from Ms. Park or her aides.Huh Chang-soo, the chairman of GS Group and the head of the Federation of Korean Industries, the pro-business lobby group that coordinated the donations, put the situation this way: \u201cIt is difficult for businesses to say no to a request from the government. That\u2019s the reality in South Korea.\u201dSome analysts saw the vote and the huge protests as a repudiation of the entire system.\u201cThis impeachment is not only an impeachment against Park Geun-hye,\u201d said Kim Dong-choon, a professor of sociology at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul, \u201cbut a judgment against the conservative party and the post-Cold War order that has maintained power in South Korea for so many years.\u201dMotoko Rich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Plot is for novelists.\u201d In an interview given while \u201cPickpocket\u201d was in release, he asserted that \u201cfilms should not have subjects at all.\u201d\u201cImpossible tasks attract me,\u201d Bresson told Le Figaro in 1949. \u201cIt\u2019s good to create obstacles. I, at least, don\u2019t work well without obstacles,\u201d he said in a radio interview, conducted in English, at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, where \u201cThe Trial of Joan of Arc\u201d won a special jury prize. Five years later, he ended a conversation with the critic Georges Sadoul by musing, \u201cI wonder if my films are worth the effort they require.\u201d He might have meant require of himself, not his viewers.\u201cNotes on the Cinematograph\u201d (previously published here in 1977, in the same translation by Jonathan Griffin, as \u201cNotes on Cinematography\u201d) is the ultimate refinement of Bresson\u2019s thought, a loosely grouped succession of aphorisms and Zen koans (\u201cthe soundtrack invented silence\u201d). Both of these books give considerable attention to the use of the nonactors Bresson referred to as \u201cmodels.\u201d Beginning with \u201cDiary of a Country Priest,\u201d his actors do not act, they simply are.Asked how he directed his models, he replied: \u201cIt isn\u2019t about directing anyone, but about directing yourself. The rest is telepathy.\u201d (\u201cYou really feel he is trying to empty your mind,\u201d Dominique Sanda, one of the very few Bresson models to go on to an acting career, once explained in a documentary on Bresson.)In some respects, however, Bresson\u2019s sense of cinema was quite conventional. His statements acknowledge montage, or editing, as the medium\u2019s basic source of meaning. When he declares that \u201ccinema must express itself not with images, but with relationships between images\u201d or speaks in terms of visual rhythm, he is echoing the ideas of Sergei Eisenstein and the other Soviet theorists (although this is not something he seems to acknowledge). Like the Soviets as well, Bresson recognized sound as a material element, observing in \u201cNotes\u201d that \u201cthe noises must become music.\u201dThe interviews in \u201cBresson on Bresson\u201d are grouped chronologically and organized by film. Reading it, one can see Bresson refining his answers to the similar questions that inevitably arose with each new production, even as he refined his filmmaking style. (The interviews, which were edited and even redacted by Bresson before their original publication, mostly in French periodicals, are invariably sympathetic.)The longest and most substantial interview is a discussion with Mr. Godard and the actor Michel Delahaye, published in Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma upon the release of \u201cAu Hasard Balthazar.\u201d Here, Bresson admits to an obsession with what he calls the \u201cthe real\u201d and says that \u201cfake lighting is as treacherous as fake dialogue.\u201d These sentiments alone would establish him as a classic filmmaker.For Bresson, motion pictures \u2014 which, at least before the digital revolution, recorded what occurred before the camera \u2014 were a form of truth. His belief in movies as an intrinsically authentic, essentially documentary medium explains his statement that \u201cto bring the past back to the present\u201d is \u201cthe privilege of cinematography.\u201d The most spiritual of filmmakers was also the most devout of cinema realists.Bresson on BressonInterviews 1943-1983By Robert Bresson.

{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin, Unsurprised by Trump\u2019s Remarks, Says Russia Wants No Nuclear Arms Race", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byAsked about the American election, Mr. Putin, who has made no secret of his distaste for Hillary Clinton, said her defeat was a \u201chumiliation\u201d for the Democratic Party.The Russian president, speaking at his annual marathon news conference, also said that Russia would continue to modernize its armed forces, including nuclear weapons, but he added that the level of spending would diminish somewhat in coming years.He said Russia was not seeking a new arms race or to develop new nuclear warheads, but was instead seeking ways to improve its armaments so that they could pierce missile defenses. The deployment of NATO missile defense systems in countries near Russia has been a sore spot between Moscow and the West.\u201cOf course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,\u201d Mr. Putin said toward the beginning of the news conference, which typically lasts four hours or more.\u201cAs for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his election campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general,\u201d he added.Mr. Putin said that any new Russian nuclear weapons would stay within the limits of existing treaties. Although Moscow and Washington have taken to rattling sabers more than in the past, experts said that the architecture of previous nuclear arms treaties has so far held.In 2007, Russia spent 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, Mr. Putin said, but the figure grew to 4.7 percent in 2016. Russia spent about $52 billion on its military in 2015.He said that the proportion would gradually decline to 2.8 percent again by 2019. \u201cThis will not have an impact on our plan to increase our defense capabilities,\u201d he said.The budget cuts are being forced by an extended recession, though Mr. Putin tried to put a positive spin on that, as well. He said the overall economy had contracted 3.7 percent in 2015 and probably a further 0.5 to 0.6 percent in 2016, but that some sectors were expanding, like agriculture, which grew 4 percent.Some analysts have suggested that the growth in agriculture was nothing exceptional.Mr. Putin also noted other positive signs, including that inflation and capital outflows had slowed, but he said that there were still problems, including a drop in personal income for most Russians.On the American election, Mr. Putin said the Democrats were trying to blame their defeat on external factors like Russia. He said his popularity among American Republicans was not personal, but a reflection of their worldview.\u201cIt means that a significant part of the American people have the same perception about how the world should be developing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is good that people support us in this, in terms of traditional values.\u201d He said it was a good basis for improving Russian-American relations.Mr. Putin mocked recent statements by President Obama and others that former President Ronald Reagan would be turning in his grave over the support for Russia and for Mr. Putin among Republicans.If anything, he said, it would be former presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt who would be turning in their graves over the losses suffered by the Democratic Party.Mr. Roosevelt united the country, Mr. Putin said, but \u201cthe current administration divides it.\u201dAlthough Mr. Putin did not publicly endorse either candidate during the campaign, his administration made its preference for Mr. Trump clear. Among other reasons for disliking Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Putin has blamed her for the street demonstrations in Russia in 2011 and 2012 that greeted his return to the presidency, citing her endorsement of the protests while she was secretary of state to accuse her of fostering them.Asked directly about statements by Mr. Obama that he had warned Mr. Putin to stop hacking in the United States, Mr. Putin said that he would not reveal the contents of a private conversation.But he repeated statements by Mr. Trump that anyone could have done the hacking, including someone in the United States sitting on his couch. And Mr. Putin repeated his usual response to questions about the hacking, saying the main point was the contents of the emails and the light they shed on the Democrats\u2019 activities and plans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will the Trump Era Bring Higher Interest Rates? Don\u2019t Count On It", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBut what if that\u2019s wrong?The central bank will seek to prevent too much inflation from breaking out in an economy it believes is getting close to operating at its full potential, which means Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus might run up against the Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s (and perhaps her successor\u2019s) counter-stimulus.But it\u2019s worth looking at the two big ways that these forecasts could be wrong, and worth considering that the era of low rates might stick around a bit longer than some of the postelection discussion might have suggested.First, the Trump agenda might pack less of a growth punch than some have imagined. If so, you would expect the same cautious approach to rate increases from the Fed.Second, even if the economy does start growing faster, future Trump administration appointees could change their tune on the desirability of higher interest rates. That has been the pattern with other populist politicians of the Trump mold around the world. Politicians, once in office, tend to learn that they like low interest rates. It\u2019s easy to envision a Trump administration pushing for cheaper money and the Fed attempting to hold the line to prevent inflation.On the first point, it\u2019s worth diving into the details of the Trump policies that led to the postelection-day market rally in stocks and the sell-off in bonds.He wants to enact major tax cuts, for one, which all else being equal, would tend to create a short-term boost in economic growth and higher interest rates. But there are some early signals that the Republican lawmakers who actually have to pass any changes to tax law, especially those in the Senate, are wary of tax cuts that would increase the budget deficit as much as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plan would.Another big plank underneath the idea that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policy will be stimulative is an expectation that he will embrace a large-scale infrastructure spending package.But while the president-elect mentioned that idea in his election victory speech, he hasn\u2019t put much meat on the bones of the plan since. The details matter a great deal for how much an infrastructure plan could lift growth. For example, tax credits that make the finances of building toll roads more favorable are less likely to create a huge boost in activity than spending on upgrading physical infrastructure outright.And that\u2019s before you factor in the risk that some elements of Trump economic policy could end up being a drag on growth. Think of a trade war with China or Mexico, immigration restrictions that limit the supply of labor or geopolitical disputes.All that gives the Fed every reason to take a wait-and-see approach to shaping its policy. If the Trump economy really starts to take off, the Fed could move more aggressively to raise rates. But it will do that based on actual evidence and data rather than the president-elect\u2019s rhetoric.Which leads to the other scenario, in which the economy accelerates at the risk of overheating. History is littered with examples of politicians in that circumstance pressuring their central banks to keep rates low to encourage growth.There are two vacancies on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board of governors already, and Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman expires in February 2018; the vice-chairman Stanley Fischer\u2019s term is up in June of that year. Add it up, and within 18 months of taking office, Mr. Trump could have appointed a majority of the Fed\u2019s board, including its chair and vice chair.That doesn\u2019t mean that Trump nominees for those jobs would necessarily refrain from rate hikes if they believed they were warranted. Many potential Republican Fed nominees have opposed the low interest rate tendency of the Fed under Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke.For the past few administrations, the accepted practice has been that presidents should refrain from weighing in on monetary policy and let the Fed act independently. But Mr. Trump has described himself as a \u201clow interest rate person\u201d and was willing to scrap that precedent by attacking Ms. Yellen by name during the campaign.Also, to be technical about it, even if the Fed kept its short-term interest rate targets low despite rising inflation, long-term interest rates, which are determined by the bond market, would probably rise.If there\u2019s one thing we know about Mr. Trump, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t feel bound by the traditions that have governed how recent presidents have acted. And that means that the future of United States interest rate policy, like so much else, is up for grabs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Art Market: A Feel-Good Factor?", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 As we enter 2017, and the inauguration of Donald J. Trump looms, many sectors of the global economy are wondering what impact his presidency will have on their business. The art market is one of them.Detailed policies have yet to be decided, but Mr. Trump\u2019s stated commitments to reducing taxes and regulation, as well as to negotiating better trade deals and investing in infrastructure, have helped the Dow Jones industrial average climb to 19,833.68 at the close of trading on Dec. 28, about an 8.2 percent increase since Nov. 8.\u201cIf an art collector gets less of a tax hit, that\u2019s got to be helpful,\u201d said Candace Worth, an art adviser in New York.Otherwise, Mr. Rachofsky predicts Mr. Trump\u2019s effect on the art world will be \u201cneutral,\u201d while also noting, \u201cThe only thing that will be certain this year will be uncertainty.\u201dThis dichotomy \u2014 the financial security of the 1 percent contrasting with more general geopolitical nervousness \u2014 looks set to be the default mode of the art market for some time. As a result, both amateur and professional buyers, mindful of art\u2019s reputation as a financial safe haven, are concentrating on the proven so-called investment grade names of the postwar and contemporary periods.\u201cCollectors seemed to be congregated around blue chip galleries, acquiring selectively and focusing on more established artists,\u201d said Heather Flow, an adviser in New York, describing the dynamic at last month\u2019s Art Basel fair in Miami Beach. \u201cThe uncertainty and instability globally seems to weigh more heavily on collectors\u2019 minds than the prospect of a tax bill that could boost the after-tax income of the top 1 percent of highest-earning Americans,\u201d she added.The risk of speculating in young art was underlined in October when a 4-foot-high 2010 silver abstract by the New York painter Jacob Kassay sold for 25,000 pounds, or about $31,000, at a Sotheby\u2019s day auction in London. Back in 2011, when the market for Mr. Kassay was at its zenith, another 4-foot silver abstract from 2010 sold at a Phillips evening sale for $257,000.Artemundi said it maximized its returns \u2014 made during a period of steady, post-crash price rises \u2014 by buying and selling through low-fee private transactions, rather than public auctions. Such auctions usually extract double-digit commissions from both buyer and seller for works priced under $1 million.An increasing number of private collectors are taking a similar approach. \u201cThe auction houses have created some huge margins at the midlevel,\u201d said Mr. Rachofsky, the Dallas collector, who last year discreetly sold several six-figure works priced through dealers charging single-digit commissions. \u201cA lot of that trade is going to migrate to the private side.\u201dMany in this sector seem to agree on the probable effects of the new United States administration. Morgan Long, senior director of the Fine Art Group in London, said she thought Mr. Trump\u2019s policies would \u201clook after the interests of the 1 percent.\u201dBut what about the 99 percent, and the new art that is not being recycled in the great moneymaking machine of today\u2019s market?These will be the concerns of the 14th edition of the Documenta quinquennial, which is shaping up to be one of most talked-about art events of 2017.Adam Szymczyk, 46, a Polish art critic and Documenta\u2019s director, has taken the bold step of holding the event in the beleaguered city of Athens, as well as its traditional venue of Kassel in Germany. The Greek component of this sprawling multi-artist project will formally open in April, with the Kassel phase scheduled for June.\u201cWe are interested in something that extends beyond the dimensions of an exhibition,\u201d Mr. Szymczyk said. \u201cThis has the possibility of offering statements that aren\u2019t bound by dominant narratives. It\u2019s about telling stories in a different way, opening up minds to a different way of living.\u201dThis influential event could usher in a new phase of didactic art. Alternatively, thanks to dominant narratives like Mr. Trump, art could be about to get a lot more interesting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Was Barack Obama Bad for Democrats?", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsPresident Obama will be remembered as a thoughtful and dignified president who led a scrupulously honest administration that achieved major changes.People argue over whether his impatience with politicians and Republican intransigence denied him bigger accomplishments, but that argument is beside the point: He rescued an economy in crisis and passed the recovery program, pulled America back from its military overreach, passed the Affordable Care Act and committed the nation to addressing climate change. To be truly transformative in the way he wanted, however, his success had to translate into electoral gains for those who shared his vision and wanted to reform government. On that count, Mr. Obama failed.His legacy regrettably includes the more than 1,000 Democrats who lost their elections during his two terms. Republicans now have total control in half of America\u2019s states.Why such political carnage?Faced with the economy\u2019s potential collapse as he took office, Mr. Obama devoted his presidency to the economic recovery, starting with restoring the financial sector. But he never made wage stagnation and growing inequality central to his economic mission, even though most Americans struggled financially for the whole of his term.At the same time, Mr. Obama declined to really spend time and capital explaining his initiatives in an effective way. He believed that positive changes on the ground, especially from economic policies and the Affordable Care Act, would succeed, vindicating his judgment and marginalizing his opponents.Absent a president educating the public about his plans, for voters, the economic recovery effort morphed into bailouts \u2014 bank bailouts, auto bailouts, insurance bailouts. By his second year in office, he spotlighted the creation of new jobs and urged Democrats to defend our \u201cprogress.\u201dWhen President Obama began focusing on those \u201cleft behind\u201d by the recovery, he called for building \u201cladders of opportunity.\u201d That communicated that the president believed the country\u2019s main challenges were unrealized opportunity for a newly ascendant, multicultural America, rather than the continuing economic struggle experienced by a majority of Americans.Mr. Obama also offered only tepid support to the most important political actor in progressive and Democratic politics: the labor movement. In the absence of progressive funders in the mode of the conservative Koch brothers, unions are the most important actors at the state legislative level. Yet when the 2010 election ushered in a spate of anti-union governors, who eliminated collective bargaining rights for public employees and passed \u201cright to work\u201d laws, Mr. Obama never really joined this fight. In fact, he spent the last couple of years of his presidency pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, a free trade law vociferously opposed by the labor movement. Under President Obama, union membership has declined to 11.1 percent from 12.3 percent.While the Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 were models of innovation in online organizing and microtargeting, they did not translate into success in the midterm elections or in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Democratic turnout dropped in 2010, 2012 and significantly in 2014. Models, it appears, do not substitute for the hard work of organizing and engaging voters in nonpresidential years; models that apparently drove nearly every decision made by the Clinton campaign are no substitute for listening to voters.Finally, just as he governed, the campaign messages from the president in the midterms and in 2016 were focused on progress and growth.On the eve of the 2016 election, the president used the refrain: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen America turn recession into recovery\u201d and 15.5 million new jobs. Pointedly, he said, \u201cIncomes are rising. Poverty is falling.\u201dThe public\u2019s reaction was stark from the beginning. People did not believe his view on the economy, and his approval ratings fell in Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2010 and in Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2014 \u2014 the states that led the working-class move away from the Democrats.Mr. Obama did win re-election that year, though only after embracing Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s populist spirit and criticizing the \u201cbreathtaking greed of a few.\u201d He declared it a \u201cmake-or-break moment for the middle class.\u201d This posture did not animate his governing message or the 2016 presidential election. The president will leave office with a rising approval rating near the same league of Ronald Reagan, an economy nearing full employment and real wages tipping up. Yet a majority of voters in the last election said the economy was the top issue in their vote.We think voters were sending a clear message: They want more than a recovery. They want an economy and government that works for them, and that task is unfinished.Stanley B. Greenberg, the author of \u201cAmerica Ascendant,\u201d and Anna Greenberg are partners at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Would It Take to Replace the Pay Working-Class Americans Have Lost?", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewPoor and working-class Americans have fallen behind over the last generation, receiving few of the gains of an expanding economy. But we could change that by using one of the most powerful tools in the federal government\u2019s policy arsenal.President-elect Donald J. Trump says he will do this by using large tax cuts on business and to wealthy families to encourage more business investment, while aiming to create more high-paying jobs in construction and manufacturing by spending more on new infrastructure projects and renegotiating trade deals.But another, more direct approach is possible, one aimed at turbocharging the wages of people who have lost out on the economic gains of the last few decades. That could be done by expanding a tax credit that is already in place and enjoys bipartisan support. With the help of some smart policy wonks in Washington, I examined using tax policy this way. We found that it could work, but at no small cost.On the positive side: You could replace every dime of income that the bottom 20 percent of earners have lost compared with the average family since 1979 by radically expanding a tax credit. But the main problem is this: It would be really expensive, at more than $1 trillion over the next decade, and therefore a hard sell in any political environment.The lessons from this project have more relevance for the Trump administration \u2014 which isn\u2019t likely to embrace this kind of technocratic wonkery \u2014 than it might seem at first glance.Consider that Mr. Trump is betting on lower taxes on businesses and the investor class unleashing faster economic growth and preventing the budget deficit from skyrocketing. But he may want to consider hedging his bets. Policies that funnel direct benefits to lower-income workers might complement his trickle-down approach.Put another way, as long as you\u2019re cutting taxes by $6 trillion (that is the high-end direct cost estimate of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan from the Tax Foundation), carving out $1 trillion for workers who haven\u2019t seen large raises in years may just pay some dividends.The background is that economic growth has far outpaced income growth for decades. Gross domestic product for each person in the United States was 78 percent higher in 2015 than in 1979. But the average income for those households at the 20th percentile of the income distribution rose only 6.9 percent in that span.The reasons for this gap are endlessly debatable. Here are a few: The modern economy offers higher rewards for those with advanced education; globalization has diminished the prospects of the industries where working-class Americans once found lucrative jobs; a decline in the power of labor unions has left workers with less negotiating leverage.Whatever the true cause, it is clear that the tax code could fix at least some of the imbalance. And there is already a program on the books that supplements the take-home earnings of working-class Americans. It is the earned-income tax credit, often simply called the E.I.T.C., and it could be used much more aggressively.The earned-income tax credit already supplements the wages of people at the lower end of the pay scale, especially those with children. In its current form, for example, a married couple with two children that makes $30,000 a year receives a tax credit of $4,201.The earned-income tax credit is accepted across the political spectrum: Both President Obama and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, favor expanding it. It rewards only those who work, is efficiently administered through the tax code and phases out automatically as a person\u2019s income rises.How much more money in tax credits would be required to replace the income shortfall left by poorer people in recent decades?An increase in benefits also helps families with somewhat higher incomes. For example, a family of four making $40,000 would receive about $6,000 a year in this expanded E.I.T.C., compared with the $2,142 they get now. The benefits wouldn\u2019t completely phase out for a family of four until they hit nearly $70,000 of income.So what would it all cost? The Tax Policy Center crunched the numbers: The policy would deplete federal coffers by $1.02 trillion over a decade.That is serious money.There are many ways of raising it, none of them easy.If you wanted to soak the wealthy to pay for it, for example, you could enact a 5.6 percentage point surtax on families with income over $1 million, as Senate Democrats once proposed \u2014 yet that would cover only about 45 percent of the cost. If you favor a more business-friendly approach, you could give companies tax incentives to repatriate money they are stashing abroad. But that would get you only about 30 percent of the way there.So even if you conclude that a radical expansion of tax credits for working-class Americans is desirable, the politics of paying for it are somewhere between very hard and impossible. But that is where the Trump presidency comes in.But skeptics may argue that what ails the economy right now is inadequate demand for goods and services, and that working-class people don\u2019t have enough money. If they had extra cash in their pockets from an expanded E.I.T.C., they would be more likely than millionaires to spend the money, many economic studies suggest. That means that including help for the working class in any tax overhaul would add a \u201cdemand side\u201d source of economic growth.That won\u2019t solve the problems of working-class Americans. The dissatisfaction with the modern global economy that helped propel Mr. Trump to office is deep rooted. It involves a feeling of lost possibility that a bit of money alone won\u2019t solve. That is especially true for people who once saw manufacturing jobs as both a pathway to a middle-class income and a sense of purpose in life.But while technocratic solutions involving tweaking the tax code won\u2019t relieve the angst of Trump voters, if there are going to be big tax cuts in the months ahead, there is an economic rationale for spreading the benefits beyond the top.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fighter", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "FeatureThe Marine Corps taught Sam Siatta how to shoot. The war in Afghanistan taught him how to kill. Nobody taught him how to come home.Supported byIt was a few minutes after 2 a.m. on April 13, 2014. Siatta had just forced his way into a single-story home in Normal, Ill., a college town on the prairie about 130 miles southwest of Chicago. A Marine Corps veteran of the war in Afghanistan, he was a 24-year-old freshman studying on the G.I. Bill at the university nearby, Illinois State. He had a record of valor in infantry combat and no criminal past. He also had no clear reason to have entered someone else\u2019s home, no motive that prosecutors would be able to point to at trial \u2014 no intention to rob, no indication that he knew or had even seen before any of the three young female teaching students who lived inside, or the boyfriends who were with two of them.Two of the women and one of the men had awakened minutes earlier when they thought they heard someone opening and closing the front door. It had been an unnerving sensation, the feeling that an intruder had stepped into the home. They tried to settle themselves and return to bed, only to be jolted by a house-shaking bang \u2014 the sound of Siatta hitting the back door with such force that he splintered the jamb.The door swung open into a dining area. Siatta strode into the unfamiliar space, just around the block from the similarly sized home where he rented a room. A little more than six feet tall and weighing about 175 pounds, he was a thoroughly trained veteran of a small-unit ground war and heavily tattooed, with red tally marks on his sternum indicating seven Taliban kills from 2009 and 2010. His former company commander would later tell a trial judge that of the 388 troops he led in Afghanistan, Siatta was the man the militants feared most.The women cowered behind a flimsy bedroom door. One of them dialed 911. Another clutched a stubby kitchen knife.Since leaving the corps in 2012, Siatta had been unable to switch off the habits of war. He was hypervigilant and struggled to relax. He watched people, sizing them up and scanning for threats. In the varying situations of everyday life, he constantly repositioned himself so no one got behind him. Much of this was appropriate for combat patrols. Some of it drew from his training. All of it was mentally and emotionally exhausting, unsuited for a peaceful life. Going to a restaurant, moving through knots of people at a party, visiting the mall, finding a seat in a classroom relative to other people and windows and doors \u2014 each was a challenge requiring effort and will.Siatta had been in a deepening funk for months. For more than four years he had been stalked by memories of civilians his platoon had killed, people whose lives had abruptly ended for a reason as unforgiving as it was simple \u2014 being in the wrong place when the shooting began. The Department of Veterans Affairs would later say he suffered from depression, alcohol dependency and PTSD. But until this moment, he had adapted with behaviors allowing him to pass as less troubled than he was. He avoided crowds. He drank prodigious amounts of alcohol to dim his heightened alertness and to muffle his sorrows. He socialized rarely, often only with his mother or brother.The dining area Siatta had entered gave way to a little kitchen, which opened into a small living room. In that adjoining room, perhaps 25 feet from Siatta, stood one of the boyfriends, another young former Marine. In any number of situations, the two men might have become friends. But they had served in different places and jobs in the corps, and the man in the living room had no idea he had anything in common with the man in the kitchen. He positioned himself between his girlfriend and the shattered door.He was shorter than Siatta but more muscular, with a build hinting at years of weight training and competitive wrestling. He was also sober. He looked across the kitchen at the broken door. The deadbolt was still extended. Whoever had forced the door was strong. He heard movement around the corner, a rustling from the back of the house. He held a steak knife with a serrated eight-inch blade, the weapon he managed to muster in the seconds he had to think.Siatta stepped into his line of sight. He was walking toward the living room, deeper into the house.Only one man knows exactly what happened next. Knife in hand, he identified himself as a former Marine and demanded that Siatta get out.\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201dSiatta kept walking, the man said, and lifted a frying pan off the stove as he passed by. \u201cYou have been bad,\u201d he said, raising the pan by its handle. \u201cAnd this will do.\u201dWhatever options had existed narrowed to one. The fight began.Siatta walked in wearing blue prison garb. He had the light feet and muscular shoulders of a young fighter. His short sleeves offered glimpses of grim tattoos \u2014 a skull resting on an hourglass on his right forearm, among others \u2014 common to many grunts. He looked tough. He also looked deflated. He came off as nervous, scared and almost painfully polite, a man overwhelmed by his circumstances.Richard R. Winter, the attorney who days before had filed an appeal of Siatta\u2019s conviction, asked how he was doing. Any pretense of Siatta as a threat to visitors fell away. He was not doing well. Shawnee, he said, was run by gangs, which he had to take care not to cross. Two cellmates had been Latin Kings, and another was a sex offender who had almost drawn Siatta into a fight over a petty cellblock theft. The aging penitentiary in Pontiac, where he was held while awaiting a court hearing, was worse. There the inmates shouted and wailed through the night, he said, and the place was thick with rodents.Siatta seemed distraught. He wanted to go home. Did Winter have any news, he wanted to know, about his appeal? Winter gently said it would take time, perhaps a few months before they could expect a hearing.I had heard of Siatta in February, when T.G. Taylor, a recently retired Army officer, contacted me about a Marine infantry vet who had forced his way into a house in his neighborhood and been stabbed repeatedly by another former Marine. After a helicopter flight to a trauma center, the infantry vet \u2014 Siatta \u2014 was charged with home invasion, found guilty at trial and sentenced to prison. Taylor had taken a job at Holland & Knight, the firm handling the appeal, which was brought on the grounds that Siatta did not intend to commit the crime because he was almost catatonically intoxicated at the time. Siatta\u2019s case, Taylor said, was about PTSD, a subject he and I had discussed over the years as we tried to help friends struggling with life after war. I was interested but cautious. I served in the Marine infantry in the 1980s and 1990s and knew what everyone who has moved past the slogans knows: That a small fraction of Marines are trouble \u2014 problem children, in the gentlest construction of the corps\u2019 otherwise profane slang. Some of these Marines turn criminal and deserve every bit of punishment they get. I told Taylor that I would have to review the case carefully before considering coverage.By chance, I knew Maj. Scott A. Cuomo, who commanded Siatta\u2019s rifle company in Afghanistan. Cuomo is driven and serious. He had led the school that trains all Marine infantry lieutenants, a post reserved for established stars in the grunt officer corps. I called him with two questions: Was Siatta a problem child? If not, what was going on? Cuomo said Siatta was a solid Marine in combat \u2014 a gifted marksman, trusted by his peers, invaluable in firefights and deserving of gratitude, not incarceration. He said he was perplexed by everything he heard out of Illinois.Reading the case file raised more questions. The prosecutors had taken a hard stance against Siatta, first with charges and in plea negotiations and later in a deposition and in court, where a prosecutor belittled the idea that the accused might have been drunk as a coping mechanism for post-combat illness. Not everyone in the courtroom seemed to concur. At the end, when Siatta\u2019s life had finally tanked, the trial judge all but apologized for sentencing him to prison.I agreed to meet Siatta in Shawnee. Over a few hours of conversation, he toggled between being marginally expressive and almost poetic. At this late date he had developed a cleareyed view of what ailed him. He described his anxiety and drinking as conditions that grew almost imperceptibly, finally overtaking him in 2014. Until then the symptoms had been easy for him to play down, even if others were concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice when you grow half an inch, because you see yourself every day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you see your loved ones, they say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve gotten tall.\u2019\u2009\u201dOnce he relaxed, Siatta talked of the killing he had done in Afghanistan \u2014 hesitantly at first, then thoroughly \u2014 replaying the cool mechanics of precision rifle fire, describing fatal mistakes, tracing where his mind traveled after. His war had been darker than his new lawyer and family knew, more brutal than he expressed in court. It was too late to expect anything to come of it. More than five years remained on his sentence, and Siatta was unlikely to receive help from Illinois\u2019s overburdened correctional system in that time, not even counseling or medication. His fate would depend on a long-shot appeal, which focused on a narrow and not firmly established matter of law. In the waste and shame of a respected vet being warehoused in a penitentiary for a crime he could not recall was part of the foot soldiers\u2019 experience of the Afghan war, including the return to a country content to thank them without understanding them, or why they sometimes stand apart.As he stepped off the aircraft at Camp Leatherneck, a base on the steppe that served as a hub for Marine operations, he was an almost timeless character, a young Marine from the prairie who might have fit into the long lines of riflemen volunteering for his service\u2019s previous wartime campaigns. An adopted son in a Roman Catholic family in Illinois, he was handed to the couple who raised him on the Fourth of July in 1989, when he was 3 days old. His mother\u2019s eldest brother fought as a Marine in Vietnam, and his maternal grandfather was a Marine in World War II. By the time he was in the fourth grade, he was telling grown-ups that he intended to be a Marine.His father fell ill with cancer and died when Siatta was 12. Siatta had always been a quiet child and was more so after. A sixth-grade classmate, Ashley Volk, found him approachable and kind. The two dated that year. \u201cHe was my first kiss on the cheek,\u201d she said. Volk made a condolence card for their class to sign and puzzled over how he contained his grief. \u201cSam never cried in front of us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always made us scared for him, because we didn\u2019t know how he was dealing with it inside.\u201dBy eighth grade, Siatta had started lifting weights and hanging out at the gym. Volk worked out as an excuse to be near him. The war in Iraq was raging. The Pentagon\u2019s early success in Afghanistan was unraveling. Anyone could see there was much more fighting ahead, and against foes whose harassing and often dark tactics, emphasizing ambushes, improvised bombs and suicide attacks, were exacting a bloody toll. Siatta let it be known that he still intended to enlist.Siatta and Volk were an off-again, on-again couple in high school, years during which she tried to talk him out of becoming a Marine. He gave her nicknames, including \u201cpretty lady\u201d and \u201cgypsy,\u201d and resisted her efforts to dissuade him. As a senior he was old enough to sign on the line. Volk pleaded with him again. His decision was firm. He had an urge for action and a sense of duty, and seemed not to care how hard or risky it would be. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about enjoying it,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was about the idea that our Constitution isn\u2019t a bunch of toilet paper, like most of our generation thinks it is.\u201d He enlisted while still in school and requested a place in the infantry, the corps\u2019 toughest job.With four years signed away, Siatta began seeing less of Volk, thinking that it would be unfair to leave her waiting while he was gone to war. He departed for boot camp in San Diego on the day he graduated, in May 2008. Volk remembers feeling scared. But she had no argument left to make. \u201cHe did it for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an old soul.\u201dAt boot camp Siatta followed the familiar arc of transformation from civilian to Marine, although as weeks passed he displayed a skill that set him apart: He was an exceptional shot. The Marine Corps is built around its rifles. It expects every member to master what it considers the basic tool of modern war, via thorough training and annual requalification on shooting out to 500 yards. Siatta outshot almost everyone around him. This was not readily explicable. Siatta was raised in a household without firearms and was neither a hunter nor a weapons buff. He had never fired a rifle before.Instructors in the corps often say that recruits with no weapons experience can become accomplished shots because they have no bad habits to unlearn. Siatta offers this as the explanation for his own superior skill. But when he talks of how he shot, it is also clear that when he looked down the barrel of a rifle he was capable of extreme patience and calm. Even in firefights he could sweep away distraction and focus on the habits that make precision marksmanship possible.In late 2008, after completing boot camp and an infantry course in which he demonstrated a knack for mixed martial arts and a high pain tolerance to go with his fine motor skills, Siatta checked into his battalion at Camp Lejeune, N.C. In many ways, two of his supervisors said, he was not a model Marine. He wore his uniform sloppily, could be inattentive in garrison and did not show the enthusiasm and initiative of some of his peers. He was pegged as \u201ca field Marine,\u201d a grunt suited for battle but not for the corps\u2019 broader insistence on perfection. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d say that if Siatta did not shoot as well as he did, we wouldn\u2019t know what to do with him,\u201d said his former squad leader, Sgt. Joseph M. Perez. Siatta accepts this reputation easily and said he chafed at the spit-shine requirements of Marine Corps base life. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Your boots are dirty,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be like: \u2018Of course they are dirty. I\u2019m a fucking rifleman. I joined to do a dirty job.\u2019\u2009\u201d All agree that his skill with a rifle assured his place. As his platoon readied for combat, its commander, Second Lt. Tyler P. Kurtz, selected him for a particularly difficult role: designated marksman.The D.M., as troops call this position, was a recent adjustment to the corps\u2019 small-unit organization, a role between that of regular riflemen and snipers. It was made necessary, in the corps\u2019 view, by the arid environments of Afghanistan and Iraq, where a dearth of vegetation often meant that gunfights occurred at long ranges, and conventional units needed Marines with skills and equipment to hit targets outside the ready range of standard M4s or M16s. Rare is the Marine who does not wish to shoot better; a culture that celebrates riflery bestows credibility and respect on those who shoot best. Siatta\u2019s selection was an honor, the more so because he was otherwise untested. Kurtz, now a captain who commands a Marine infantry company, said he chose Siatta nonetheless because he exuded maturity when behind a rifle. \u201cHe was a natural,\u201d he said.Siatta\u2019s selection brought pressures he had not contemplated before. In Afghanistan he would be called on to do the shooting that would make gunfights stop. Through the lens of a telescopic sight, he would also be expected to watch over and protect his platoon, which meant eyeing civilians through cross hairs, one after another, and looking for indicators \u2014 a partly hidden weapon, the remote detonator of a bomb \u2014 that might give him a military justification to kill. This would require a constant commitment to discernment and a disciplined sense of restraint, balanced with a willingness to take others\u2019 lives, sometimes in the intimate fashion that can come with an eight-power scope. Even the nickname for the role, Guardian Angel, was freighted with a presumption of unerring perfection and righteous power.Siatta had shot only paper targets. He wondered whether he was good enough. What would happen to his friends, he asked himself, if he choked?The prewar preparations of Second Battalion, Second Marines left little time for rest. Siatta lived in Fox Company\u2019s barracks, where underage drinking was forbidden and policed by noncommissioned officers. He was too young to purchase alcohol legally or enter bars and did not show much interest in alcohol in any event. His fellow Marines recall him hanging back, unlike some of the louder personalities. \u201cHe was very quiet, very internal, one of the guys who didn\u2019t say much,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWhen he spoke, it was pretty comical, because it was like, \u2018Whoa, where did that come from?\u2019\u2009\u201dIn late October 2009, the battalion landed in Afghanistan and quickly moved into the rural badlands. In keeping with the corps\u2019 latest way of waging war, its Marines were to spend a seven-month tour characterized by an unrelenting pace of small foot patrols. At Camp Leatherneck, Fox Company was given its first mission: to set up in patrol bases near the village of Lakari, drive off the Taliban and help the Afghan government extend security and services into the area.It was an ambitious order. Helmand Province, Afghanistan\u2019s largest, had had a light Western military presence since 2001. Much of it had taken the form of British units in fortified outposts with limited influence over territory around them. After a bloody campaign in Iraq\u2019s Anbar Province, the Marine Corps shifted attention to Helmand, turning the province into the corps\u2019 own corner of Afghanistan. The villages around Lakari, nestled amid irrigated cropland along the winding Helmand River about 90 miles from Pakistan, formed a Taliban and drug-runners\u2019 stronghold. Other Marines raided Lakari in the summer, but they left, and the area remained beyond the Afghan government\u2019s reach. The local bazaar, on dusty land east of the river, was a no-go zone \u2014 full-on enemy turf.On Nov. 1, the company\u2019s First and Third Platoons arrived at Patrol Base Lakari, a crude outpost built weeks before. Little more than tents surrounded by a 13-foot-high dirt berm, it had the hastily conceived and temporary feel of much of the Marine involvement in Afghanistan. It was reached through a gate and watched over by four raised bunkers where Marines rotated turns on post, one in each bunker by day, two by night.From behind sandbags and bulletproof glass, the Marines looked upon a desolate vista and could feel menace awaiting them. Like the bazaar, about a mile to the south, the patrol base was situated just outside the irrigated cropland, at the edge of the steppe. Vegetation and a maze of dried mud walls lay to the west and southwest. The year\u2019s poppy crop had been harvested. A stubble of corn stalks dotted the landscape. The farmers between the base and the bazaar were presumed to be spotters who watched the Americans\u2019 routine and signaled their movements to the Taliban. No patrol could leave the base without being seen before it reached the fields.Whenever Marines ventured into the neighboring patchwork of farmland, canals and homes, they were entering a network of interconnected traps. Small slits had been cut in the mud walls \u2014 Marines called them \u201cmurder holes\u201d \u2014 from which the Taliban could fire. Bombs had been buried in the dirt. Ambushes were laid by fighters who typically kept a canal between themselves and their targets, preventing the Marines from employing their preferred tactic of rushing attackers. The patrol base was a target for rockets. The Marine unit that had lived in it for the past few weeks was leaving Afghanistan, ending its tour and passing to Fox Company a mission that would require small-unit gunfighting on someone else\u2019s home ground. In his journal, Siatta recorded his first impression, in standard grunt-speak: \u201cThe coffee here tastes like shit.\u201dBy 2009, the eighth year of its Afghan occupation, the United States had repeatedly reshaped its reasons and practices for fighting its post-Sept. 11 wars. Under ideas in favor at this moment, nicknamed COIN, the military\u2019s inelegant shorthand for its optimistically conceived counterinsurgency doctrine, troops were expected to follow a three-stage process to declaw and displace the Taliban: clear, hold and build. This meant sweeping through an area to weaken opposing fighting groups by force and then holding the ground and trying to secure it over time, all in the service of allowing the central government\u2019s local project to take root and grow. At the same time, Marines were told to coach Afghan forces and befriend villagers (in part by handing out cash) and urge them into roles (informants, contractors, local officials) that would make them partners in the new way. They were also supposed to encourage farmers to abandon the cultivation of opium poppy, the region\u2019s most lucrative cash crop.That was the theory and the hope, often officially expressed. In practice it meant destroying a firmly established local economy and bringing in rule by outsiders. And the first phase \u2014 \u201cclearing\u201d \u2014 was a euphemism for violence, repeatedly applied via small gunfights and supported by American artillery and air power. A corollary, often unstated but understood by those doing the patrols, was that any group of Afghans willing to face the Marines head to head would gradually be thinned, while every seven months the Americans, bloodied and made jumpy by firefights and bombs, would be replaced with fresh troops. It was small-scale attrition warfare, with hearts-and-minds jive.Siatta\u2019s turn came quickly. On Nov. 2, his second day at the patrol base, Third Platoon was gathering to meet the Marines they were replacing when two rockets roared in and exploded, one inside and another outside the perimeter. Siatta ran for his equipment \u2014 flak jacket, helmet, first-aid kit and the rest \u2014 and stood with his rifle waiting for a ground attack that never came. He was at war now, \u201cheart racin, hands shakin but had a smile on my face,\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cI dont know why I was smilin maybe it was because I could have got blown the fuck up and didn\u2019t.\u201dTo stop incoming rockets, the patrols would have to make the Taliban think twice about taking such risks. That night, Siatta was issued a Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle, the more accurate descendant of the M16, which he would carry throughout his tour, along with open-tip match-grade ammunition, a departure from the military\u2019s standard full-metal jacket rounds that sacrificed armor penetration but caused more damaging soft-tissue wounds. The rifle was equipped with a suppressor to muffle its report. Siatta was a hunter now. Clearing the fields around Lakari was his job. He was 20 years old.On a section of steppe the Marines called \u201cthe eastern desert,\u201d Siatta adjusted the rifle\u2019s scope. His practice range, an empty expanse of compacted soil and tiny tufts of dried grass, was safe. The local fighters did not leave the security of their home turf to fight in the open. Like an athlete stretching on a sideline before competition, Siatta made his last preparations. Methodically firing into rations boxes, he determined and wrote down the data for exact distances, then set the scope for 300 yards and taped the chart to his rifle\u2019s stock. He was ready.At the lower ranks of the Marine Corps, the Pentagon\u2019s airbrushed language of war can fade away. Tactical slang hews closer to battlefield fact. Marines talk of \u201cbait patrols,\u201d in which one group of grunts heads off to a contested area trying to draw fire, while others wait, hoping that once the Taliban show themselves they can attack their flanks. And they talk of the most straightforward mission of all: movement to contact, which means exactly that.On Nov. 7, Siatta\u2019s squad, accompanied by Lieutenant Kurtz and a machine-gun team, headed just over a mile south and stopped beside a house to talk with whoever approached. Siatta\u2019s journal entry that day was unequivocal about the purpose.Now let me be clear our mission was not to talk to the locales and shot the shit. Our mission was to get the Talibans atention and hopefully have them attach use and give there position away.The battalion leaving Afghanistan was opposed to the mission. Kurtz faced contradictory orders. His company commander was telling him to push south, while the operations officer in the command center was ordering him back. The Marines headed back.On the return walk, they were attacked. \u201cGunfire opens up out of a tree line,\u201d Siatta\u2019s journal reads. \u201cRounds cracking and snaping through the air and skipin across the ground.\u201dThe squad reacted as infantry units in their first firefight often do. Most of the Marines opened up with everything they had. Siatta found a position along a mud wall, fired a few shots and then stopped. Through his scope he saw nothing to shoot.Around him others cut loose. The squad\u2019s M249 automatic weapons and M240 machine gun tore through belts of ammunition. The fire-team leaders lobbed one high-explosive 40-mm grenade after another. Lance Cpl. Dustin J. Hagglund, who led the machine-gun team, described it afterward as \u201can ammo dump, basically.\u201d Two cows, he said, were cut in half. The firefight was of a familiar type: a swift and ferocious clash between combatants who scarcely glimpsed one another. Beyond signaling toughness and an eagerness to fight, it accomplished little. \u201cWe did the suppression, we closed with them and we pulled back,\u201d Lance Cpl. Jeffrey Ratliff said. The Taliban also withdrew. No one, it seemed, had been struck.The Marines strode back to their patrol base, exuberant, riding the rush of having been under fire and coming out alive. This is one of war\u2019s exhilarating drugs. It fueled backslaps and shouts. \u201cEveryone was like high-fiving and everything,\u201d Hagglund told me. \u201cWe were the first squad in the company to get in a firefight.\u201dA few minutes later Hagglund was in a bunker when a Toyota pickup rushed toward the gate. It stopped short. Its occupants hopped out and retrieved a wheelbarrow from the bed. A few Afghan soldiers ran to meet them. In the wheelbarrow was a small boy who had been shot through the skull.The bullet had struck above his left eyebrow and blown out the back of his head. But it had hit high enough that the child was still alive \u2014 unresponsive, breathing fitfully. The man pushing the wheelbarrow was his father. Siatta watched as the Marines took the child to their aid station and rested his shattered skull over a stainless-steel bowl. A corpsman tried to keep what was left of his head intact by cupping it in his hands. A sandstorm had blown up, grounding the helicopter fleet. It was a few hours before an aircraft took him away. Not long after, the radio brought word. The boy had died.Hagglund thought the child might be 4 years old. Siatta and Perez thought he might be 6. No one was exactly sure how he had been shot. Ratliff figured he was hit while running through the gunfight to save the cows. The corpsman who examined the wound said it was caused by a 5.56-millimeter bullet, which matched weapons that the Marines carried. Perez tried consoling his squad. \u201cThis is how it works,\u201d he said. \u201cRounds go everywhere in firefights, and as hard as we try to prevent civilian casualties, this is going to happen sometimes.\u201d He reminded them that they had not shot first. They were ambushed. But words, he knew, had limits. \u201cMy guys felt guilty,\u201d he said.After the first night, the Marines barely discussed the boy\u2019s death. \u201cWe just kind of did the man thing, and we did not talk about it ever again,\u201d Perez said. Hagglund described a collective reticence. \u201cNone of us talked about our feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were gung-ho. We were taking care of business.\u201d They bleached the stainless-steel bowl, ate out of it and went back out on patrols.Fox Company intended to clear the area around Lakari quickly. The next week was a blur. \u201cNothing,\u201d Siatta wrote in his journal, \u201cbut firefight, rockets, ambushes, post resuply missions and just chaos.\u201dAnd then he took his first clear shot.On Nov. 17, the platoon commander, Kurtz, accompanied the squad, reinforced with a machine-gun team and Afghan soldiers, on a mission deep into Taliban turf. He had noticed a pattern. After each gunfight, the Taliban\u2019s fighters seemed to withdraw to the same fields and buildings west of the bazaar. Kurtz was sick of it and planned to walk straight into their area, summon them to a fight and kill as many of them as he could. \u201cIt was a pure and simple movement to contact, and nothing else,\u201d he said.The squad set off in midmorning. To Kurtz\u2019s surprise, no Taliban fighters showed up. \u201cBasically we humped all day,\u201d he said. The squad continued a few miles west of the bazaar, into an area where no Marines had been before, when an ambush erupted around part of it. One team of Marines was filing across a field when the Taliban opened fire. The range was short. The ambushers were about 200 yards away. Following their training, the Marines in the kill zone turned toward the gunfire and charged. Those in the strip of vegetation between the fields alternated between shooting and rushing, trying to envelop the attackers.An Afghan soldier fired a rocket-propelled grenade near the lieutenant, and the back blast nearly deafened him. The Taliban was firing with a PK machine gun, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. The squad was spread out, with Perez and Siatta moving with a team a few hundred yards off. Perez looked behind his Marines and saw a man on a roof about 300 yards away, partly hidden by a wall. He raised his four-power scope for a closer view. The man did not seem to be holding anything but was watching the fight, perhaps directing the Taliban.Siatta was beside Perez with an eight-power scope. Under the rules, Marines were required to have \u201cPID\u201d \u2014 positive identification \u2014 of a combatant before firing. Even warning shots were forbidden without an officer\u2019s approval. Another platoon had recently shot an Afghan with a radio, only to discover that the radio was a harmless transistor for listening to the news and that the man had a mental disability. The Marines had been warned about avoiding more mistakes.Siatta kept his sight on the man. He did not see a weapon, a radio or a cellphone. But he was suspicious. Perez told him to fire a warning shot and chase the man off. \u201cI told Siatta to shoot under the guy,\u201d he told me.Siatta fired. The man collapsed. Perez lowered his M4 and looked down at Siatta. \u201cDid you just shoot that man?\u201d he asked.Siatta nodded.Perez was astonished. But they were midway through a gunfight, with Marines pinned down in a field, and he understood that Siatta could have hit the man unintentionally. He decided to wait to confront him.The squad fought south for about 600 yards, clearing several buildings. At one point they were taking fire from a compound, and as Kurtz was organizing an airstrike, he saw, through a gap in the wall, a woman inside. She was holding a baby. Kurtz thought the Taliban might have pushed her into view as a human shield. He called off the airstrike. Some of the Marines watched several unarmed men sprinting away from a building they were closing on and asked for permission to shoot them. Kurtz thought the fleeing men were combatants who had ditched their weapons. But again, he said, he followed the rules. He ordered the squad not to fire. It was a maddening fight, under an ornate system of restrictions that the Taliban knew how to exploit, a style of war that could enrage those who followed it. \u201cA lot of the guys in the squad were pissed at me that day,\u201d Kurtz said.Back at their base, Perez asked Siatta to explain his shot. \u201cWere you sighted on that guy?\u201d he said.Siatta, he said, answered, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe told me he wanted to feel what it was like to kill someone,\u201d Perez later recalled.Perez was angry and concerned. He reported the incident to Kurtz, and the company began investigating Siatta. Kurtz, too, was disturbed. He sensed trouble. Villagers had been gathering at the gate, complaining about every mistake Fox Company made. Kurtz expected they would soon arrive with a body.He warned Siatta that he stood to face charges. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how this plays out for you, bud,\u201d he told him. Kurtz took away his rifle and suspended him from patrols. Siatta was near tears. Perez supported the lieutenant\u2019s position and said he wondered about Siatta\u2019s suitability for war. \u201cThere is a difference between wanting to kill a person and killing the right person,\u201d he said. \u201cOur concern was that Siatta would fall into the trap of killing for pleasure, which he had the ability to do.\u201dYears later, the shot remains a point of contention. Siatta said he understood the reprimand but steadfastly defends his actions. \u201cThis is one of the stressors of being a designated marksman,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou have to make that call. That guy was bad news. That was a shady guy.\u201d In the same circumstance, he said, he would take the shot again. \u201cYou could save your buddies\u2019 lives,\u201d he said, \u201cat the expense of your own ass.\u201d Perez said these answers are unacceptable. \u201cHe can say the guy looked shady, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to shoot him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I let my squad shoot everyone who was shady, we could have killed an entire village.\u201dFor a few days, Third Platoon patrolled without Siatta. Everyone waited. The villagers did not appear. A patrol to the building found no sign of anyone wounded. No blood, no bandages, no one making accusations. A body never turned up. Perez returned Siatta\u2019s rifle and reinstated him.The fighting intensified, along with the frustration. On one mission, the platoon tried to capture a Taliban commander about six miles away. The man escaped. Siatta was so annoyed after listening to a \u201cbullshit speech about even though we found nothing we still came out on top\u201d from Cuomo, the company commander, that he wrote in his journal that he \u201cwanted to punch him in the face.\u201dNot yet two months into his tour, Siatta was no longer a na\u00efve kid from the prairie. He had hardened, and was both angry and more alert. He was harboring doubts about the war. Marines were doing the most dangerous work and were told that Afghan forces were going to build on their success. After watching the Afghan soldiers his platoon worked with, Siatta was certain that was not going to happen. When he visited them in their tents, he said, \u201cthey\u2019d be in there on their rugs, making chai, smoking dope. I\u2019d be like: \u2018You guys are fucking turds. We\u2019re here to do shit, and you\u2019re high as fuck.\u2019\u2009\u201d When Marines patrolled, many of the Afghans stayed back.Always there was another patrol.On Nov. 22, the Marines in another platoon were attacked, and when Third Platoon went to help they were ambushed, too \u2014 trapped by gunfire from multiple directions. Attack helicopters came to their aid, forcing back the Taliban.Once the ambush was broken, First Squad was ordered to sweep a compound from which the Taliban had been firing. A building inside had been hit with two Hellfire missiles. The squad crossed a cold, waist-deep canal and stacked at the entrance. Siatta was on point. They threw a fragmentation grenade over the compound wall, then followed it inside. As Siatta pushed through the gate, he saw the remains of an Afghan. His guts were exposed through disheveled clothes. He was maybe 14.his stomach had been blown open and his intestense had spilled out onto the ground and his body had been peppered with pieces of the rocket. It was a fucked up thing to see. but I continued to clear into the first room on the left of the building and the first thing I see is an old man who was pretty much blown in half and his legs were hanging on by just tishues of skin. he was still alive if you want to call it that but he was still consious. it sounded like he was choking on his blood, he died minutes later, and the rest of the family who lived there were cut up by frag and debre. Siatta watched the family file out \u2014 bereaved, terrified and covered in fine, powdery dust. They were powerless, unable to communicate with the Americans who stood in their home.The Marines were grieving, too. Lance Cpl. Nicholas Hand, from First Platoon, had been shot through the head and killed, perhaps by gunfire from that house. Another Marine had been hit in the leg. Kurtz said the platoon already sensed that the plans for Helmand were destined to fail. \u201cIt was obvious even then that this wasn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone understood that this was just going back to the Taliban again as soon as we leave.\u201d He could see that some of his Marines were having difficulty processing it all. The misdirected carnage, the feeling that their sacrifices and risks were connected to a campaign that could not succeed \u2014 all of it, Kurtz said, preyed on their minds.Siatta kept his feelings inside but described the episode bluntly in his journal: \u201cBoy did we fuck that up.\u201dSoon after, on Thanksgiving, his writing captured the funk into which he was descending.Today is just another day without my family holiday. Just dont mean anything. and really ever since my Dad past away holidays slowly every year lost their meaning. Im sitting here behind a 240 Bravo medium machine gun and Im supost to feel the holiday spirit, I think not. It hurts to think about how holidays used to be and that they used to mean something when I was a kid. but Im reminded every day out here that Im not a kid and yesterdays not today and never will be.They reached the broken building. Siatta pressed himself chest down behind a mound of dirt, extended the bipods on his rifle, looked over the top and fired about 10 shots, roughly toward where the gunfire was coming from. Then he did what he had been trained to do. He slowed his breathing. He focused. As the bullets cracked by, he put his eye to the glass and considered his options. He wondered: Where would he be if he were them?There was a building across the field. Siatta had a good feeling about it. He had settled in now, as if he were part of the earth. He pointed the scope toward the building\u2019s left side and placed the cross hairs at the corner. He breathed slowly. He waited.A man stepped into the cross hairs. He was young, maybe in his 20s, wearing a white top and a dark vest. He held a Kalashnikov rifle. Siatta wasn\u2019t sure of the range, but thought it might be 250 yards. His scope was set for 300. Expecting his bullet to strike slightly high, he rested the cross hairs below the man\u2019s chest, slowly exhaled and eased the trigger back until he felt the rifle\u2019s light kick.The bullet struck the man near his genitals. Siatta watched him drop. It happened as Perez called a cease-fire.\u201cI just shot someone,\u201d Siatta said.\u201cIs he dead?\u201d the sergeant asked.Siatta looked through the scope. The man writhed in the confused agony Marines call \u201cthe kicking chicken.\u201d Siatta figured the open-tip bullet had torn out his buttocks. He fired a few more times. The man went still.\u201cHe is now,\u201d Siatta said.A second young man stepped out. Now Siatta knew the distance. The puzzle was solved. His first shot looked as if it hit squarely in his chest. The man collapsed.Siatta felt relaxed. He kept his scope trained on the corner. A third man stepped out, reaching for one of the downed men. Siatta fired. The man spun and stumbled away. Siatta thought he had hit his arm.Perez watched through his four-power scope. \u201cIt was almost like a video game \u2014 I know that sounds ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one guy stepped into the open, and Siatta shot him, and he dropped violently, and then another guy stepped into the open, and Siatta shot, and that guy went down violently, and then a third guy came out, and Siatta hit him too.\u201d Siatta, he said, \u201cwas basically the main effort of the entire squad.\u201dAs the squad waited for Siatta to take another shot, the corner exploded in fire and dust. Other Marines had seen the Taliban fighters, too, through the sight on a TOW missile system. Kurtz had cleared them to shoot, ending the fight.Siatta now had undisputed combat kills. At first it felt good. His doubts had been erased. \u201cI\u2019d wondered: Can I deliver? Am I just a target shooter? Will I let my guys down?\u201d The cloud over the previous shot, for which he had risked a criminal charge, was evaporating.His satisfaction was temporary. War plays on the mind. Marksmanship can seem simple one moment and complicated the next. Siatta\u2019s doubts nagged him anew. He wondered if the kills were luck. \u201cWas it a fluke?\u201d he asked himself. \u201cWas I a good-enough shot?\u201d Other thoughts plumbed darker depths. Siatta had been curious about what it felt like to kill. His journal shows his unease upon finding out.It was a great day and one of the worst days Iv had so far. Today I thought my family was going to get a folded flag and bullshit letter saying wat a great Marine I am and shit like that but I made it.I hope my family recognizes me when I get back. and I hope they understand I\u2019ve changed but only through the acts of self preservation. My mind cannot be healed from the horrors of war. I hope they understand.In the next two weeks, Siatta shot at least six and perhaps as many as 10 more people, according to his diary and Marines present.On a Dec. 10 patrol that would become the most significant mission of Fox Company\u2019s tour, the platoon departed on a raid to capture a Taliban commander whom Special Operations forces were trying to arrest. The weather had turned bad, no aircraft were flying and the commander was reported to be in a compound west of the bazaar.The Marines seized the compound but did not find him. They settled inside, listening with an interpreter to intercepted Taliban radio chatter. Their foes were saying they had found the Americans\u2019 boot prints in the fields but were not sure where they had gone. Soon the Taliban figured it out. The platoon came under attack from three sides.Kurtz was organizing the fight when he received an unexpected order. The Taliban boss was now said to be in a building in the bazaar. Third Platoon was to go there and catch him. Until then, the bazaar was considered so dangerous that the Marines were told not to approach it. The platoon had assumed that when the time came to clear it, the entire company would be involved in a large planned operation. Now the platoon \u2014 about 40 Marines, already under fire \u2014 was to rush there immediately. Kurtz dryly calls the mission \u201cOperation Santa Claus \u2014 because you had to be 8 years old to believe it.\u201dIt was during this confusion, he said, that Siatta solidified the respect of his peers. He had climbed onto a shed roof with another Marine and was watching over the platoon\u2019s movements when the Taliban started shooting again. The roof was flimsy, made of thin branches. The two Marines were exposed, with only a sack of grain and an empty 55-gallon drum to hide behind.Kurtz, overwhelmed and unsure about how best to organize the platoon\u2019s movement with the Taliban seeming to swarm around them, watched from below as Siatta scanned the farmland. He heard the distinct sound of a suppressed Mark 12, something between a metallic click and the snap of a whip. Siatta had seen two men, he said, and with a few shots killed them both. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said, and slipped to the ground. The platoon crossed the field.The fighting grew into a rolling battle, with lulls followed by fresh clashes. Another platoon joined in. During one skirmish, Siatta said, he hit a Taliban fighter carrying a machine gun as he hustled across a bridge. It was a long, difficult shot. He judged the distance before killing the man by watching the arc of machine-gun tracers as another Marine fired bursts that missed.Later, Siatta was with another squad as it hurried across yet another dangerous area. The Marines took fire from behind. Most of them ran for a canal and slid down its bank, but Siatta remained in the open. Kurtz watched as he took a knee, assuming a position Marines practice on rifle ranges. Alone, under fire, with neither cover nor concealment, Siatta was visibly relaxed. Through his scope he spotted a fighter with a rifle about 250 yards away, lurking in a shadow by a wall. Siatta fired twice.The first round missed, striking the wall to the man\u2019s left. Siatta moved the cross hairs right. The second shot hit. \u201cHe\u2019s down, sir,\u201d Siatta said to an incredulous Kurtz as he rejoined the squad. Kurtz describes the moment with something like awe. \u201cThe small-arms fire we were taking just ended,\u201d he said, \u201cand never started up again.\u201dAfter the operation the Marines held the bazaar. The pace of fighting subsided. Kurtz finished Operation Santa Claus with an indelible sense of debt to Siatta, who he said kept the platoon safe during the worst of its tour. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for Sammy,\u201d he told me. \u201cAll of us owe him a lot. He killed people who would have killed other people, including some of us.\u201d He also said that Siatta\u2019s controversial shot early in the fighting, at the man on the roof, may have been the right call. \u201cHe probably had a good gut instinct, in retrospect.\u201dNo matter these feelings, Kurtz speaks of his former D.M. with sadness. Siatta\u2019s transformation, he said, was welcomed on the battlefield but is painful to think about now. \u201cWatching Sam evolve from that sweet, innocent kid to that killer he became, the killer we needed him to be,\u201d he said, \u201cit breaks my heart.\u201dSiatta, as he fought, had narrowed his thoughts to basic impulses and simple goals. \u201cYou are not fighting for America,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not fighting for the Marine Corps. You are just a bunch of 19-year-olds trying to make it to chow.\u201d His journal entry after the fight for the bazaar described the self-loathing of a warrior disgusted by his own success.The Marines in my platoon talk up to me like Im sumthin special they say Iv got a gift but this is one gift Id gladly return. These guys talk about killin as if it were a sport. Killin is just the art of survival.A few days later he wrote of guilt.I go to sleep every night knowing I have the blood of so many on my hands and no amount of soap could ever wash these stains away.On Christmas, as Fox Company waited for a visit from a general, Siatta was smoking as much as an entire pack of cigarettes on a six-hour post, and contemplating suicide.Fuck the General he doesn\u2019t know a dam thing about wat weve done here. The only thing he knows about what weve done here is the reports he reads from our Lt. He doesn\u2019t know anything about combat or to lose a good friend.I tried calling my Mom for Christmas, I got through but the phone disconnected. Fuck it I\u2019m used to getting fucked down here so I wasn\u2019t to disappointed.I\u2019m on post rit now and Iv been on post since 4 am It\u2019s 10 am Iv been looking at my Rifle and was wondering. Wat dos hot brass taste like. I mean really, racking a round around in the chamber, sticking the muzzle in your mouth and blowing the fillings out the back of your dom. It kind of made me curious, but neither here nor there. I guess wat Im trying to say is Im having a marry fucking Christmas and joy to the world peace towards man and all that bullshit.In late December, while pinned down beside a canal, Siatta was almost killed by a burst from a Taliban machine gun. A bullet struck the ground near his head. His face was cut by fragments and bits of stone. His ballistic goggles were gouged.Perez ran to him and found him with blood streaming down his face. Siatta appeared stunned and then panicked. Perez assured him the wounds were not serious and tried to get Siatta to shoot a pair of fleeing Taliban fighters. The distance was long. It was the only time Perez saw Siatta have difficulty making shots. He fired, and fired again. He kept missing.The squad captured a wounded Taliban fighter, shot through the knee. When a medevac helicopter came, Perez opted to evacuate the prisoner and not Siatta. He regrets the choice, because it denied Siatta the medical documentation necessary for a Purple Heart. A corpsman cleaned and bandaged Siatta\u2019s face, and they hiked back to their outpost. Perez said he tried to submit Siatta for a Purple Heart, but the company blocked it, saying the wounds were not serious enough. \u201cI was upset about that, because if he didn\u2019t have his goggles, he would have lost an eye,\u201d Perez told me. \u201cI felt personally responsible for it. I didn\u2019t medevac him. I felt personally responsible for denying him what he deserved.\u201dAfter that fight, the pace of combat further slowed. Just shy of 100 days in Afghanistan, Siatta had time to reflect.Sitting on post and not in firefights is really starting to fuck with me. Its making me rethink all the disitions Ive made here and making me question if they were the right ones to begin with. The men I\u2019ve killed well 15-year-old boys with Guns is more like it but did I deserve to kill them did they deserve to die.I mean I\u2019m 20 years old I know damn well the risks of joinin the Marine Corps in time of war But did these young boys, Boys that I\u2019ve killed know what the fuck they were doin or even fighting for, these are the questions I ask myself.In spring 2010, before the battalion completed its tour, Kurtz recommended Siatta for a medal recognizing his valor. Lakari was calm, and Siatta would be going home. He seemed to have been spared. His diary hinted at looming troubles.The last person to get hit by an IED was Cpl Nicely and he lost Both his legs and Both his arms. Iv seen and done a lot of Bad things some good but I\u2019m supost to just forget thoughs things and just start back up write where I left off when I get back home. How can I do that? No response.Maureen booked a room near the base and spent a weekend trying to reconnect with her son. Siatta did not sleep at night and did not leave his bed most of the day. He spoke very little. Maureen watched him, saddened and concerned. She settled on an accommodating explanation, telling herself he was exhausted and jet-lagged, still living on the Afghan time zone.Several days later, in May, the Marine Corps granted Siatta post-deployment leave, which he spent at his mother\u2019s home. President Obama was visiting Illinois for Memorial Day, and Siatta was invited to a presidential ceremony at a cemetery in Elwood. It was a short drive, and he would have been the perfect prop: the infantry Marine freshly returned from Obama\u2019s surge. He refused to attend. At his trial, when asked why he declined, he dismissed any interest in public ritual. \u201cMaybe because my experiences in Afghanistan didn\u2019t feel so great for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think a parade was the most fitting thing.\u201dMaureen noticed that he still kept night hours. She lived in a two-bedroom apartment and worked days at a pharmacy. At night she watched him brood. Siatta had never been a drinker and was allergic to beer. Now he was drinking heavily and for hours on end. Many nights he left for bars. She asked him how, at 20, he was able to buy alcohol. He told her that when he showed military identification, he had no trouble. When he came home, he was awake almost until morning, pacing, getting drunker on liquor he poured himself. She sat in the living room, asking him to relax.\u201cNo,\u201d he\u2019d say.\u201cWant something to eat?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWant to go to the store?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSeveral times that week he blacked out. Maureen was unsure what to think or do. He told her nothing of Afghanistan, of the killing he had seen and done. She did not intervene. \u201cI just thought maybe he had to clear his head,\u201d she said. \u201cI figured: \u2018Let him go. He\u2019s got to clear his head.\u2019\u2009\u201dReturning to Camp Lejeune after his leave, Siatta fell into a similar pattern. The corps considered him tested now. He received his medal. The battalion\u2019s Scout Sniper Platoon recruited him, and he left Fox Company to join them. He loaded up on tattoos, including a sword-wielding Lady Justice on his chest and abdomen, topped with seven hash marks for men he claimed as kills. The Marines he deployed with were coming of age. There had been little opportunity to spend money in Afghanistan, and many returned with savings. Some bought cars. They were turning 21 and could legally visit bars. On weekends, groups of them would take trips, sometimes to the beach. Siatta rarely went along. \u201cHe kind of went into a shell,\u201d Ratliff said. \u201cI\u2019d invite him out, and he was like, \u2018No, I just want to stay in my room.\u2019\u2009\u201dSiatta wrote to Ashley Volk. She was a college student and aerial dancer now, with an apartment in Chicago\u2019s West Humboldt Park neighborhood. He flew to meet her. Their first night together was surreal. Siatta was quieter than usual and emanated discipline and self-control. Volk had always been outgoing and talkative; they had joked for years that she was his opposite. Looking at him after their long separation, she sensed that something troubled him. She tried drawing him out.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked him. \u201cTell me. What are you thinking?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, pretty gypsy,\u201d he said.That night they made love. \u201cI felt our old connection,\u201d she said. Immediately after, Siatta withdrew. As she lay beside him, he reached for a blanket and wrapped it tightly around his body, with all his limbs tucked inside. He was like a Marine sleeping on hard ground, plank straight, self-contained, cocooned, alone. She passed the night uneasily. \u201cNo contact, no cuddling, no pillows,\u201d Volk said. \u201cHe was there. But he was gone.\u201dThe next night he did the same thing.The battalion joined the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, and in spring 2011, as Libya sank into civil war, the Marines were ordered aboard amphibious ships headed for the Libyan coast. On his last visit to Chicago, Siatta gave Volk his Afghan diary. He had thought of destroying it but decided to entrust it to her. She read the first page and stopped. They had a day and a half together before he shipped out, and she was emotionally stretched as it was. \u201cI was hugging him, telling him I was going to kidnap him,\u201d she said.After he was gone, she started reading again. When she came to his account of the child shot through the head in Siatta\u2019s first firefight, she felt panicked and stopped. For weeks she read his chronicle, section by section, again and again. No matter the kill-or-be-killed mentality Siatta had been reduced to, she could see him there, the grieving boy she had known since sixth grade.Day 34 LakariThis entry has nothing to do with wat im doin here in afghanistan but it\u2019s just been on my mind. I call this entry coffee and memories.When I was a small boy nothin more than 4 \u2026 I would wake up around 5 or so in the morning to watch my dad get ready for work. He would shave, brush his teeth and you no the usual. But when he was done with that he could get the Newspaper and drink his coffee. He would let me sip on his coffee and it would just be me and him. Now I didn\u2019t really know my father to well because he died when I was so young but thoughs memories I have of him drinking coffee is wat keeps him alive in my mind.Now what made me think of thoughs memories of my dad Drinking coffee was here in afghanistan we stand a lot of posts and a lot of partrols, so usually were very tired and we drink a lot of coffee. Ever cup I drink I think of my dad so Ive been thinkin of him quit abit. and if I ever have kids, when Im getin ready for work I want them to sip on my coffee.Volk wrote letters to him and mailed them to his ship, the U.S.S. Bataan. At first Siatta replied. But life as a Marine on the ship, with its claustrophobic berthing areas and dull routine, was mind-numbing. As sea time dragged on, he closed himself off. He stopped answering her letters.The war in Libya did not require him to go ashore. The ships made port visits in Europe, where Siatta and his friends were given time off, much of which was spent binge-drinking. \u201cWhenever we had free time, we all got lit up,\u201d he told me. In February 2012, the battalion returned to Camp Lejeune. His time in the corps was soon up. He left the service unceremoniously and drove home to Illinois in a used Chevy he bought with his combat pay. He did not tell Volk he was back. She began dating another man.Siatta sought an even quieter life than before. His family noticed his anger, his social withdrawal and what they now acknowledge as his alcoholism. He seethed at his mother for putting a welcome-home message on a sign at a local McDonald\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody looking at me,\u201d he told her. He seemed intent on near anonymity and on avoiding discussion of the war. \u201cHe wanted no one to know that he had been there,\u201d she testified at his trial. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want anyone saying, \u2018Thank you for your service.\u2019 He wanted nothing. He wanted to be left alone.\u201dSiatta spent more than a year living in his mother\u2019s home. He did not contact Volk and assumed she had moved on. For months, he was listless. \u201cHow did you spend your time?\u201d one of his lawyers asked at trial. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Siatta replied. \u201cI would say I probably sat in my room, nothing.\u201d Inside his bedroom, his mother said, he drank and played video games. She would rest on a couch near his door, listening through the night. \u201cI used to hear him hitting the wall,\u201d she said.As a teenager Siatta had cut the lawn of Larry Stonitsch, a former Marine who owned Rovanco Piping Systems, a manufacturer of insulated pipe in Joliet. Now Stonitsch offered him a job at the factory. Siatta was reliable and quiet and did not talk about his combat service. Stonitsch understood. \u201cI had a stepdad who was in the Battle of the Bulge and never was right after that, after the things he saw and did,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe drank too much. So I have some empathy for that.\u201dOutside Rovanco, Siatta was barely functioning. He shrank his social world ever smaller, to the point of skipping family gatherings. In 2013, convinced her son had stagnated, Maureen suggested he consider college. He was eligible for G.I. Bill benefits, she told him, and should take them. \u201cHere is where my guilt comes in, because I am the one who talked him into going to school,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cI kind of wonder, if he had stayed here, if we would have figured out that he needed services, and he would have gotten treatment.\u201dSiatta enrolled in Joliet Junior College that summer and transferred to Illinois State in the fall. He had no academic focus, no plan beyond enrolling in the minimum number of credits to receive the G.I. Bill\u2019s monthly housing allowance. School brought him neither sanctuary nor inspiration. Classroom environments made him anxious; the bustle of students kept him vigilant. He could not relate to most classmates, who had little sense of where he had been. Often he spent weekends at his mother\u2019s house.By spring he was on a trajectory to fail. He stopped doing homework, then stopped attending most classes. Many days he stayed in the room rented with his housing allowance, in bed. He slept until afternoon and did not eat until almost evening. When he did socialize, he would drink first, heavily, to dull his anxiety. Two years out of the Marine Corps, Siatta was doing little more than staying alive.Siatta had been at the party a few minutes, hanging out on the front porch, when he thought he heard another guest say something rude to his host. Without warning, or even speaking, Siatta sucker-punched him in the face and knocked him to the floor. The man, a coach at a CrossFit, was not seriously hurt. But the hosts and guests were startled, and Siatta was asked to leave. Kramer walked him home, where he encouraged him to apologize and asked if he was suffering from PTSD. The two men returned to the party, only to be told again to leave. This time the woman who invited Siatta escorted him back to his house, leaving him outside his door.Siatta tried to call or text the woman. From there, he said, his memories stop. What he did next, step by step, is not clear. But at some point he set out into the neighborhood. Shortly after 2 a.m. he smashed through the back door of 706 Samantha Street, where the female teaching students lived. It was perhaps 100 feet away from the party.At first the former Marine inside did not see Siatta. He grabbed two knives from the kitchen, dashed back to the bedroom, handed the smaller blade to his girlfriend and told her to lock her door and call the police. He returned to the living room and stood, back to the wall, knife in hand, facing the rear of the house.For a minute or so, nothing happened. The man later told the police that Siatta might have descended to the basement, which was accessible through a door in the dining area. If that is what happened, it might have meant that Siatta thought he had entered his own home and was looking for his bed. If he did go downstairs, he did not stay long.He stepped into the other man\u2019s line of sight.The fight was swift \u2014 \u201cit went by like a flash,\u201d the other man said. Siatta struck him on the head with the pan, and he countered with the knife, stabbing Siatta in the shoulder or chest and then grabbing him in a bear hug. The two men grappled to the floor. Siatta lost his hold on the pan, the man said, and grabbed him by the throat. The man rolled onto Siatta, trying to force him to release his grip. He stabbed downward several times. Siatta let go.\u201cI quit, I quit,\u201d he said.Another man in the home, who was dating another woman who lived there, emerged from the back bedroom and helped hold Siatta down.The first police officer to arrive, Sgt. Robert Cherry, pulled up in a patrol car. He saw two women waving frantically at a window. They were mouthing words through the glass: \u201cHe\u2019s inside! There is somebody inside the house!\u201dCherry called for backup, drew his pistol and stepped through the back door. He saw two men atop a third. He asked them to back away and looked down at Siatta, who was gasping, bleeding from a stab wound to his neck. His plaid flannel shirt was soaked in blood. The sergeant put on latex gloves, knelt and asked his name.\u201cSam,\u201d Siatta answered.Cherry smelled alcohol.\u201cI am going to die,\u201d Siatta said.\u201cYou are not going to die,\u201d Cherry said.Siatta\u2019s eyes rolled in his head. \u201cIf I die, you are going to be my heroes,\u201d he said.He had nine wounds \u2014 four in the neck, two in the left biceps and one each to the left cheek, right shoulder blade and back of his head. Blood pooled on the floor and splattered the walls. At the hospital, his disorientation was total. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d he asked.A Life Flight helicopter rushed him to Peoria. The knife that had plunged into his neck missed his carotid artery and jugular vein. A surgical team repaired damage to smaller blood vessels and left behind thin platinum coils from a catheter procedure under his chin.Siatta woke the next day. His first thought was that he had been mugged or struck by a car. Two detectives entered his room, turned on a digital audio recorder and read him his rights. Siatta was on pain medication. He asked them to leave.The news took time to reach Siatta. That same month, he had entered a residential substance-abuse rehabilitation program at a V.A. hospital west of Chicago, where combat-based PTSD, depressive disorder and alcohol-use disorder were diagnosed. The V.A. prescribed him Xanax and hydroxyzine for anxiety and approved roughly $1,300 a month in disability benefits for service-connected depression and PTSD. Six weeks later, Siatta transferred to a federal health care center in North Chicago for more inpatient counseling.When Siatta checked out of the hospital in July, he turned himself in for booking. The evidence against him was strong. His mother retained a private criminal defense lawyer, Hal Jennings, who approached prosecutors about a plea to a lesser felony and a sentence of probation. Siatta had no previous criminal record. The man he had fought had not been seriously hurt. Given Siatta\u2019s combat service and apparent post-combat illness, Jennings considered it a reasonable request. But Kristin Alferink, the assistant state\u2019s attorney handling Siatta\u2019s prosecution, was firm. In September, she offered a plea to the original charge and a 10-year prison term. Jennings rejected it. \u201cI was not under any circumstances going to plead that kid into prison,\u201d he said.The state\u2019s inflexibility in part reflected the wishes of the man who had fought Siatta. Since the struggle in the kitchen, he had suffered from insomnia and was having difficulties in crowds or when people approached him from behind. \u201cI\u2019m completely paranoid of everything,\u201d he told me. He tried to make his house feel safer, he said, by having it \u201cwired to the gills with security cameras.\u201d He slept with a loaded Walther P38 pistol by his bed. He still found it difficult to relax. \u201cThe heater goes off,\u201d he said, \u201cand I jump back five feet.\u201d It was as if some of Siatta\u2019s PTSD symptoms had been transferred to him. He entered therapy and started taking anti-anxiety medication. But he remained angry. He knew little of Siatta\u2019s service in the Marine Corps. It might not have changed his feelings if he did. \u201cHe could have been Jesus incarnate,\u201d he said, \u201cand I still would have wanted blood.\u201dJennings and a partner, Carey J. Luckman, prepared for trial. They gathered military records and character recommendations from Siatta\u2019s supervisors in the Marines. They also arranged for him to undergo a second psychological evaluation. In May 2015, he was reviewed by Don R. Catherall, a psychologist specializing in trauma disorders and a Marine veteran of Vietnam. Catherall\u2019s report echoed the V.A.\u2019s diagnoses of PTSD and severe alcohol-use disorder, and noted that Siatta had not had a drink in more than a year. This, he wrote, \u201cofficially constitutes remission of the substance-use disorder.\u201d He added, \u201cAs long as he remains sober, he is unlikely to repeat the behaviors that led to this unfortunate situation.\u201dThat summer, not long after Siatta\u2019s evaluation, Ashley Volk called him. She was angry about how he had cut her off, wounded by his silence. He said he had been hurt and was getting it taken care of. She was worried, but he assured her it was not serious. In July, she asked him to meet for burgers at the Lockdown Bar & Grill, a prison-themed bar in Chicago. Upon seeing him, she said, she immediately fell back in love. After three hours of talking, they kissed.They spent the night together in her apartment. She saw the new scars on his neck, shoulder and arm and assumed something else had happened to him in the Marines. They became a couple again. Siatta was still closed off to most people, but he began to tell her about Afghanistan. Maybe, she thought, he was finally opening up. He did not tell her anything of the home invasion, or that he was awaiting trial.Alferink pushed hard, inquiring why Perrin had been \u201cemotional\u201d and asking whether she had the \u201csame empathy and thankfulness\u201d for the man Siatta had fought, who was also a veteran. During a half-hour of often-testy exchanges, Alferink proposed that Siatta\u2019s PTSD was not related to his combat service and suggested that his use of alcohol was \u201csimilar to somebody who just broke up with their boyfriend\u201d or \u201cwho couldn\u2019t cope with losing a job.\u201dJennings still thought he had a strong defense. The character references from Marines were glowing, and he was ready to argue that the fight in the kitchen was a conditioned reflex for a troubled man with Siatta\u2019s combat record.A few weeks before the trial, Jennings was discussing the case with Siatta\u2019s mother, Maureen, when she mentioned that her son had kept a journal in Afghanistan. Siatta had recently retrieved it from Volk. Jennings asked to see it. It was a small tan notebook on which Siatta had drawn a human skull with a cracked forehead. When Jennings started reading, he could not stop. On Oct. 22, 2015, less than three weeks before the trial, he entered a copy of the journal into the court record. \u201cThis is the key,\u201d he told Maureen. \u201cThis is what could win your case.\u201dBy then Siatta had graduated from a substance-abuse program and been sober for a year and half. He was in counseling. He suffered from anxiety, but less acutely, allowing him to stop taking Xanax and hydroxyzine. He was exercising, taking up martial arts and weight lifting again. It helped his moods. His relationship with Volk softened his antisocial side. Jennings asked Alferink to read the diary and consider Siatta\u2019s last night of drinking and the home invasion in light of his combat service and PTSD, and his apparent progress since. He hoped the state would consider a better plea deal. \u201cIf Sam didn\u2019t have the best mitigation package in the world, who did?\u201d he said.Alferink, in keeping with the wishes of the man who had fought Siatta, declined to change the offer. Ten years in prison, or trial.At each opportunity for sympathy, the state moved against. In jury selection, Alferink asked whether any of the potential jurors had military experience. Two said they did \u2014 a former Navy petty officer and a Marine reservist who had been injured in an accident in Afghanistan. Alferink had them excused from serving on the jury. This denied Siatta, in Jennings\u2019s view, a trial by peers. \u201cShe excluded the only people who had any chance of understanding this defendant and what he went through,\u201d he said.Siatta\u2019s lawyers did not dispute the central facts of the case. But Catherall, the psychologist, offered a profile of Siatta as a Marine utterly unmoored by war. \u201cSeeing these children die as the result of what he went over there to try and do in a positive way was kind of shattering for him,\u201d he told the jury.Alferink countered by asking how much Catherall was being paid as a defense witness \u2014 he said his rate was $300 an hour \u2014 and sketched him as a shill.The trial was over in two days. The jury found Siatta guilty within hours.The day before sentencing, she saw him off from her home.\u201cYou promise, you promise, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night?\u201d she said.\u201cI promise,\u201d he said.Siatta knew his options had run down. He returned to court and apologized in a statement leaden with resignation. \u201cI have no memory of that night,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain what happened that night. I wish I could. You know, I\u2019m getting treatment for my illness. I think I\u2019m doing better, but I\u2019ve got a long road ahead of me, and that\u2019s all I got.\u201dThe case of the People of the State of Illinois v. Samuel Siatta then took a rare turn. The trial judge, Scott Drazewski, expressed gratitude to the man he was sending away. \u201cMr. Siatta, as an American citizen, I thank you for your service to your country,\u201d he said. \u201cYour patriotism, your valor, your courage and your heroism \u2014 according to those you\u2019ve served with, you were an exceptional soldier who led by example.\u201dBut Drazewski added that he was hearing the case as a judge, not just a citizen, and because of mandatory-sentencing guidelines he had no option of assigning Siatta to probation. \u201cAlthough it is with regret,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m still required to follow the law.\u201d He sentenced Siatta to six years in prison, the legal minimum \u2014 four years less than the prosecutors had offered in their plea deal.During 28 days there, he said, he rarely left his cell. Meals were delivered to the door and eaten inside. Every Tuesday he was allowed out for a shower, in a stall where the water was scalding hot. His cell did not have a window, and the lights were never off. Between the noise and the incessant brightness, he slept fitfully. As he lost his sense of time, he was not sure when he was supposed to rest. He remembers seeing a clock once, during a group orientation. It said 9 a.m. By his estimate, he had eaten breakfast seven hours before. His anxiety rose again, and when he asked for medications, none were provided, he said, though he had a diagnosis and prescriptions from the V.A.A schedule took shape. He would lie on his bunk until breakfast, then eat and get back on the bunk until lunch. After lunch he would do squats and push-ups, then return to the bunk until dinner. Each day he received a carton of milk. A previous inmate had accumulated enough cartons to make a crude deck of playing cards, which he had left in the cell for others. Siatta did not use them. He felt himself sliding into a mental hibernation. He managed to send Volk a short letter.\u201cI love you so very much my love,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou are my one and only, and I promise. I love you so so so much and we will have a life filled with love and happiness. To my pretty gypsy, from your love, Samuel.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what else to say. The legal system bewildered him, and he found it hard to think in concrete terms, beyond that he had to leave.Outside the prison, his new lawyer, Richard Winter, was preparing an appeal. Winter had agreed to represent Siatta in late 2015, between the conviction and the sentencing. A partner at Holland & Knight, an international firm, he specialized in commercial and antitrust litigation from his 30th-floor office in downtown Chicago. He had no experience in criminal law and had taken Siatta as a client via a peculiar impulse. Holland & Knight offers pro bono representation to clients who cannot otherwise afford it. Over the years, Winter had helped autistic children in court fights against school districts in and around Chicago and had worked on Hague Convention cases, trying to reunite children with parents in international custody disputes. In November 2015, he had just read \u201cRogue Lawyer,\u201d a novel by John Grisham about Sebastian Rudd, a bourbon-drinking, gun-carrying lawyer with a bulletproof van who fights for justice for unappealing clients. Winter was amused by Rudd, a cartoonish figure. He was also impressed by his legal tactics, which he thought were able. Soon after finishing the book, Winter received an officewide email describing Siatta\u2019s case and asking if anyone wanted to step in. He figured this was a case for someone of Rudd\u2019s talents, and it looked interesting on the merits. He volunteered to try.Two weeks later, he met Siatta and his mother at a rest stop on Interstate 294. Siatta impressed him. He was in his last weeks of freedom before an expected prison term and was on his way home from PTSD counseling. Winter read the case file, looking for a basis for appeal. He attended the sentencing hearing in January and watched his new client depart for prison. The judge allowed Siatta about a minute with his mother, and after he was gone Maureen lingered in the courtroom, then in the hallway. She looked numb. Winter told her, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201dWinter knew the appeal would consume much of 2016. He also figured that while he might persuade the appellate court to consider a retrial, allowing a judge to instruct jurors to consider an involuntary-intoxication defense, the chances were probably slim. And even if the judges granted a new trial, he knew, Siatta would still need to prevail before a jury, of which there was no guarantee. Winter\u2019s backup plan was to seek a pardon from the Illinois governor after the appeals process was exhausted. Either way, Siatta was not coming home anytime soon.By March, the state had moved Siatta from Stateville to Shawnee, where inmates lived in two-story X-shaped buildings, called houses, each with a central station from which guards watched over the population. Siatta was assigned to a cell in 4-House. It was a drab and musty place with missing floor tiles, an upper and lower bunk, a toilet and a small steel sink. His cellmate, a moody man with a thin mustache, was doing time for failing to register as a sex offender.Early each morning, the locks would click open. Inmates could step into the cellblock corridor and file into the darkness and cold for a short walk to the cafeteria for breakfast and a cup of water. The routine was repeated for lunch and dinner. The schedule also allowed for about an hour of \u201cday room\u201d time \u2014 to lift weights in the open-air yard, use telephones in a call center or buy food and toiletries in the commissary with money their families added to their prison accounts.Buying extra food drew attention. In the cash-free ecosystem of prison, purchases became currency. A T-shirt, a coffee cup, a package of cookies \u2014 these could be traded or gambled. They also attracted thieves.The guards tended to cluster in the central section of each house, and they ventured only occasionally into the cellblock corridors. This meant that when the locks were released, there was a moment in which inmates could furtively enter one another\u2019s cells. Siatta returned from one meal to find about $50 worth of food stolen. His cellmate was enraged at the breach of turf. He told other inmates that he would find the thief and punish him.Siatta had probably seen more violence in his life than anyone else in 4-House. But he understood that fighting as an inmate carried special risks, and not of injury. If the guards discovered a fight, everyone involved could be taken to solitary confinement \u2014 called \u201cseg\u201d for \u201csegregation\u201d \u2014 and have their prison records marked up. This could prevent an early release. Siatta\u2019s case was on appeal. He could not afford trouble. He tried talking his cellmate down. \u201cI got a lot of stuff going on,\u201d he told him. \u201cI got a good case. I can\u2019t be getting into fights, going to seg, getting new charges over some tuna packet.\u201dOne day during day-room time, a few gang members appeared in the corridor near their door. Siatta\u2019s cellmate had heard who the thief was and had been giving him angry looks. The man wanted to know why. \u201cI\u2019m coming to the conclusion you stole our stuff,\u201d the cellmate said.Siatta did not want to be involved. He slipped out of the cell, and the gang member stepped in, while his friends stood casually in the hallway.The fight lasted maybe 15 seconds. One gang member watching from the corridor looked into the cell and pronounced the fight over, and the group broke up and drifted away.Siatta\u2019s cellmate was left on the floor. He had been beaten badly. He had a gash in his head, which had been slammed against the steel bunk. He was bleeding all over the tiles. Siatta examined the wound and knew it needed medical attention. But the man refused to approach the guards. He told Siatta he would stay in the cell for a few weeks and eat commissary food until the bruises and cuts healed.The plan did not last long. The guards opened an investigation. Six inmates were sent to seg, Siatta said, including the two who had fought. Siatta was transferred to another house.His new cellmate was a member of the Latin Kings; among his many tattoos was the gang\u2019s symbol, a five-point crown. He laid down the rules. \u201cIn here, this house, it\u2019s our house, and we\u2019re cool,\u201d he said of their cell. \u201cBut out there you are not affiliated, and if you get in trouble I can\u2019t help you.\u201d Siatta left Shawnee for a court appearance related to his appeal and was held at the decrepit Pontiac Correctional Center before returning to Shawnee and a cell with another Latin King. The same code applied: We get along inside the cell. Out there we don\u2019t know each other.Siatta never quite found a friend. He tried participating in a veteran-support group but saw it as a sham. In his first session, when inmates were introducing themselves, an attendee claiming to be a former Marine mangled Marine Corps jargon. The counselor asked the man, who looked to be in his 30s, what rank he had held.\u201cGeneral,\u201d the inmate proudly answered.Siatta had heard enough. He never attended again.Each day Siatta had phone privileges. But calls to his mother, which he yearned for, usually left him disappointed. He would ask if there was news about his appeal, he said, \u201cand it was always just, \u2018No.\u2019\u2009\u201d The counseling he had attended at the V.A. with a therapist who knew him was replaced by a once-a-month, 15-minute mental-health checkup. \u201cIt was basically: \u2018Do you want to hurt someone? Do you want to hurt yourself?\u2019 and \u2018All right, see you next month,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. Depression gripped him again.He tried exercising during his yard time, knowing it soothed his symptoms. Some weeks he managed to work out in committed bursts, though three or four inmates were usually lined up at each piece of equipment, waiting a turn. But as his depression settled over him, he passed his weeks passively, unable to push through the pack. Mostly he slept \u2014 an activity he was assured of, because his cellblock was on lockdown 21 hours a day.Bernardi knew the outlines of Siatta\u2019s criminal file. I shared details from his combat tour: the boy shot through the head, the civilians struck by Hellfire missiles, Siatta\u2019s run of methodical killing in late 2009. It was all news to him. We talked about the frustration and anger many combat veterans share as their wars have dragged on with no visible end, and how Siatta\u2019s depression and PTSD were not unusual. We discussed the words of support from Cuomo, Siatta\u2019s former commander. \u201cHaving watched and fought, up close and personal, with Mr. Siatta, I remain humbled by his incredibly courageous actions,\u201d he had written. We also talked about the severity of Siatta\u2019s crime. A man of his background smashing into anyone\u2019s home was a frightening prospect.Bernardi\u2019s reaction surprised me. He looked at my notebook on the table, in a way those familiar with reporters do when they are about to say something quotable, and said, \u201cIf this case does not call for mitigation, then mitigation has no meaning.\u201dThe county\u2019s legal circle is small. Bernardi said the elected state\u2019s attorney, Jason Chambers \u2014 Alferink\u2019s boss \u2014 had practiced in his courtroom early in his career. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d he said, a reasonable lawyer who could see more than one side of an issue.A few hours later, I met Chambers in his office for a conversation with him and Alferink. We reprised the conversation with Bernardi. Alferink politely excused herself for a scheduled court appearance. Chambers was pleasant but inscrutable. I told him I planned to visit the crime scene and talk with the people who were in the house when Siatta broke in, and would get back to the prosecutors with questions.I was in New England two days later when Chambers sent me a text message. He asked for a phone number for Richard Winter, Siatta\u2019s attorney. That afternoon he called Winter and made an unsolicited proposal. He was ready to vacate Siatta\u2019s conviction, he said, and allow him to leave prison and plead to a lesser charge with a sentence of probation. And he was willing to make it easy. He wanted Winter to get documentation from the V.A. confirming that Siatta would be enrolled in mental-health care. Once he had it, the state would ask the appellate court to let Siatta out of Shawnee \u2014 immediately. They would work out the new plea deal later.Until this point Siatta had little inkling of his shift in fortunes. Winter had kept his mother up to date on Chambers\u2019s plans, but she did not want her son crestfallen if they stalled or were rejected in appellate court. She had told him only that Winter was working on his case and that \u201cthere might be some news one of these days.\u201dThat afternoon, after lawyers and the appellate-court clerk refined the language and conditions for a court order, the appellate judges issued an order to release Siatta on a $10,025 bond, pending disposition of his appeal.A guard escorted him to a prison office. Siatta was unsure what was happening. \u201cThey asked me, \u2018Where\u2019s your property?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me later that day. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Why? Why do I need my property?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Because you are going home.\u2019\u2009\u201dSiatta was escorted back to his cell with a plastic bin to collect his possessions. The guard gave him three minutes \u2014 barely enough time to hand off a coffee cup and about 20 packages of ramen noodles and chocolate-chip cream pies to his latest cellmate, who was serving 12 years.\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Siatta said.\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re going home?\u201d he asked.\u201cI guess my lawyer is working on some stuff, and I\u2019m getting out of here,\u201d Siatta said.The cellmate, whose prospective parole date is in 2022, shook his head.Minutes later, Siatta was gone, walking down the cellblock, carrying the bin. The prison officials inventoried his possessions \u2014 a hot pot, a few books and magazines, a pair of plastic flip-flops \u2014 and handed him an envelope with $63.90 in cash, the balance from his commissary account. Someone gave him a pair of gray sweatpants and a white T-shirt, and Siatta changed out of his prison blues. He kept the white sneakers with his inmate number, Y11107, handwritten on the side. He looked very much a prisoner still. A guard told him to sit and wait. His possessions were transferred to a cardboard box.After an hour or two, Siatta was led through a series of heavy doors to Shawnee\u2019s reception area, where T.G. Taylor, the former Army officer who first told me of Siatta\u2019s incarceration, was waiting. \u201cHey,\u201d Siatta said and smiled lightly. Taylor explained that he would be driving him to a motel in Marion, where his mother would meet him. They spoke in the clipped language of two grunts readying for a patrol.\u201cAre you good?\u201d Taylor asked.\u201cI am good,\u201d Siatta said. He walked across the lot, past the guards\u2019 cars, with an expressionless face. In the car, he was subdued. He ate a cheeseburger as Taylor tried to explain what just happened. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d Siatta said.Taylor called Maureen. \u201cWe have him,\u201d he said. Maureen had posted his bond in Bloomington and was en route to meet them. Siatta took the phone. \u201cHey, Mom, how you doing? I\u2019m good. What? I did, yeah. Where you guys at? An hour and 10 minutes away. You\u2019ve seen Shawnee before. It\u2019s not great. Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.\u201dHe hung up. Behind the wheel, Taylor had a wad of snuff tobacco behind his bottom lip. There had been no tobacco in prison. \u201cYou, uh, wouldn\u2019t have a pinch of that Copenhagen, would you?\u201d Siatta asked.Taylor shared what he had and pulled into a convenience store to buy another can. He asked Siatta to wait in the car. He had been released so quickly that he risked being mistaken for an escapee.In the motel lot beside the highway, Taylor opened a duffel, found a workout shirt and tossed it to him. Siatta now looked like the free man he was. He headed to the motel coffee bar, made a tall cup and positioned himself with his back to the lobby wall, watching the entrance. For an hour, he paced between the lobby and Taylor\u2019s room, until Maureen showed up. She and her son walked slowly toward each other and locked in a silent and almost motionless embrace.When she let go, she addressed Taylor with near disbelief. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, over and over, softly.Siatta borrowed her phone. He had a call to make.Ashley Volk was home in her kitchen in Chicago. She had been working graveyard shifts tending bar. She knew that Winter had been trying to get Siatta out but did not know about Chambers\u2019s offer, or that a release was imminent. She saw Maureen\u2019s number and answered.Siatta\u2019s voice was on the other end.\u201cLove,\u201d he said.\u201cOh my God!\u201d she screamed. She fell against the kitchen cupboard and then to the floor, where she curled up, sobbing. Through the phone she could hear Siatta. He was crying, too.Chambers described a criminal-justice system that resembled an overworked mill. His office handles almost 5,000 cases a year, he said, and it was not possible for him to follow each of them closely, much less read all the case materials. In Siatta\u2019s case, he said, the journal that illuminated his combat history was not available during the plea-negotiation phase. It showed up just before trial.After we met the first time that spring, he said, he reviewed the file and found the journal. By the time he was done reading, he said, he was not surprised Siatta had ended up in handcuffs. \u201cYou take a 19-year-old and you put them in this extreme situation where they are being asked to do things \u2014 or maybe not asked, but are choosing to do things \u2014 that are contrary to the values they had growing up, and the U.S. government pats your back and says, \u2018Good luck,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that is not a recipe for something to go wrong.\u201dFrom his point of view, Chambers said, the plea deal in the works was not actually a large shift. Siatta had received the minimum sentence for a Class-X felony and would soon plead to more than the minimum sentence for a felony one class down. \u201cFrom a practical standpoint, it is a big change,\u201d he said, because Siatta was out of prison. \u201cFrom a legal standpoint, it is a hair\u2019s width apart.\u201dAnd for society, Chambers added, the new arrangement was probably safer. If Siatta were to behave well in Shawnee, he would be eligible for release in less than three years and would return with virtually no counseling or care for his PTSD. Now Siatta would be under state supervision for several years, receiving care throughout. \u201cThe rationale for me became, \u2018What makes people safer over the long term?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cIs it treatment or just getting him off the street?\u201dThe man who had fought Siatta in the house in Normal found that his feelings had changed, too. Though he himself did not serve in combat, the Marine Corps remained central to his life. He served four years as a clerk and was honorably discharged as a noncommissioned officer. G.I. Bill benefits helped underwrite his college studies, and his brother was on active duty. Having been sequestered as a witness during the trial, he did not hear details of Siatta\u2019s combat tour until January, at sentencing, and as he learned more he came to see Siatta as a drunken Marine who did something stupid. The home invasion was not personal. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was just a random act,\u201d he said. When Chambers called him in the late spring to discuss vacating Siatta\u2019s conviction, he listened to the prosecutor\u2019s new proposal. After he thought about it, he told me: \u201cI wasn\u2019t angry anymore. I was ready to put it past me and to forgive.\u201dHe felt sluggish. He did little more in the first weeks than visit Volk and go to the gym. \u201cHis energy level was way down,\u201d she said. Volk was struggling as well. The months Siatta spent in Shawnee, Volk said, had passed for her in gray procession. Every day was tasteless and colorless. But she understood that Siatta had it worse. Now that he was back, she was patient, willing to let therapy have its effects and allowing him to set his own pace. She was thrilled by his shift in fortune \u2014 \u201cwhen I saw him, it was like being reborn,\u201d she said \u2014 but was not expecting a fairy tale. When he seemed withdrawn, she invited him to walk. \u201cWe took the dogs around the block,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next time, we walked a few more blocks.\u201dBy the fall, Siatta was making his appointments, in good standing with his probation officer and going out more. He was physically fit. The V.A. reduced his disability rating from 70 percent to 50 percent \u2014 a shift suggesting that doctors there felt his PTSD had less of a hold on him. When I visited him in late November, we ate three meals together in restaurants over four days. Each time he was amiable with the staff and did not appear vigilant. Twice he sat with his back to the door. He had not had a drink in almost two and a half years. His eyes seemed bright, his voice light, his demeanor relaxed. He was also looking for a job, although it was hard as a felon on probation to get past a background check. He was almost hired by a moving company, he said, until he told the supervisor of his conviction. He had not given up. Volk thought she might soon have something lined up for him to check IDs at the door of the sports bar where she worked.While he waited, he was splitting time between his mother\u2019s home and Volk\u2019s place, and speaking of marriage. Volk knew where he had been and what he had done, and she accepted it all. Familiarity, Siatta suggested, was relief. \u201cExplaining is exhausting,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve got most of it done.\u201dOne morning after meeting his probation officer, Siatta was in the basement of his mother\u2019s house, hitting a heavy bag. Upstairs in a scrapbook were photographs of his life, including one taken days before he left home for the Marines, when his recruiter had brought the family a cake. He was a shy kid with acne and muscular arms, able to do 28 pull-ups even before arriving at boot camp. He did not look much older now, in the basement, working the hanging bag. He had wrapped his hands with tape. His legs and feet were bare. Sweat beaded on his shoulders. The air carried the smack of each impact, followed by a pause. He was striking the bag steadily, resisting the urge to acknowledge the sharp pulsating in his hands as he tried to build pain tolerance and toughen his fists. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to break your hand on someone\u2019s face,\u201d he said.I asked him whether entering the ring with one good arm to exchange blows with a trained fighter carried more risks than he might want, especially considering the delicate platinum coils in his neck that could be dislodged. He seemed tired of the question. It was the type of discouragement he had heard since telling friends he was enlisting in the Marines. \u201cIf my dream was to be a lawyer or doctor, something that was socially acceptable, then everybody would be happy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I tell people I want to be a fighter, they are like, \u2018Ooh, you\u2019re going to fuck yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201dPeople warn him that he is going to get hurt, he said, and \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Well, it is fighting, so that\u2019s almost a definite.\u2019\u2009\u201d He hoped to earn enough money to pay the hospital bills. Hands throbbing, face blank, his left-side targeting system not quite right, Sam Siatta hit the bag.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Second Avenue Subway\u2019s Arrival Brings Fear That Rents Will Soar", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byFew cities in the world are as closely linked to their subways as New York City \u2014 the vast network helped shape the city and now carries nearly six million people a day. So when the most ambitious expansion of the subway system in half a century opens on Sunday, it will be a transformative moment, promising to alter the future of a large slice of Manhattan.The new Second Avenue subway will provide badly needed relief to one of New York\u2019s most congested transit corridors and is expected to be a boon to the local economy, making restaurants and stores suddenly easier to reach. But even as the city celebrates a line many doubted would ever open, its arrival has prompted fears that rising rents could force out longtime residents and shops \u2014 the kind of displacement that has swept through many other parts of an increasingly affluent New York and deepened its inequality.One of those is Dina Zingaro, who gravitated to the neighborhood when she moved from New Jersey. She and a roommate pay $2,400 a month for a two-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor of a walk-up building.While the new line will shorten her trip to work, she worries that it could also bring a major rent increase and ultimately push her out of Manhattan.\u201cIf it was over $200, that would be tough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to consider moving.\u201dThe elevated lines were razed in the 1940s and 1950s, to the delight of many residents who viewed them as noisy eyesores and expected a new subway line to open soon. Instead, the area became a rapid-transit desert, one of the few neighborhoods in Manhattan that the subway did not reach.But this has also made the neighborhood relatively affordable by Manhattan standards. Yorkville\u2019s median rent is about $2,700 per month, lower than Manhattan\u2019s rate of about $3,300, according to StreetEasy, and there are clusters of rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments.Local businesses are bracing for steep rent increases. Peter Psirakis, the owner of a shoe repair shop on Second Avenue near 70th Street, worries that his rent each month, now more than $6,000, could rise by thousands of dollars. He would likely have to shut his store when his lease ended in a couple of years.\u201cI\u2019m here 23 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t go to another neighborhood and start a business from the beginning.\u201dAt the same time, though, many restaurants and shops are also eagerly anticipating the return of foot traffic; many people avoided the area when construction of the subway line began in 2007. Tunnel blasting rattled buildings, broke windows and produced noise and dust. Local business leaders held a news conference recently on Second Avenue with Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents the area and is a longtime supporter of the project, to praise the anticipated economic stimulus.A lifelong resident of the neighborhood, Carol McCabe moved to Knickerbocker Plaza on Second Avenue in 1975. Ms. McCabe, 67, who runs a senior center in the complex, is struggling to pay her rising rent of about $3,000 per month after her husband died, and might eventually have to leave New York.\u201cI\u2019m not so certain about the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my apartment.\u201d\u201cWhere I have to place much of my focus is on helping rent-regulated tenants stay in their apartment and exercise their rights,\u201d said Mr. Kallos, a Democrat who has also pushed to set a height limit on so-called superscrapers in the neighborhoods he represents.Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said the administration\u2019s top priority remained protecting affordable housing and building new units.\u201cWe pursue that goal in every neighborhood in the city, including on the Upper East Side,\u201d Mr. Finan said.Still, the Upper East Side is unlikely to become suddenly hip, said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University.\u201cThe neighborhood is intrinsically boring,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t live there for excitement. They live there for stability.\u201dSome predict an influx of high-end shops and more chain stores, even as shuttered storefronts along Second Avenue highlight the places that closed rather than wait out the disruptive construction.Dave Goodside kept the Beach Cafe restaurant open, borrowing money, laying off employees and sometimes working nonstop to remain afloat.

The layoffs and closing in Sellersburg follow similar shutdowns by Manitowoc in Ohio and Wisconsin.\u201cI\u2019ll give Trump his due, but I hope he and the American people and Congress don\u2019t forget about all these other jobs going to Mexico,\u201d said Chuck Jones, the president of Local 1999 of the United Steelworkers in Indianapolis, which represents Carrier. \u201cDown the pike, a lot more are going to be moving out.\u201dIndeed, Rexnord, the ball bearing factory in Indianapolis where Mr. Jones went to work straight out of high school nearly 40 years ago, said in October it would be moving to Mexico. It is just a mile from the Carrier plant.The mayor of Indianapolis, Joe Hogsett, and Senator Joe Donnelly, both Democrats, tried to exert Trumplike pressure to force Rexnord to rethink its plans, but so far the company has not shown any sign it will change course.\u201cOn a personal level at Carrier, it is huge,\u201d said Jerry N. Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. \u201cBut by itself, the disappearance or retention of 1,000 jobs is a small slice of the total economy in Indiana.\u201d\u201cI think there will be continued downward pressure on employment in factories because of trends toward automation especially and moving to lower-cost areas for production,\u201d he added.How the president-elect\u2019s deal measures up to U.S. manufacturing job losses.Carrier, in its official statement on the deal on Wednesday, said that it thought the agreement it negotiated with Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u201cbenefits our workers, the state of Indiana and our company.\u201d But it said that incentives provided by Indiana, where Mr. Pence is governor, \u201cwere an important consideration.\u201d It added that \u201cthe forces of globalization will continue to require solutions for the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and American workers.\u201dThe good news is that Indiana has been doing well economically, with an unemployment rate below the national average and steady gains in employment like food service, retail and logistics.But those service jobs pay well below the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran Carrier employees \u2014 with only a high school diploma \u2014 can earn building furnaces and fan coils in Indianapolis. The typical manufacturing worker in the state earns $59,000 a year, about $20,000 a year more than the typical service job.And for less credentialed workers, that margin is the difference between having a shot at a middle-class life, including owning a home and sending children to college, and having to struggle to make ends meet.\u201cThese are truly irreplaceable jobs,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an advocacy group, and a native of Rensselaer, Ind. \u201cA manufacturing job is one of the only ladders to fulfilling the American dream for a worker without a college degree.\u201d\u201cA manufacturing worker who loses their job at Carrier will be resigned to facing a lower standard of living and leaner retirement years,\u201d Mr. Paul added. \u201cCarrier is special because it happened at the right time and the right place and it gained a high profile. But obviously, Donald Trump and Mike Pence can\u2019t intervene every time a plant closes.\u201dThe economic fortunes for this group have been shrinking for years, which is a major reason the story of Mr. Trump and Carrier has resonated so deeply.Nor has manufacturing remained the sole domain of whites. It provides a crucial source of higher-paying jobs for minorities.In the popular imagination, the Indianapolis factory where 1,400 Carrier workers build furnaces and fan coils looks like a scene out of \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d or \u201cNorma Rae.\u201d Blue-collar guys walking through the plant gate, lunch pail in hand, or white women barely getting by after years on the line.But the reality at the Carrier plant that Mr. Trump will visit on Thursday is very different. About half the workers are African-American, making it a much more diverse workplace than many white-collar settings.Women account for a substantial portion of the work force as well, but the wages are anything but subsistence: over $20 an hour plus benefits for workers with just a high school diploma. That is an almost unheard-of level of pay for Indiana workers with that level of education in other sectors like food service and retail or even many health care jobs.Carol Bigbee, 59, who has worked at Carrier for over 13 years, earns $22 an hour. Her daughter has a bachelor\u2019s degree and works in a medical lab, but earns one-third less.\u201cYou have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money,\u201d she said.In southern Indiana, where the Manitowoc Foodservice factory will close next year, good-paying blue-collar jobs are just as rare.But Rich Sheffer, vice president for investor relations and treasurer at the company, said it had little choice but to relocate to Mexico.\u201cThis company has 20 percent excess manufacturing capacity,\u201d he said. A few of the jobs are being transferred to Covington, Tenn., he said, but the Sellersburg plant \u201cwould have required a massive investment in automation. And we have to deal with profit margins that are trailing the industry.\u201dMr. Sheffer said his company\u2019s situation was different from that of Carrier, which has profitable operations in Indiana but could make more money in Mexico.\u201cOur motivation is completely different, but,\u201d he added, \u201cwe haven\u2019t been contacted by anybody in the Trump administration.\u201dA picture caption on Thursday with the continuation of an article about manufacturing jobs in the Midwest misstated in some editions the relationship between the women pictured. Arnita Gray and Carol Bigbee are co-workers at Carrier in Indiana; Ms. Gray is not Ms. Bigbee\u2019s daughter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Constitutional Referendum: What You Need to Know", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThe referendum would change 47 of the Constitution\u2019s 139 articles. Among the most significant changes would be provisions to alter the composition of Parliament, the way laws are passed and the balance of power between the central government and the country\u2019s 20 regions, in areas like infrastructure and food safety. If the referendum does not pass, the Constitution will stand as is.The most contentious provision affects the Senate, the upper house of Parliament. Under the current system, legislators in both houses must approve identical drafts of bills before the proposals become law, and any changes made by one house must be sent back to the other for approval.The referendum proposes a reduction of the Senate to 95 elected members from 315, along with five members nominated by the president. Of the 95, 74 would be chosen from representatives of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, while 21 would be chosen from mayors. The Senate would have a mostly consultative role, and most bills would only need the approval of the lower house.The referendum would provide for the definitive abolition of Italian provinces \u2014 a level of governance below that of the regions \u2014 and transfer some powers now overseen by the regions \u2014 like civil protection, strategic infrastructure and energy, and major transportation \u2014 to the central government in Rome, mostly reversing a change undertaken more than a decade ago, which devolved power to the regions.The referendum would abolish a national council on the economy and labor that advises the government and Parliament. It would tweak the process for electing judges to Italy\u2019s highest court and its governing body, as well as the procedures for electing the president of the republic, who serves as head of state. It would also make it easier for citizens to propose legislation.Each article has been the subject of intense debate. In broad terms, supporters say they believe that the changes will help streamline Italy\u2019s sclerotic legislative process, where laws can take months, if not years, to get passed.Opponents say the changes will concentrate too much power in the hands of the government, a risk that the drafters of the Constitution, written a few years after the downfall of Mussolini\u2019s fascist government, wanted to avoid. Many opponents argue that proposed overhaul of the Senate is too complicated, creates more problems than it will solve, and will grant parliamentary immunity to regional officials, a privilege they do not have.Mr. Renzi and his government would remain in power. In any case, Mr. Renzi has vowed to change a law passed in 2015 that would give the winning party a strong majority through the allocation of \u201cbonus seats.\u201d Elections would most likely be held in 2018, when the current Parliament\u2019s term is scheduled to end.Mr. Renzi would most likely resign. If he did, President Sergio Mattarella would consult with the political parties and could decide to form a caretaker government, possibly consisting of technocrats, or call early elections.Mr. Renzi might also choose not to resign, though that appears unlikely, given his statements in recent weeks.The political instability would probably have broader consequences throughout Europe, where populism is surging. There could also be economic repercussions, though analysts do not agree on the short- or long-term impact of a no vote.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do Trump Voters Want?", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "What Brad is getting at is the widespread belief by, well, almost everyone that they are entitled to \u2014 have earned \u2014 whatever good hand they have been dealt by the market economy. This is reflected in the more or less universal belief of the affluent that they deserve what they have; you could see this in the rage of rentiers at low interest rates, because it\u2019s the Fed\u2019s job to reward savers, right? In this terrible political year, the story was in part one of people in Appalachia angrily demanding a return of the good jobs they used to have mining coal \u2014 even though the world doesn\u2019t want more coal given fracking, and it can get the coal it still wants from strip mines and mountaintop removal, which don\u2019t employ many people.And what Brad is saying, I think, is that what those longing for the return to coal want is those jobs they deserve, where they earn their money \u2014 not government handouts, no sir.A fact-constrained candidate wouldn\u2019t have been able to promise such people what they want; Trump, of course, had no problem.But is that really all there is? Working-class Trump voters do, in fact, receive a lot of government handouts \u2014 they\u2019re almost totally dependent on Social Security for retirement, Medicare for health care when old, are quite dependent on food stamps, and many have recently received coverage from Obamacare. Quite a few receive disability payments too. They don\u2019t want those benefits to go away. But they managed to convince themselves (with a lot of help from Fox News etc) that they aren\u2019t really beneficiaries of government programs, or that they\u2019re not getting the \u201cgood welfare\u201d, which only goes to Those People.And you can really see this in the regional patterns. California is an affluent state, a heavy net contributor to the federal budget; it went 2-1 Clinton. West Virginia is poor and a huge net recipient of federal aid; it went 2 1/2-1 Trump. I don\u2019t think any kind of economic analysis can explain this. It has to be about culture and, as always, race.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japanese Leader Offers Condolences in Visit to Pearl Harbor", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byPEARL HARBOR, Hawaii \u2014 Seventy-five years after Imperial Japanese warplanes destroyed the Pacific fleet here and drew the United States into World War II, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on Tuesday stood next to President Obama at the site of the attack and offered repentance but did not apologize.\u201cI offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place, and also to the souls of the countless innocent people who became victims of the war,\u201d Mr. Abe said.He added, \u201cWe must never repeat the horrors of war again.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Obama described in detail what occurred on the day of the attack, highlighted acts of heroism by American service members and said that the visit of Mr. Abe \u201creminds us of what is possible between nations and between peoples.\u2019\u2019Mr. Obama added, in what seemed a warning after the scorching American presidential campaign: \u201cEven when hatred burns hottest and the tug of tribalism is at the most primal, we must resist the urge to turn in. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different. The sacrifice made here, the angst of war, reminds us to seek the divine spark that is common to all humanity.\u201dThe president and prime minister made their remarks at the end of a long pier that overlooks Pearl Harbor and the memorial to the attack \u2014 a small building on top of the carcass of the battleship Arizona in Pearl Harbor, where 2,400 American sailors, Marines and others were killed in the surprise military strike on Dec. 7, 1941.Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama laid wreaths made of white peace lilies at the memorial, and then dropped purple Hawaiian orchids into the water.The war that began here ended with the United States dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. But out of the ashes of war, the two countries forged one of the most enduring partnerships of the past century, demonstrating that bitter enemies can make peace and become allies.Mr. Abe thanked the United States for helping to rebuild Japan after the attacks.\u201cUnder the leadership of the United States, Japan, as a member of the free world, was able to enjoy peace and prosperity,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cThe good will and assistance you extended to us Japanese, the enemy you had fought so fiercely, together with the tremendous spirit of tolerance, were etched deeply into the hearts and minds of our grandfathers and mothers.\u201d\u201cSeventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the time.\u201cTechnological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that such technology \u201crequires a moral revolution as well.\u201dThe Japanese have long had difficulty making sense of their country\u2019s decisions during World War II. Some have rationalized the attack on Pearl Harbor as a necessary response to an American-led embargo that was destroying Japan\u2019s economy. In the 1950s, three Japanese prime ministers\u2014 including Mr. Abe\u2019s grandfather Nobusuke Kishi \u2014 visited Honolulu, although there is no record that they participated in a memorial ceremony at Pearl Harbor. In the decades that followed, senior Japanese leaders largely avoided the site.When Emperor Akihito planned to visit the memorial in 1994, nationalist protests in Japan led to his canceling the visit.But six months after Mr. Obama visited Hiroshima, Mr. Abe told the president in a meeting at an economic forum in Peru that he wanted to visit Pearl Harbor. In a statement earlier this month, the White House said that \u201cthe meeting will be an opportunity for the two leaders to review our joint efforts over the past four years to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance, including our close cooperation on a number of security, economic, and global challenges.\u201dThe Japanese, who are increasingly alarmed about the rise of China, have largely embraced the visit, as many see it as a way to strengthen ties with the United States. In Japan, NHK, the public broadcaster, played the speeches live, but otherwise, early media coverage of the speeches was muted. There have been suggestions in the Japanese news media that Mr. Abe\u2019s approval ratings will rise in the days after the ceremony, strengthening his hand as he decides whether to call an election in January.Mr. Abe has made closer ties with the United States a central part of his foreign policy, at least under Mr. Obama. President-elect Donald J. Trump has struck a far more hawkish tone toward Japan. During Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Hiroshima, Mr. Trump, at that time the presumptive Republican nominee, said on Twitter: \u201cDoes President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\u2019s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost.\u201dMr. Abe met with Mr. Trump in November at Trump Tower, in a meeting that Mr. Abe\u2019s aides said left him feeling optimistic about the prospects of Japan\u2019s relationship with the United States. But the Japanese remain deeply unnerved about Mr. Trump as they view his statements and the suggestion that Japan should acquire its own nuclear arsenal as undermining its strategic alliance with the United States and antithetical to the country\u2019s pacifist Constitution.Before Mr. Obama and Mr. Abe visited Pearl Harbor, they had a formal meeting at Marines Corps Camp H. M. Smith, where they discussed a wide range of issues, including trade.The day\u2019s events interrupted Mr. Obama\u2019s vacation. Since becoming president, he has spent every Christmas in his native Hawaii. He arrived here 10 days ago and has spent his time golfing and seeing friends. On Christmas Day, he and his wife, Michelle Obama, visited troops stationed here. He is expected to be in Hawaii through the New Year.The day marked what is likely Mr. Obama\u2019s last meeting with a foreign leader as president, as there are just 24 days left before Mr. Trump is to be sworn in.Motoko Rich and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tata Steel Makes a Deal to Stay in Britain, Saving Up to 11,000 Jobs", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Tata Steel said on Wednesday that it had reached an agreement with trade unions to provide at least a temporary reprieve for the largest steelworks in Britain.In the deal, which still needs to be approved by employees, Tata, a subsidiary of Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate, would keep the giant steel plant at Port Talbot in South Wales and other parts of its steel business going in Britain until 2021, preserving as many as 11,000 jobs. Tata had been trying unsuccessfully to extricate itself from making steel in Britain.In return, the unions have made substantial concessions including an agreement in principle to close their generous pension plan and replace it with a new one that would require employees to pay more for their future retirement.The deal comes as a relief for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Tata\u2019s highly publicized troubles with high costs and cheaper imports have put many thousands of jobs at risk at a time when Britain\u2019s plans to leave the European Union are creating doubts about the future of the country\u2019s economy.The agreement \u201cmarks an important step forward in the journey to develop a sustainable future for our U.K. steel business,\u201d Koushik Chatterjee, the group executive director of Tata Steel, said in a statement.For months, Tata has been sounding out potential buyers, while at the same time negotiating with the unions. Those efforts evidently did not find an attractive price, leading Tata to reconsider.\u201cThey risked being embarrassed twice,\u201d said Dalton Dwyer, managing director of Industry Corporate Finance, a London-based firm that advises industrial companies on mergers. \u201cThey bought at the top of the market, and they didn\u2019t want to bail out at the bottom of the market.\u201dLoss of steel-making at the Port Talbot plant, which has two blast furnaces for making raw steel, would have been devastating to the economy of South Wales, a once-thriving industrial hub that has seen many high-paying jobs disappear in recent decades. Union officials say the deal will still need to be approved by their members.In addition, Tata\u2019s approach appeared to have changed after Cyrus Mistry, the parent group\u2019s chairman, was ousted earlier this fall and replaced with his predecessor, Ratan Tata. Mr. Tata had acquired the company\u2019s European assets, then called Corus, in 2007.Tata says it continues to talk to ThyssenKrupp, a German steel-making company, about combining the two companies\u2019 steel operations in a joint venture. Analysts say that ThyssenKrupp is more interested in working with Tata\u2019s Dutch operations than with their British counterparts.As part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Tata also said it would invest in plant upgrades, automation and other initiatives. The company declined to say how much money it would spend.Mr. Dwyer and other analysts say that there is reason for Tata executives to figure the fortunes of their British subsidiary might improve. British and European steel makers have been hammered in recent years by a of weak demand for their products and competition from imports from China and other countries.The European Union has slapped higher tariffs on some imported steel products, while Britain\u2019s plans to bolster spending on infrastructure, like a new runway for London\u2019s Heathrow Airport and a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Southwest England, would stoke demand for steel.As by far Britain\u2019s largest steel producer, Tata could be well positioned.In his statement Mr. Chatterjee of Tata said that \u201cglobal economic uncertainty, slow manufacturing growth and currency volatility\u201d all presented \u201csignificant challenges to the business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(The 2015 awards were viewed by 7.5 million people; the 2014 ones, 9.25 million.) And because her choices throughout the two terms of her husband\u2019s administration have been watched with increasing intensity (\u201cMichelle Obama stuns in XX\u201d is the typical headline post-Honors ceremony), and this is her last ceremony as first lady. And because this is only the second time she has worn Gucci, the first being in September on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d when she wore a vintage map-print dress.As it happens, the soon-to-be-former Italian prime minister has had a very close relationship with the Italian fashion world, which in turn gave him its full support \u2014 in many ways not unlike the way the American fashion world embraced Hillary Clinton during her campaign for the presidency.This was a big deal, as traditionally, prime ministers, while understanding fashion was one of Italy\u2019s most celebrated global exports, were loath to be seen as too cozy with an industry associated with luxury.And, as if in acknowledgment of fashion\u2019s favorite presidential candidate, \u201cwe are available to welcome the new president of America, whoever she may be.\u201dLittle wonder that as the referendum drew near, fashion voiced its support in turn, with Patrizio Bertelli of Prada and Ferruccio Ferragamo of Salvatore Ferragamo telling WWD that they were behind him.Now, of course, like the American fashion industry, they are left in limbo, waiting to see who follows Mr. Renzi: whether they will take an equally supportive and friendly approach to the sector or turn a colder shoulder; whether their bet on the losing horse will come back to hurt them; whether their relationship with Rome is about to be reframed.Maybe Mrs. Obama wasn\u2019t thinking about any of this when she chose the custom-made green and pink off-the-shoulder metallic silk crepe Gucci gown she wore Sunday night. Maybe she just thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s pretty.\u201d Because it was.But more likely, given her history with dress and the way she has used it as a strategic tool, she was also doing what she could to stress the importance of Italian fashion at a delicate time; making a discrete gesture of solidarity with a country and an administration and an industry. What was it? To paraphrase Mr. Taylor \u2014 they\u2019ve got a friend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Mexico City Is Everyone\u2019s Now", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Places that live on in the author\u2019s memories have been wholly transformed as tourists discover her hometown.Supported byIn the hourlong traffic jam from Mexico City International Airport, on a road clogged with cars, buses and trucks, I keep glancing out the window, looking for familiar signposts, streets, neighborhoods, name places, threads of childhood memories.This is the city where I learned to read and write, where I first went to school, where I first visited a museum, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and first saw the murals of Diego Rivera, Jos\u00e9 Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros. This is where I learned to roller skate, on the tiled courtyard of our colonial-era apartment building on Calle Genova in the Zona Rosa, and where I learned to ride a bicycle, at Chapultepec Park, and crawled up the pyramids of the Sun and the Moon in Teotihuacan and floated in gondolas down the flowering canals of Xochimilco. I remember getting lost at the circus; walking to school, my mother holding my hand; the smell of corn on the cob grilled over coals at roadside stands.Now, a lifetime later, I am returning to this place. Just minutes after checking into a hotel in Colonia Roma, an eclectic bohemian neighborhood of cafes, galleries and plazas, I head out into this confounding city, to see it on foot, from the ground, to touch it and smell it. The doorman warns me that a storm is coming, but I set off anyway down the tree-canopied streets and busy, crisscrossing avenues. Though it had been decades since my last visit to Mexico City, I am sure I will find my way around, even in the evening, even in the rain.I have a destination, a mezcal dive called La Clandestina. I want to celebrate my arrival in Mexico with my first taste of mezcal, and I had been told that La Clandestina is the coolest mezcaleria in town. I stroll up and down streets. Vendors and policemen, waiters and bartenders offer directions, pointing in every direction, sending me around in circles. The rain is now coming down. Sidewalks and gutters flood, outdoor cafes and storefronts empty. I am soaked when I come upon a fellow in dreadlocks leaning in the doorway of a dark storefront. La Clandestina? I ask. He grins, obviously expecting the question.\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he says, and waves an arm toward a back room. A couple seated at a corner table glance over at me and go back to their drinks, their faces difficult to make out in candlelight. High-pitched laughter is coming from a foursome throwing back shots in a partly enclosed room. A server appears with a mezcal menu, and the dreadlocked guy pulls up a stool beside me, lines up several shots filled halfway. I wince with every gulp and beg off after the sixth shot. Instead, I order a mezcal Negroni. I sip, pay the tab and manage to find my way back to my hotel, on foot, in the dark, in the rain. The hotel staff tells me the next day I am one lucky girl. I think it\u2019s magic.Mexico City comes at you fast, in multitudes, on streets lined with funky bars, glass towers, rundown houses, taco stands, cantinas, designer shops, fancy restaurants, artsy hotels. Life is lived out on the streets, in plazas and parks, in the mercados and commercial strips, in the elite colonias and poor barrios that spread far into the mountains. Few places are as maddening, as beautiful and mysterious, as mystical.Today, against all odds \u2014 drug cartels, kidnappings, killings, corruption \u2014 Mexico City is a world-class luxury getaway, bursting with fine cuisine and hotels, salons and exclusive nightspots, the playgrounds of tourists, celebrities and the sons and daughters of the country\u2019s richest families.Tourism is booming in this megalopolis of 22 million people, which this section called the No. 1 Place to Go in 2016. The most progressive city in Latin America, it had 6.3 million foreign visitors in 2015, a jump from 4.9 million in 2012, and is home to 700,000 American expatriates, retirees, writers, artists, executives.The capital, but not the rest of the country, legalized same-sex marriage in 2010, a rarity in Latin America, and the tourist industry is marketing itself to gay travelers to increase its $17.1 billion haul in 2015, which was up from $12.7 billion in 2012.Often set against a grim image of poverty and violence, Mexico City vies with S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, for the title of richest city in Latin America. With a per-capita income of $18,000 a year, higher than that of many Latin American cities, the city has an expanding middle class and claims the 30th largest world economy.It should have been little surprise that the tourist\u2019s Mexico City largely overlapped with my own, since tourism has subsumed the city in some ways. As I wandered around the historic Centro on a bristling Saturday this summer, I pushed my way through crowds of families, couples and tourists, herds trampling down streets encircling the Z\u00f3calo, the city\u2019s epicenter, a large stone square built by the Spaniards over the ruins of the ancient Aztec city Tenochtitlan.Here, on weekdays, the business of the federal and local governments goes on inside magnificent Spanish-era palaces. But on weekends it turns into tourist central, local and foreign visitors snapping photos, posting selfies, standing in line at the entrance to the baroque Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace.Sports bars on the side streets of the Z\u00f3calo were packed that day with soccer fans howling at a Germany-France match on television screens. Shoppers shuffled along the Avenida Madero, massing around ice cream stands and taco dives, streaming in and out of discount clothing shops and the Gandhi bookstore. A few blocks away, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, a short line of visitors waited at the ticket booth (60 pesos a person, no United States dollars or credit cards accepted), young mothers with toddlers slogged up the steep marble staircase to reach the great murals.Little had changed at the museum since I first saw it as a child. It was still a cathedral, intimidating, august, and other than an arts bookstore behind a glass wall, there were few signs that much time had passed since I was an awe-struck schoolgirl. Outside, the scene felt familiar: Vendors spread souvenirs on sidewalks, protesters handed out pamphlets, teenagers smoked and jived, and, across the street, families picnicked at the Alameda Central park.Cutting across several streets, I reached the Mercado de San Juan, so famous it\u2019s listed in travel guides. Dozens of pollerias, open-air poultry stands stacked with freshly killed chickens, lined blocks around the mercado. Inside, I walked by boxes showcasing glossy fruit (those cherries!), spotless vegetables from everywhere in the world, and rare delicacies, like 15 varieties of Japanese mushrooms. After I made a few rounds, recalling the dusty, fly-covered street mercados of my childhood, I saw why the airy, clean halls of Mercado de San Juan draws chefs and foodies.On the way back to the hotel in Colonia Roma, I took a detour to Zona Rosa, where I lived as a child. We had come to Mexico City from Puerto Rico so my father could study medicine at the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico. While he spent hours in school, my mother, a lawyer, did the household chores. After three years in Mexico, we returned to Puerto Rico \u2014 she to resume her career and he to finish training and start his own practice. Now our apartment building on Calle Genova is gone. I couldn\u2019t find my old school, the Van Dyke Academy, a cloister of bespectacled nuns and high gates. The neighborhood is now a hive of gay night life, clubs and shops. Those markers of my childhood were erased from the real world and exist now only in my mind. I made my way back to Roma.There, La Cervecer\u00eda de Barrio was gearing up for the evening weekend crowd. I grabbed a stool with a view of the Fuente de Cibeles, a replica of the Fuente de Cibeles in Madrid. It\u2019s the neighborhood\u2019s plaza, a traffic circle furnished with crayon-color folding chairs and umbrellas, tables. Bars, cafes and small shops encircle it. Neighborhood regulars, runners and bikers gather around the plaza, a scene common to the city\u2019s moneyed colonias like Roma and its neighbor La Condesa, a quiet and more exclusive enclave of boutique hotels, Art Deco and California architecture and tree-lined esplanades along historic Calle Amsterdam and Parque Mexico. Colonias Roma, Condesa and Polanco form the city\u2019s fanciest triangle. If Roma and Condesa recall the Marais in Paris, Polanco channels Beverly Hills.Great cities usually define themselves through literature and art, fashion, theater, music, diversity. Mexico City has plenty of all that. Now in this millennial city, where the median age is only 27, a new generation of chefs is leading a cultural surge, creating a gastronomic movement and giving the city a new cachet.\u201cThey are visionaries,\u201d Carlos Puig, a columnist for the newspaper Milenio, says over lunch at Aguamiel, a no-frills restaurant in Roma specializing in Oaxacan food. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had visionaries,\u201d he says \u2014 but this time they are not just looking inward; they have a global vision. He and his wife, Yissel Ibarra, a film producer and documentarian who works for the Instituto M\u00e9xicano del Cinematograf\u00eda, know their way around the restaurant scene. They agreed, after some discussion, that Enrique Olvera, the celebrated 40-year-old chef at the highly acclaimed restaurant Pujol, is the leader of the Mexican cuisine revolution.Though it was suggested by local residents, it\u2019s safe to say that Pujol\u2019s reputation is baked in by now. It is the darling of local foodies and international critics and chefs. The restaurant, 16 years old, had its breakthrough in 2010, when Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, the chef of one of the world\u2019s top restaurants, Noma, in Copenhagen, visited Pujol and went away raving to the world.The gastro scene in Mexico City exploded. \u201cThere was lots of combustion,\u201d Mr. Olvera told me in July over coffee at his popular New York City restaurant, Cosme (he is to open a second restaurant in Manhattan this year). The food revolution in Mexico \u201csurprised everyone but I knew it would happen,\u201d he said.\u201cI dreamed about this when I was younger,\u201d he continued. \u201cI knew that we had the potential to create a new cuisine.\u201dSo I went to see it for myself. On a leafy street in Colonia Polanco, Pujol announces itself quietly. The staff speaks in whispers and steps softly around an intimate space of dark gray walls, delicate artwork and candlelight shadows. It has the elegance of a jewel box and the solemnity of a church. The menu arrives in a sealed parchmentlike envelope, like a royal edict. Couples, small groups of friends and society beauties fill the room. Dishes come and go, more than I can count, more than I can properly appreciate, all exquisitely presented. The evening proceeds slowly, at a choreographed pace. The noise level never rises. I am in awe. Nothing like this existed in Mexico City when I was a child, and though I later grew up going to elegant restaurants, Pujol stands in a class of its own even today.\u201cI think Mexico has had an inaccurate and bad rap until recently,\u201d said Trisha Ziff, a British documentarian and filmmaker who has lived in Mexico City for 12 years. We were at lunch at Maximo, where an Olvera prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Eduardo Garc\u00eda, is turning out some of the town\u2019s best French-accented Mexican food.\u201cBeing the recipient of endless attacks creates a strange kind of freedom, a creative anarchy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe take risks because we have nothing to lose. This culture takes risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so vibrant. It\u2019s the same with food, with music, with fashion. It\u2019s the youth and energy which gives the city its dynamism.\u201dThe city\u2019s tourism and cultural boom did not happen overnight. It reached critical mass in the past year or so.\u201cIt\u2019s the young generation,\u201d said Patricia Mercado, an economist who helps run the city government from an office overlooking the Z\u00f3calo. Breaking away for a few minutes from government business, she listed the influences that shaped the city\u2019s rise: liberal policies, human rights and education, legal abortion and same-sex marriage, and a powerful feminist movement in which she is a major voice.The city\u2019s secretary of culture, Eduardo V\u00e1zquez Mar\u00edn, put it this way: \u201cThis is a city of refugees, a city of immigrants, a city of great cultural diversity.\u201dWe met at the cavernous Museo de la Ciudad, and he was saying that the city\u2019s refusal, in 2006, to join the federal government\u2019s all-out military-style war on the drug cartels helped explain how the capital has remained relatively secure in a country where 100,000 people have died in drug violence in 10 years.The memory of the students is much alive in Mexico City. A large red sculpture in the shape of the number 43 stands in the main boulevard, Paseo de la Reforma.Looking back decades, Mr. V\u00e1zquez traces the turning points and intersecting factors leading to his city\u2019s resurgence. He goes back to the devastating 1985 earthquake, which galvanized the capital and created a lasting spirit of unity. Then, in 1997, the city elected a liberal government that promoted social and economic reforms. Abortion was legalized in 2007 and same-sex marriage in 2010, defying Mexican traditions and the Catholic Church, pulling the city into the 21st century.\u201cThe city is the locomotive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the future of the country.\u201dAfter six days at Hotel La Casona in Roma, I check into Las Alcobas in Polanco, on Masaryk Avenue, the city\u2019s Rodeo Drive. Las Alcobas is not far from Ricardo Legorreta\u2019s 1968 masterwork, the Camino Real hotel, a dazzling apparition washed in brilliant yellows and pinks. The facade of Las Alcobas pales by comparison, but the concierges greet you like royalty and the compact lobby, centered on a rosewood spiral staircase, reflects the hotel\u2019s luxurious and comfortable design.With no schedule to follow, I take a long walk along the Paseo de la Reforma through Chapultepec Park. The park had been a favorite place growing up, where I learned to bike and ride donkeys. Under the cover of giant trees I meander, taking in a sidewalk photography exhibit and a display of giant soccer balls designed by Mexican artists. Orange and blue pedal boats dot the placid lakes. Long lines stand at the boat rental gates and at the taquerias and food carts. It\u2019s a weekday but it feels like the Sundays in the park I remember.A few hours later, on my last evening in Mexico, I am coddled on a red velvet banquette at one of the city\u2019s most talked about restaurants, Dulce Patria. The room evokes the dazzling colors, architecture and art of Mexico. Frida Kahlo inevitably comes to mind. The chef, Martha Ortiz, is one of very few female top chefs in Mexico, and, at 49, is older than most of the new celebrated chefs. Her restaurant provokes extreme reactions. Some people I know hate it, others love it.My entree, a pork loin prepared with rare Mexican plants and vegetables, arrives on a plate decorated with sweeps of color brush strokes. The plate alone is worth framing. At dinner\u2019s end, Chef Martha stops at my table. She is tall, thin, with dark hair combed off her angular face. She leans down and extends a thin hand. Then, just as suddenly, she is gone.I stroll back to Las Alcobas, thinking about the swirling colors on the plates and the scarlet and ruby shades, the emerald greens and indigo blues of Dulce Patria. So Mexico.Luisita Lopez Torregrosa, a journalist and author, is a professor at Fordham University and a former editor at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Chiefs Notably Absent From Trump\u2019s Cabinet of Business Advisers", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byIn President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s newly named kitchen cabinet of business advisers, Wall Street is in. Silicon Valley is out.Mr. Trump has named 16 business leaders to serve on what\u2019s being called the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, described as a group meant to guide his administration on economic matters.The list is notable for leaning toward New York executives and industries \u2014 finance in particular. The list echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for a number of major economic positions, including Treasury secretary (the former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager Steven T. Mnuchin) and commerce secretary (the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross).Given his long experience as a New York real estate investor, Mr. Trump\u2019s selections may not come as a surprise.\u201cDonald comes from the financial services world. I think he tends to pick people who he\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who is leading the forum effort, told CNBC Friday afternoon.It is a bipartisan list, nonetheless, with a number of members who traditionally have favored Democratic candidates, including Laurence D. Fink of the asset management colossus BlackRock, Mary T. Barra of General Motors and Robert Iger of Walt Disney.\u201cThis forum brings together C.E.O.s and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cMy administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise.\u201dThe group is expected to meet with Mr. Trump monthly. The first meeting will be at the White House in early February. Mr. Schwarzman will serve as chairman.Mr. Schwarzman was not a vocal supporter or fund-raiser for Mr. Trump. Since the election, however, he has embraced the notion that the president-elect\u2019s promise to pull back financial regulations and cut taxes will supercharge the economy.In public and in private, Mr. Schwarzman has lately said that he is \u201cexcited\u201d about the potential for economic growth in a Trump administration.\u201cThere are going to be so many of these changes that I think what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s really going to force growth from a policy perspective,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said at the conference.Despite his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Schwarzman has signaled privately that he would not commit to a full-time position in the administration, but was otherwise interested in helping to advise the president-elect.Other Wall Street heavyweights on the list are Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Adebayo Ogunlesi, a former Credit Suisse executive who is the chairman of the investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. Mr. Ogunlesi is also a board member at Goldman Sachs. No Goldman executives were named to the forum.Forum members with ties to the finance industry include Paul S. Atkins, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now the chief executive of a finance regulation consulting firm, and Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley executive and a former governor of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Dimon is easier to understand. Though initially a supporter of President Obama, the JPMorgan chief has long been critical of the current administration\u2019s financial regulatory overhaul. While his name had been floated as a potential candidate for Treasury secretary, people close to him have insisted that he had no interest in taking on a full-time commitment outside of his bank.Aside from Virginia M. Rometty of IBM, there is hardly any representation of technology companies, and certainly none from Silicon Valley.Indeed, many Silicon Valley luminaries have opposed Mr. Trump since the presidential campaign. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was an enthusiastic supporter of both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.The rest of the advisory group appears to be a bipartisan mixture of business chiefs drawn from the worlds of finance, media and manufacturing. They include Ms. Barra, Mr. Iger, Doug McMillon of Walmart and W. James McNerney Jr., formerly of Boeing.Mr. Trump\u2019s style and speech are sometimes seen as throwbacks to the Reagan administration, and Mr. Welch was the iconic business leader of that era.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women\u2019s Cricket Gains in Numbers and Visibility, but Gender Gaps Remain", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byAs in most sports, women\u2019s cricket has long been overshadowed by the men\u2019s game, but there are signs that that is changing.In a window into the growing popularity and self-confidence of women\u2019s cricket, Cricket Australia cleared the men\u2019s schedule last weekend for the beginning of the second season of the Women\u2019s Big Bash League, a Twenty20 cricket tournament.Australia has long established itself as the world leader in women\u2019s cricket, on the field and off. Since 2009, Australia has won four out of five International Cricket Council global events. There has been a 266 percent rise in maximum cricket earnings for women since 2011-12, and the top Australian players are now paid more than $100,000 a year.The soaring popularity of the Big Bash League also reflects broader advances in the women\u2019s game.In March, India hosted the men\u2019s and women\u2019s world championships in Twenty20 cricket, simultaneously. The International Cricket Council paid for all men\u2019s teams to fly business class, but women had to fly economy class.But next summer, when England hosts the Women\u2019s World Cup, the I.C.C. will pay for all teams to travel business class. In another landmark decision, women will be entitled to the same daily expenses as men, which \u201cdemonstrates how seriously the women\u2019s game is treated now,\u201d said Heather Knight, the England captain.There have been other significant developments in women\u2019s cricket in recent months. The West Indies became the first team from outside Australia, England or New Zealand to win the Twenty20 world championship. Ticket sales for the 2017 Women\u2019s World Cup in England, which begins on June 26, are far higher than for previous tournaments there.Last month, Cricket New Zealand chose a female president, the first time that a test nation had elected a woman to the role. In September, Catherine Dalton, an Irish cricketer, became the first woman recruited to coach a professional men\u2019s team.Perhaps most significant, Australia, which has been awarded the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Twenty20 world championships in 2020, has decided to decouple the two events, an indication that Cricket Australia believes that the women\u2019s tournament can thrive on its own.The division \u201callows the women\u2019s game to stand alone and not be overshadowed by their counterparts,\u201d said James Sutherland, the chief executive of Cricket Australia.While women\u2019s cricket, including the Big Bash League, remains subsidized by the men\u2019s game, it has been helped by a history of innovation. The first World Cup and the first Twenty20 international series happened in the women\u2019s game before the men\u2019s, reflecting how the women\u2019s game has often had more dynamic administration and been less encumbered by tradition.The emphasis on Twenty20 cricket, combined with the more merit-based and less hierarchical structure of the women\u2019s game, offers hope that women\u2019s cricket will gain in popularity beyond the sport\u2019s traditional strongholds. The men\u2019s game has historically been divided between the 10 so-called full member nations and 95 other countries, which are associate or affiliate members.Obstacles remain. The rate of progress in the women\u2019s game has been uneven throughout the world. There remains no women\u2019s version of the Indian Premier League, the lucrative Twenty20 league that began in 2008. Bangladesh and Pakistan, two cricket-mad nations, have been much slower to embrace the women\u2019s game.The amounts players are paid also vary widely. Only in Australia and England are salaries high enough for players not to have second jobs along with their cricket careers.The pay gap remains huge between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game. This year, the West Indies men and women won their world Twenty20 competitions on the same day. The men shared $1.1 million in prize money, but the women received only $70,000.\u201cThe game is developing at such a pace that one day this might not even be a question,\u201d Knight said of the gender pay gap. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can put a limit on how big women\u2019s cricket can become.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Call Gauged Positively, but Cautiously, in Taiwan", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 What a difference a phone call makes.China claims Taiwan as its territory and threatens to use force if Taipei officially acknowledges its de facto sovereignty. At her inauguration, Ms. Tsai said she wanted to improve relations with China, while also deepening ties with the United States and Japan.Ms. Tsai has moved her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, away from its pro-independence roots to a more nuanced form of Taiwan nationalism. The party\u2019s charter still features a clause advocating eventual official independence in the form of a Republic of Taiwan, although in July Ms. Tsai proposed replacing the clause with language that favors maintaining the status quo.On Sunday, Hung Hsiu-chu, the chairwoman of the opposition Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, said she was glad to learn of Mr. Trump\u2019s support for Taiwan.\u201cI am happy to see anything good for Taiwan,\u201d the KMT\u2019s website quoted Ms. Hung as saying.Ms. Hung\u2019s comment was notable because she has previously advocated unification with China. Her party lost the presidency this year after eight years of moving closer to Beijing, which did not reduce its threat to Taiwan. China has more than 1,500 missiles pointed across the Taiwan Strait.In interviews in Taipei, the capital, on Monday, residents said they were pleased about the phone call.\u201cI think that for the majority of Taiwanese people, this is the happiest thing that\u2019s happened to us since 1978, before the U.S. broke off diplomatic relations,\u201d Hsieh Jin-ho, a publisher and commentator, said in a phone interview.The United States formally recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan under the One China policy.Mr. Hsieh added that in general, Taiwanese had two different takeaways from the call.\u201cOne conclusion is that Taiwan needs to seize this opportunity in order to upgrade to fuller relations with the U.S. and expand its international friendly relations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother group of people fear that China\u2019s continually increasing pressure will grow even larger\u201d and threaten Taiwan\u2019s future.Speaking at her cafe in Taipei\u2019s Zhongshan district, Annie Hsieh, unrelated to Mr. Hsieh, smiled when asked about the call.\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Ms. Hsieh said. \u201cReading that it\u2019s the first time in 37 years that the Taiwanese president and American president-elect have spoken, I feel like it\u2019s major progress by the new government.\u201dChen Hui-ling, a lawyer, praised Ms. Tsai, whose party controls Taiwan\u2019s presidency and legislature for the first time.\u201cPeople who voted for the D.P.P. are paying attention to what it\u2019s doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to see if it will do something courageous, something different from the past.\u201dMs. Chen said she was struck by how most European lawyers she encountered on a recent business trip to London knew little about Taiwan.\u201cThey may have heard that there are some problems between Taiwan and China, but that\u2019s all they know,\u201d she said.Albert King, a fund manager, said the call was the main subject of conversation among his friends and associates.\u201cI think all Taiwanese are happy to see the president-elect of the United States say it\u2019s O.K. to say \u2018president of Taiwan\u2019 or talk to the Taiwanese people as if we are a normal country,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Americans look at this, but I think the president-elect has won the hearts of us Taiwanese.\u201dYet he also sounded a note of caution.\u201cWe all know from our history that international politics is about realpolitik,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have good faith, but we\u2019ll refrain from wishful thinking.\u201dIn 1978, when Washington announced it would shift official recognition of China to Beijing, it sent Taiwan into the diplomatic wilderness in which it still resides. Since then, Taiwan has evolved from a oppressive martial state into a wealthy, progressive democracy.\u201cIt\u2019s a long-awaited vindication of our denial by the world,\u201d Mr. King said of the Tsai-Trump call. \u201cEven after we\u2019ve achieved so much as a democracy, as a society, as an economy, we are not treated as equal to other countries.\u201dAlthough happy with Taiwan\u2019s moment in the sun, Jodie Lee, who works at an international nongovernmental organization in Taipei, is reluctant to place much faith in Mr. Trump.\u201cDoes this mean Trump is going to restore relations with Taiwan?\u201d Ms. Lee asked. \u201cOr did he only pick up the phone because the U.S. sells us a lot of weapons?\u201dMr. King described an increasingly unpredictable regional political environment, with the Philippines entering China\u2019s orbit, while Beijing\u2019s relations with Singapore have soured. And China will make important leadership changes next year.\u201cIt\u2019s all very delicate right now, so I\u2019m not surprised that China has been showing self-restraint,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good sign, but I would not be surprised if they change their mind and decide to react very strongly.\u201d\u201cThe tectonic plates are shifting, we know it will bring earthquakes,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk is definitely rising \u2014 I\u2019m an investor, I can see that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt Says Traces of Explosives Were Found on Bodies From Paris Flight", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byThe announcement by the Civil Aviation Ministry offers the strongest suggestion yet that a bomb might have felled the airliner as it flew to Cairo from Paris. Previously, officials had focused on a fire as a likely cause.Still, it was not clear why Egyptian officials had taken so long to draw the conclusion about explosives \u2014 most of the bodies were recovered from the sea by July \u2014 and experts said the cause of the crash remained a mystery.\u201cThe timing is odd, and the results are very late,\u201d said Shaker Kelada, a former chief aviation investigator with the ministry.Egyptian air crash investigations have a record of being slow, opaque and prone to political considerations. The authorities have yet to officially declare the cause of a Russian airliner crash in 2015 that killed 224 people; the Kremlin says it was caused by a bomb.Mr. Kelada said it might be no coincidence that the EgyptAir announcement came after the cathedral attack, at a time when President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was seeking to galvanize the country against the Islamist threat.\u201cThe whole thing is very much politicized,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the government thought this was a good time to say \u2018terrorism.\u2019 \u201dNo group has claimed responsibility for the EgyptAir crash. Some experts say there could be other explanations for the explosive traces besides a bomb.Readings from the plane\u2019s data and voice recorders, made public by Egypt during the summer, indicated that smoke had spread through the cockpit just before the crash, and that one of the pilots had warned of a \u201cfire.\u201dThe French authorities were cautious about Thursday\u2019s announcement and declined to draw conclusions from it.The French Foreign Ministry said that the investigation would continue, \u201cin order to determine the exact causes\u201d of the crash.In the early months of the investigation, senior Egyptian officials openly favored the bomb theory because it shifted potential blame away from the EgyptAir crew and the company\u2019s maintenance record, and on to the security procedures at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where the flight originated.A senior Egyptian aviation official said the latest crash update had been received by the government in November but was only made public this week for \u201cpolitical reasons.\u201d The official, who declined to elaborate, was not authorized to speak to the news media and spoke only on the condition of anonymity.Tarek Attiya, a spokesman for the Egyptian police, said prosecutors there would now turn to the French airport. \u201cThe prosecution will now have to go through diplomatic channels to uncover what happened,\u201d Mr. Attiya said. \u201cThe plane should have left the airport in Paris completely clean. It\u2019s completely their problem.\u201dFears of aviation-related terrorism have worsened the damage in Egypt\u2019s tourism industry, which has been struggling since the Arab Spring upheavals of 2011.The crash of a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula in 2015 devastated the economy along the Red Sea coast, where the flight had taken off, causing flight cancellations and hotel closings.The slump in tourism is a central factor of Egypt\u2019s foreign currency crisis, which has precipitated a sharp decline in the value of the Egyptian pound and has led to shortages of staples like sugar.Nour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}

They worried that a puppy would become neurotic or confused about which of the three apartments on different floors in the SoHo building where they live would be her real home. And who would be the real boss? Mr. King, a model? Mr. Swanhaus, a marketer? Or Ms. Radziwill, a Real Housewife on TV and real author?\u201cBut it has turned out that she knows her place in the world,\u201d Ms. Radziwill said.\u201cAnd she isn\u2019t needy, because what would she need?\u201d Mr. King said.\u201cShe gets to live in three one-bedroom apartments instead of one,\u201d Mr. Swanhaus added.Ms. Radziwill now has a boyfriend, Adam Kenworthy, a vegan chef who is fond of the dog too.\u201cI like her soft and fluffy, so I give her baths,\u201d he said.The other night, the \u201cco-parents,\u201d as they call themselves (never owners or masters), were lounging in Ms. Radziwill\u2019s well-appointed living room, which included one very important and now shredded French couch. It was previously owned by Lee Radziwill, Carole\u2019s mother-in-law from her marriage to Anthony, who died in 1999.But she gave herself to the arms of the others too, with the open-mindedness of an equal-opportunity pet that loves unstintingly and regardless of looks, age or number of followers.\u201cI always wanted a dog, but I didn\u2019t want one on my own,\u201d Mr. Swanhaus said.\u201cDogs don\u2019t like to be alone,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are eminently flexible in dealing with new situations, and they can get bored with the same routine every day.\u201dWhat\u2019s good for dogs may also be good for humans, and not just by easing their responsibility. Brad Faulkner, a young New Yorker who works in finance, is one of four friends who once shared a dog in a Manhattan apartment and now have shared custody. Sugar, a Border collie and Labrador mix, spends summers in New York and the rest of the year in Los Angeles, where two of the four roommates have relocated.\u201cIt\u2019s actually a great way to keep a friendship going with people who have moved across the country,\u201d Mr. Faulkner said.Sometimes sharing custody of a dog can even rekindle romance.Andrea Arden, a dog trainer, was dating a man and sharing his Doberman. When they broke up, he offered visitation rights, leading to getting back together and then getting married. \u201cHe told me it was because we were soul mates,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it had more to do with the dog.\u201dThey\u2019re now divorced and the dog is deceased, giving them a definitive ending.But custody can sometimes become a tricky issue. Jane Friedman, the chairman of Open Road Integrated Media, has taken in her son\u2019s dog, a Havanese, while he and his wife are dealing with a baby and toddler. The other day she joked that she wouldn\u2019t be giving the dog back. \u201cMy son got very sensitive,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I know not to bring the topic up again.\u201dWell, nothing\u2019s perfect. When it comes to sharing a dog, even in the most ideal circumstances, issues arise, including unstable rules and schedules from modular living.\u201cIf one person thinks it\u2019s O.K. to jump on the furniture and the other doesn\u2019t, then the dog will be confused by mixed messages,\u201d Ms. Arden said. In fact, one might meet Baby, the dog shared by Mr. King, Ms. Radziwill and Mr. Swanhaus, and find her slightly ill mannered at times. But then, who isn\u2019t these days?\u201cHousebreaking her was in my kitchen, and it was a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Swanhaus said. The responsibility had fallen to him because his kitchen was larger than Mr. King\u2019s, and it didn\u2019t have a newly refinished floor like Ms. Radziwill\u2019s. The dog managed to climb the gate and destroy an expensive carpet.After that, Ms. Radziwill wanted to send Baby for rigorous boarding-school training. The others rejected her plan. When they brought in a house-call-making trainer, not everyone attended or stayed through the sessions \u2014 naughty. And Mr. King didn\u2019t like the trainer\u2019s attitude.\u201cShe was a disaster, and she was also arrogant,\u201d he said.\u201cShe came highly recommended,\u201d Ms. Radziwill said with only a trace of irony from her living room chair. \u201cBut we stopped using her because Baby\u2019s such a well-adjusted dog.\u201dOf course just as there is room for improvement in any dog, there is room for human improvement too. Mr. King and Ms. Radziwill (she contends that she shoulders the brunt of dog care, including vet visits and bills) keep a strict feeding schedule. Mr. Swanhaus, who the others are quick to point out has never bathed the dog (although he did once buy shampoo), leaves food out all day and doesn\u2019t stick with a rigid dog diet.\u201cHe\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t always enforce the rules,\u201d Mr. King said.Rule No. 1 for the humans? Never drop the dog off at another apartment (always arranged by texting) without walking her first. Ms. Radziwill recently broke that one. \u201cIt was the only time I did that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was so depressed after the election, I couldn\u2019t function.\u201dEvening was becoming night, and the team of co-parents seemed reluctant to leave their Baby and pull themselves together for a Saturday night. Mr. King went to set up an ironing board in Ms. Radziwill\u2019s kitchen to press a shirt to wear to a black-tie dinner at the home of Valentino Garavani. Ms. Radziwill had plans to join the radio journalist John Hockenberry. Mr. Swanhaus was to attend the opening of a new club, Paul\u2019s Casablanca, named for Paul Sevigny.Baby, who had once been the bridesmaid of Toast, the popular dog of Josh Ostrovsky, the Instagram celebrity known as the Fat Jew, had no plans. She played with abandon with the two kittens of Ms. Radziwill that had just finished climbing up her silk curtains.Ms. Radziwill, who like her fellow co-parents doesn\u2019t have children, smiled at the menagerie of animals and men. \u201cSo far none of us have plans to move,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that ever happens, we may end up in a custody trial. But we don\u2019t like to think about that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nine New Findings About Inequality in the United States", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementThe average pretax earnings of an American in the bottom 50 percent by income was $16,197 in 2014, a nearly invisible 2.6 percent gain over 40 years. Over the same period, the top 10 percent of Americans saw their pretax incomes grow by 231 percent.By comparing pretax income to income after accounting for taxes and government spending, we can see a clearer picture of how government policy has affected income inequality in the United States.The effects of government assistance vary widely with age, especially within the lower half of incomes. Younger adults between 20 and 45 years old have seen their after-tax incomes flatline.But over the same period, seniors in the bottom half have seen their after-tax incomes grow by over 70 percent. The bulk of that gain represents increased health care spending through Medicare.Forty years ago, the top 1 percent of earners took home 10.5 percent of the total national income, and the bottom half earned 20 percent of it. By 2014, those percentages effectively flipped, with the top 1 percent earning a 20 percent share and the bottom half dropping to 12.5 percent.Between the end of World War II and the 1980s, the gap between effective tax rates on the rich and the poor narrowed as a result of reductions in corporate and estate taxes on the upper class, and increases in payroll taxes on the working class.In 2013, the Obama administration sharply reversed the trend of declining top tax rates by allowing the 2001 Bush tax cuts to expire and introducing new surtaxes to fund the Affordable Care Act.Since the 1960s, more American women have joined the work force and their pay has increased, counteracting measures of inequality. In 1964, women made up only 38 percent of the work force; they are now nearly half of it.Despite these gains, as you look farther up the income ladder, you find fewer and fewer women.Women are 48 percent of the American work force, but only one in 10 of the top 0.1 percent of earners.Even for the upper-middle-class group, which the authors define as adults with incomes between the bottom half and the top 10 percent of Americans, pretax incomes haven\u2019t grown over the past 15 years. Only rising public spending on benefits like health care has allowed upper-middle-class incomes to grow.Over the past 50 years, the total share of national income that flows back to individuals through the government has grown. And that income has increasingly been transferred to the bottom 90 percent of Americans, helping to slightly slow the rapidly growing income inequality in the United States.Because the labor income of the bottom 50 percent of Americans has weakened so drastically, Mr. Piketty, Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman write, \u201cthere are clear limits to what redistributive policies can achieve.\u201dThey argue that future policy should focus more on raising the primary income of the American working class. Possibilities include improving education and job training, equalizing distribution of human and financial capital, and increasing labor bargaining power, combined with a return to steeply progressive taxation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Accepted, Soon Rejected? New York\u2019s Young Immigrants Uncertain Under Trump", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byVanessa Luna arrived in New York as a 10-year-old from Peru, and grew up as an undocumented immigrant. While her parents worked at cleaning jobs, she hid her status in high school until a guidance counselor helped her get into the State University of New York at Binghamton to study American history.She was a junior there when, in 2012, President Obama gave Ms. Luna \u2014 and hundreds of thousands of other young people like her\u2014 temporary permission to stay and work in the United States. She could become a teacher.\u201cFor the first time, I felt like this country accepted me,\u201d said Ms. Luna, 25, who now teaches social studies at a middle school on the Lower East Side.But now, she does not know what to think.During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump promised he would cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Mr. Obama initiated. But in comments he made to Time Magazine last week, the president-elect seemed to soften his stance.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Mr. Trump said, without offering specifics, though a Senate bill with bipartisan sponsorship introduced last week would continue DACA\u2019s protections for three years.On that, Ms. Luna agreed. \u201cFor someone like me, that uncertainty still looms,\u201d she said.Across the country, more than 740,000 young immigrants, often called Dreamers, are wondering what will happen to the two-year work permits granted through DACA. They work in fields like education, law, medicine, finance and government. About 30,000 live and work in New York City, officials say.At the age of 5, Chandrapaul Latchman was brought by strangers on an airplane from Guyana to reunite with his parents on Long Island. He became student body president of Valley Stream Central High School, an honors student at Baruch College and an intern at BlackRock, the investment firm, before going to work at JPMorgan Chase. Today, at 23, he is one of the bank\u2019s 100 credit risk analysts, assessing multimillion-dollar loans to real estate developers and entertainment companies.He knows what he would feel were Mr. Trump to cancel the program, known as DACA.\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of rejection,\u201d Mr. Latchman said.\u201cEven though you tried so hard, and outworked so many people to get here, still at the end, you\u2019re not good enough and they don\u2019t want you,\u201d he said.Because Mr. Obama initiated the program by executive action, Mr. Trump could still revoke it with the stroke of a pen. It does not need congressional approval.Without the right to work legally in the United States, the Dreamers could see the accouterments of middle-class life \u2014 a studio apartment in Brooklyn, a driver\u2019s license, a biweekly paycheck with deductions for retirement, a coveted desk in a financial firm \u2014 disappear.Some viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments as polarizing, continuing a narrative from his campaign.Otherwise, she said, the alternative is frightening: \u201cWe\u2019ll save DACA and all their parents will be deported \u2014 who will want to stay here?\u201dMr. Latchman said that even before Mr. Trump was elected, his manager suggested exploring other offices around the world, like the one in Toronto. His work permit expires in the summer of 2018, about the time his three-year contract with the bank ends.A JPMorgan Chase spokesman, Andrew Gray, said that it was too early to discuss what was still a hypothetical situation. He emphasized that Mr. Latchman was speaking personally, and not on behalf of the company.In many cases, employers, whether they are private or government entities, may not know if an employee has a work permit through DACA unless that person discloses it. And there is little any employer can do if an employee\u2019s work authorization is canceled.Antonio Vance, the executive director in New York for Great Oaks Charter School, said he had already consulted lawyers to help Ms. Luna.\u201cShe\u2019s only been here a year, and she\u2019s already a model teacher,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cIt would be difficult to replace her and the relationships she has formed with her students.\u201dMs. Luna said that if were she to lose her work permit, she would consider going back to school for a degree in administration in hopes of one day opening her own school if the law changes. She already has a master\u2019s in urban education and policy.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to say it won\u2019t devastate me. But it would ignite more of a fire inside me,\u201d she said, referring to her ambition to remain a teacher in the United States.Others said their fallback plan might mean retreating to the underground economy.Joe Luft, the executive director of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, which operates 15 high schools in New York City that specialize in teaching new immigrants, said losing people like Mr. P\u00e9rez could adversely affect the students who had come to confide in him.\u201cI really fear what that does to their sense of hope, which can be tenuous to students anyway,\u201d Mr. Luft said.According to an immigration lawyer, Stephen Yale-Loehr, Mr. Trump could still cancel the program immediately, or let the existing two-year work permits simply expire.Ms. Naveed said it would be \u201ca significant loss\u201d of independence to no longer be able to work and take part in her community openly. Still, she said, \u201cBefore DACA people survived, and after DACA people will survive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tied to Europe, Britain\u2019s Car Industry Is Vulnerable After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byBURNASTON, England \u2014 On Toyota\u2019s brightly lit assembly line here, workers guide wheel and engine assemblies into unfinished sedans. Driverless carts carry parts through narrow aisles to work stations. The assembly line moves with clockwork precision, able to pop out a vehicle every 72 seconds.Britain\u2019s automotive industry, once ailing and plagued by strikes, now hums with the vibrancy of a global manufacturing hub. Most of the cars made in Burnaston, models like Auris and Avensis, will make their way beyond the British borders. Toyota buys parts and hires workers from across the European Union.But the level of integration, previously lauded, has made the carmakers especially vulnerable after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the bloc. If a messy divorce follows, Toyota and others face the prospect of higher tariffs, a smaller labor pool and less access to the 500 million potential customers in Europe \u2014 all of which will be negotiated in the coming months and years.The drop in the British pound since the vote has not been much help, either. Many of the carmakers\u2019 contracts here are priced in euros, even with suppliers in the same country like Johnson Controls, which makes seats for Toyota.\u201cWe have made clear that if we lose some of these elements, it will make making cars in the U.K. less competitive,\u201d said Anthony J. Walker, deputy managing director of Toyota Manufacturing in Britain. \u201cWe would have to reduce costs, which would be very hard.\u201dCarmakers like Toyota are now in full-on defense mode. Toyota and others are telling the government that they need continued, unfettered access to the European Union, for exports, imports and engineering talents, which they say is in short supply in Britain. Toyota is particularly concerned that its just-in-time manufacturing system \u2014 which requires that parts arrive at the plant in a certain order just a few hours before assembly \u2014 should not be disrupted.\u201cIt is absolutely suicidal,\u201d said Peter Tsouvallaris, the plant\u2019s senior representative for the union, Unite, which also represents workers at other carmakers. \u201cI am concerned about the long-term future of the plant because we don\u2019t know what Brexit means.\u201dThe British government understands the stakes for the country, which is home to a cluster of world-class plants for overseas automakers like Nissan, General Motors, BMW and Honda. The sector employs about 169,000 and accounts for about 12 percent of the value of British exports, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, an industry group.Already, the British prime minister, Theresa May, has shown a protective streak. The government has promised to invest 390 million pounds, or $485 million, to encourage advanced, low-emission vehicles, including driverless and electric cars. It has said it will continue to fund training for Toyota and other auto companies, as well as encourage development in component makers based in Britain.Britain also offered assurances to Nissan, whose plant in Sunderland became a flash point in the time before the vote over the so-called Brexit. Although specifics have not been made public, Nissan said in October that it would build a new version of its popular Qashqai and another model at the plant.\u201cThe support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us\u201d to make the investment decision,\u201d Nissan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, who had recently met Mrs. May, said at the time.That clout has been hard won for an industry that was struggling not so long ago.Britain always had a flair for car design, producing such classics as the Jaguar XKE and Austin-Healey Sprite. But the industry in the 1960s and 1970s suffered from underinvestment, dated models, poor quality and frequent strikes.The outlook began to change in the 1980s, as Japanese automakers began to look for a foothold in Europe to gain access to the single market. Britain beckoned. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it was increasingly welcoming to foreign investment, unions were in retreat, and Britain\u2019s own auto industry was not much of a competitive threat.Toyota came in the early 1990s, finding a large site in central England that could be cleared and built to the company\u2019s specifications. The Japanese companies brought efficient production methods. The nearby industrial center of Derby welcomed the new manufacturing jobs at a time when jobs at other companies were being lost.\u201cThe Japanese completely reversed what was going on,\u201d said Garel Rhys, a professor emeritus of motor industry economics at Cardiff University. \u201cThey showed that Britain was not a place that was out of control.\u201dThe Japanese carmakers brought a more team-oriented approach to once-contentious British manufacturing.Workers at the Toyota plant, who make more than 30,000 pounds on average a year ($37,360), are called \u201cmembers.\u201d To avoid delays when snags arise on the line, they pull a cord summoning help from a team leader, denoted by two yellow stripes on the navy blue baseball caps all workers wear.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Toyota\u2019s collegial approach has helped with labor relations at the plant, which is unionized. Toyota says it has lost no time to strikes in about a quarter-century of manufacturing in Britain.\u201cThe main reason is their philosophy,\u201d said Mr. Tsouvallaris, the union representative. \u201cThere is always a channel open for communication.\u201dOther automakers soon followed their Japanese rivals.In the early 2000s, BMW of Germany began building a new line of Mini cars in Oxford. Later that decade, Tata of India took over the old British brands Jaguar and Land Rover.It has helped grease Britain\u2019s economy.Over all, the country made about 1.6 million cars last year. The figure, though much smaller than in powerhouses like the United States and Japan, leaves it roughly level with France as Europe\u2019s third-biggest automaker, after Germany and Spain.Toyota has invested \u00a32.2 billion in the Burnaston operation and an engine plant in Wales. Together, they employ around 3,200 people. Britain remains a heavyweight for Toyota, producing about 30 percent of the company\u2019s cars in the region.The industry is now plagued with uncertainty.The British prime minister wants to start negotiations in early 2017 on the terms of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, talks that could last two years or more. The spectrum of possibilities is broad, from Britain remaining part of the single market to the country facing high barriers to trade with the Continent. Both sides have their own competing interests with carmakers, putting the industry in the middle of a potential fraught negotiation.\u201cThe car industry really did take the prospectus of the E.U. at face value,\u201d said Stephen Adams, a partner at Global Counsel, a political risk firm in London. \u201cIt relies on the free circulation of goods in the E.U. not just to sell products but to make products.\u201dToyota has options if the Burnaston plant ultimately proves unprofitable.The carmaker has more than 30 vehicle manufacturing plants around the world and, like many of its rivals, pits them against each other to bid for the right to make various models. Toyota also has a string of plants across the region, including large car-making hubs in France and Turkey.The company has had to trim operations at Burnaston before, closing an assembly line in 2010. Annual production is down to 180,000 from a peak of 282,000 in 2006.Mr. Walker, the Toyota executive, says a new model for Burnaston is under consideration, although no decision has been made.The plant has already handled several changes to models in its history. On display in the reception area is the Avensis, versions of which are exported to Japan.\u201cThis is the only plant in the world that sends cars back to Japan,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cWe are very proud of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It has also damaged Dentsu\u2019s reputation and brought scrutiny from labor authorities and prosecutors.\u201cWe are taking this seriously,\u201d the Dentsu president, Tadashi Ishii, said at a news conference. \u201cI offer my heartfelt apology.\u201dHe said he would tender his resignation to Dentsu\u2019s board next month but would remain in his post until March to give the company time to choose a replacement.Working late has long been seen in Japan as a badge of corporate loyalty, repaid by employers in the form of ironclad job security. Both the security and the loyalty that many workers feel have eroded in recent years, as cultural norms have shifted and Japan\u2019s economy has struggled. But the problem of health-threatening overwork has persisted.In a government report on karoshi published in October, nearly a quarter of companies surveyed said some employees were working more than 80 hours of overtime a month. The true percentage is probably higher, since the survey relied on self-reporting.Dentsu is known as a particularly demanding employer. A president in the 1950s urged its employees to work single-mindedly to complete tasks and satisfy clients, \u201ceven if it kills you.\u201d The company continued to print the exhortation in training materials until after Ms. Takahashi\u2019s death, when it had it removed, according to multiple Japanese news reports.In the aftermath of the suicide, Dentsu is trying to change its culture.The company has begun turning off the lights at its headquarters at 10 p.m., as a signal for employees to go home. It also now requires workers to take at least five days off every six months. Its employees are entitled to more vacation days than that but, fearing censure from bosses and colleagues, many never take them, a common phenomenon in Japan.After examining the circumstances of Ms. Takahashi\u2019s death, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare ruled that its underlying cause was overwork, a finding that entitled her family to compensation. Ms. Takahashi was not alone in working punishing hours, the ministry said. Its investigators searched Dentsu\u2019s offices in November and found what they said was evidence that Dentsu had underreported overtime hours worked by several dozen other employees.The ministry has referred the case to prosecutors as a potential violation of labor laws. A separate criminal investigation is not yet complete, and no charges have been filed.Ms. Takahashi told her Twitter followers and family members that she not only worked too much, but that she was bullied by her bosses. The harassment, she said, took the form of faultfinding about her work and sexist comments about her appearance.As her exhaustion deepened, she said on Twitter, her supervisors chided her for coming to work with \u201cmessy hair and bloodshot eyes\u201d and told her she had \u201cno femininity.\u201dShoichi Nakamoto, Dentsu\u2019s deputy president, acknowledged at the news conference that \u201cthere was power harassment by supervisors.\u201d\u201cWork was sometimes assigned inappropriately,\u201d he said, \u201cwith emails early in the morning and the middle of the night.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Worried Auto Industry Braces for Change Under Trump", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 First the Obama administration bailed out much of the American auto industry, pulling it out of a tailspin. Then it reshaped the business, with regulations and policies intended to increase fuel economy, improve safety and add jobs.Now, under President-elect Donald J. Trump, the industry is bracing for another wholesale makeover. Perhaps no industry could be affected in more ways by the new administration than the auto business.The changes under the Trump administration could include possible tariffs that will raise prices on imported vehicles and parts, fewer subsidies for electric cars and policies that discourage automakers from moving products from American factories to Mexico.And any scaling back of fuel-economy goals by the Trump administration, if Mr. Pruitt\u2019s climate change skepticism and embrace of fossil fuels translates to policy, could also influence the types of vehicles the industry plans to build in coming years \u2014 and where it builds them. Bigger models like sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are less fuel-efficient than cars but more profitable for automakers. And their steeper price tags can help pay for the higher labor costs of making them in the United States.In a move that underscored the new psychology since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ford Motor \u2014 which had been a target of his criticism \u2014 in mid-November decided to keep building a Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky rather than Mexico.And yet, for a capital-intensive industry that routinely makes billion dollar bets on new factories and products, the uncertainty is unnerving.\u201cOur membership is just perplexed right now,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, vice president for public affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen carmakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota, on safety and environmental issues. \u201cThis is all uncharted territory.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign was studded with promises that could upend the status quo, including some to relax policies intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has yet to detail any coming changes. But pursuing policies similar to those he promoted in his campaign could change the entire manufacturing industry by penalizing companies for investing overseas or by stifling free-flowing global trade.One industry analyst, Ron Harbour of the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said many voters in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio backed Mr. Trump primarily because of his promises to restore manufacturing jobs in the United States.\u201cSo there probably will be pressure to do something,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t do anything, they probably are not going to be too thrilled.\u201dMr. Trump will inherit an auto industry that is far healthier than when President Obama took office and industry officials could push back strongly on disruptive changes.But auto executives generally support Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of a former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, Elaine Chao \u2014 who is also the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell \u2014 to head the Transportation Department. The department oversees fuel-economy and safety rules that affect the types of vehicles that automakers produce.\u201cWe all have a common interest, and that is to maximize the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy,\u201d the auto alliance said in response to Ms. Chao\u2019s appointment.No change would be more consequential to the auto industry than applying steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and elsewhere. Companies could be forced to radically change how and where they get commodity parts, the production of which has been migrating to low-wage nations for decades. Consumers could see a change in the types of cars available.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, the American automotive industry and auto jobs have been buoyant since the Obama administration\u2019s bailout.Since 2010, vehicle production has doubled in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been hired. Last year, a record 17.4 million cars and trucks were sold in the United States, and analysts forecast strong demand for several years.\u201cYou have record levels of production and record levels of demand,\u201d said Mike Jackson of the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThere is every reason for the industry to emphasize that it\u2019s in a very strong position.\u201dStill, the industry is anticipating changes from Mr. Trump. Ford, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker after General Motors, uncharacteristically made public a decision to keep production of the Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky, after Mr. Trump had singled out the company for its growing investments in Mexico.Ford, like G.M., Fiat Chrysler and nearly every foreign automaker, has a huge stake in protecting the interlocking network of factories and parts suppliers made possible by Nafta.Plants in Mexico are crucial to meeting surging demand for new vehicles in the United States. Beyond that, automakers have already committed big investments to new plants in Mexico to take advantage of its cheaper labor and export-friendly trade agreements.While Mr. Trump has yet to specify how he would renegotiate Nafta, his emphasis has been on increasing American jobs and discouraging automakers from using foreign plants to supply the American market. His proposal to put tariffs of as much as 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico has stunned auto executives who have built their business models on open borders for cars, trucks and the thousands of parts in them.\u201cA tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Mark Fields, chief executive of Ford.Imported vehicles are an integral part of the American market and account for more than 40 percent of its annual volume. Last year, about eight million cars, trucks and sport utilities sold in the United States were built elsewhere, primarily in Mexico, Canada, Japan and Korea. Nearly all of them enter the market free of tariffs that would increase sticker prices significantly.Increasing the price of an imported vehicle with tariffs could reduce overall vehicle sales and exert economic pressure on manufacturers as well as on freight haulers, dealerships and independent service centers.And if Mr. Trump chooses to impose tariffs on auto parts produced abroad and shipped to plants in the United States, the impact will spread further.Last year, auto parts worth $143 billion were imported into the United States, about 35 percent of them from Mexico, compared with $81 billion in parts that were exported, according to the Commerce Department.Many big suppliers, however, are global and make parts in every region of the world.The parts industry\u2019s largest American trade group, the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, said its member companies employed more than 734,000 workers in the United States, and generated another 2.9 million jobs in related businesses. The industry is acutely sensitive to changes in trade policies that could have a ripple effect on its ability to ship parts in and out of the country.And like automakers, parts manufacturers are anxious to know what Mr. Trump has in store for them.\u201cNow that the election is over, we can begin to explore what to expect in the months to come,\u201d the trade group\u2019s president, Steve Handschuh, wrote in a letter to its members, adding that he was eager \u201cto express our priorities\u201d to the Trump transition team.In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on trade issues, the industry is expecting policies that diverge from the Obama administration\u2019s enthusiastic support of electric cars, including the $7,500 tax credits that encouraged consumers to buy them, and for the testing and development of self-driving vehicles.In a Nov. 10 letter to the Trump transition team, the auto alliance asked for clarity on policy changes as soon as possible. \u201cAuto manufacturing is a highly capital-intensive business, and because of that we rely on long-term certainty,\u201d Ms. Bergquist wrote.Yet the industry has proved to be adaptable to shifts in government, whether by building more fuel-efficient vehicles to meet new regulations, or increasing investments in Mexico because of Nafta.It is also more focused on self-interest than politics. In its eight-page letter, the auto alliance laid out several goals \u2014 including repeating its position that the government re-evaluate its timetable for automakers to achieve fleetwide fuel economy of 54.5 miles a gallon.But while the letter was perceived as tailored to Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, Ms. Bergquist said it was composed before the election and would have been sent to an incoming Clinton administration had the outcome been different.\u201cOur position was the same, no matter who won,\u201d she said.Neal E.

{"Headline": "Dear America, Why Did You Let Us Down?", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 On the other side of the world from you, we are living in two time zones. One regulated by the rise and fall of the sun, the other regulated by the American news cycle. In our early afternoon you go to bed, in our late evening you wake again and news breaks afresh. We examine the entrails of the tweets of your president-elect for news of our common future.In Australia, and around the world, we have been living this presidential transition with you. We watched the debates on our lunch breaks, we scrolled through news on our phones as the voting results were announced, in the warm light of a spring day.Since the election I have cried many times, in the shower, in the car, as the conventions that define liberal Western democracy are stripped away by Donald J. Trump, with every distressful appointment, each impulsive outburst. I have embarrassment of grief for a government that is not mine and for a country that does not belong to me. It feels as if we\u2019re mourning the death of an idea called America.You may not know us, the people beyond your borders, but we know you. We absorbed your politics by osmosis, across the semipermeable membrane of celluloid. We know about Air Force One from \u201cAir Force One\u201d and the West Wing from \u201cThe West Wing.\u201dWhen I think of the political texts I know by heart, snippets of yours spring to mind \u2014 \u201cask not what your country can do for you\u201d; \u201cI have a dream\u201d; \u201cconceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\u201d As a child I knew the Gettysburg Address and the Pledge of Allegiance, not because it was taught in class but because we heard them so many times in movies like \u201cKindergarten Cop.\u201d America gave us a poetry of democracy that was grand and uplifting, which we were too reserved and sarcastic to speak for ourselves.Visiting America itself gave us the sensation of having stepped into the television, into something bigger and better. For a time when I was a teenager my father worked in the coal industry in West Virginia. He would return with stories about new things we could not imagine, like cable television with 50 stations. Packed in his suitcase were running shoes for us, in styles that had not arrived here yet. That was more than 20 years ago.Things were changing long before this election. Trips to Asia are now more likely to startle us with modernity. Bangkok, Singapore, even Mumbai have shocked me on visits over the last few decades, not just the wealth and development but also the music and fashion and public transportation.For all the intractable problems in our region, there is a sense of forward movement. When we visit America now, it feels like the opposite, like decay. Roads, airports, an economy, perhaps even a society, falling to pieces. We are left in awe by the extreme poverty as well as the extreme wealth. And maybe it is because of your poetry about yourself that the turning current has been harder for Americans themselves to see.And here we Australians are on the edge of Asia, a small and loyal ally of the United States, with a significant and growing Asian-born population, caught between our strategic alliance with you and our economic future with China. Britain is tangled in Brexit, with neither the time nor the inclination to focus on a former colony on the other side of the world. We feel worried, lucky \u2014 and alone.Earlier this year, Australia\u2019s Department of Defense outlined the long-term outlook for our defense and security, emphasizing that the relationship between the United States and China will continue to be the most strategically important factor in the region. \u201cThe governments of both countries have publicly committed to a constructive relationship and it is not in the interests of either country to see an unstable international environment in which the free and open movement of trade and investment is compromised,\u201d the department noted. That constructive relationship must now be spoken about in the past tense.\u201cThis society of ours is a better society than the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more even, it\u2019s more fair. We\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in real incomes in the last 20 years. Median America has had zero, zero.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have universal health protection, from the cradle to the grave.\u201dFor Australia to await a signal from the United States before thinking for itself \u201cis a complete denial of everything we have created here,\u201d he concluded.This is a way of moving forward, in our own direction and with our own voice. Perhaps we could even offer you a different model of democracy, the way you once offered one to us.Whatever happens, it will not dull my affection for the American people and the best of American culture. I was not raised in America, but I was raised in the American century.

{"Headline": "North Dakota Could Be Biggest Loser in Ruling Against Oil Pipeline", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byBut it is not the only one paying the price. For North Dakota\u2019s oil producers, once riding high on production from the booming Bakken fields, it is a new blow, after the plunge in oil prices that has shifted the industry\u2019s activity and focus back to more traditional oil regions.Fields with lower production costs in Texas and Oklahoma have been far more lucrative than North Dakota\u2019s in recent years. The pipeline was meant to give Dakota producers new leverage in the market by reducing their dependence on more costly rail shipments for delivery.North Dakota\u2019s Bakken field had been at the center of the shale oil boom that began in earnest in 2011, and oil company executives said the 1,172-mile pipeline would lower costs and help drive up production. Without adequate pipelines, and with slumping oil prices, production in the Bakken has fallen by about a third in recent years.Bakken producers are forced to ship much of their oil by rail, which adds costs of at least $4 and sometimes as much as $10 per barrel shipped. That created a critical disadvantage for companies like Hess and Whiting Petroleum, which had large stakes in the Bakken. A barrel of Bakken oil now sells for about $1.50 below the American benchmark \u2014 $49.77 on Thursday \u2014 rarely making it profitable to ship to major markets.In the meantime, even with oil and natural gas prices in a slump, there has been continued investment and activity in Oklahoma and, particularly, West Texas. Oil fields there have ready access to pipelines, refineries and the growing gas export market in Mexico. As a result, United States production levels have fallen less than 10 percent from record highs more than a year ago.Oil company executives argue that pipelines are not only cheaper but also safer than rail transport, citing a variety of fiery train accidents involving oil in the United States and Canada in recent years.They also note that the Dakota Access pipeline would have the capacity to transport roughly 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Bakken shale fields to refineries in the Midwest, meaning it could be a critical link in coming years if oil prices recover and energy demands increase in a growing economy.And Energy Transfer, which owns and operates 62,500 miles of pipelines across the country and has a market value of nearly $20 billion, is not giving up on the Dakota Access, which, except for the disputed segment \u2014 about a mile long \u2014 is almost complete.\u201cWe are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting,\u201d the company, which is based in Texas, said in a statement.Officials at Energy Transfer declined interview requests.The company has gone to court to challenge the decision to block the disputed part of the route and to seek alternatives to allay Native Americans\u2019 concerns that the pipeline would cross sacred burial sites and pollute drinking water.Energy experts say Mr. Trump might direct the secretary of the Army to reinstate a previous permit for the disputed pipeline segment or issue an executive order granting approval of the entire project. The Republican Congress might also be inclined to support Energy Transfer\u2019s interests.Those hopes may be why the company\u2019s stock price has climbed since last weekend\u2019s decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to block the route.If the decision is rescinded, the tribes and environmentalists involved in the protests would most likely go to court. A lengthy legal distraction for Energy Transfer Partners could become a long-running test for the nation\u2019s commitment to fossil fuels \u2014 as was the controversy surrounding the planned Keystone XL pipeline connecting Canadian oil sands to Gulf of Mexico coastal refineries. The Keystone XL dispute lasted for years before it was blocked by the Obama administration.If the Dakota Access fight continues, pipeline proponents might find a friendlier environment in Washington this time.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the costs of delays in the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline misidentified the nation\u2019s largest pipeline operator. It is Kinder Morgan, not Energy Transfer Partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guggenheim Helsinki Museum Plans Are Rejected", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byPlans to build a Guggenheim museum in Helsinki were defeated on Wednesday night, when lawmakers in the Finnish city voted down a proposal to pay for the $138 million museum with a mixture of private and public money.After more than five hours of debate, the 85-member City Council rejected the controversial plan, 53 to 32, meaning that the project to construct an art museum on the banks of the South Harbor of Helsinki will be abandoned, at least for now.\u201cThe main objections to the project presented by Council members included the project\u2019s excessive cost for the Finnish taxpayer; inadequate private funding; and the proposed site, which was considered too valuable for the project,\u201d the Helsinki Council communications department said in a statement issued after the vote.The Helsinki museum would have been the fourth satellite museum of the New York Guggenheim in the world, with other locations in Venice; Bilbao, Spain; and another planned for Abu Dhabi.Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation in New York, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that he had believed the museum could substantially raise the cultural profile of Helsinki and that, as in Bilbao, it would lift attendance at other cultural institutions.After the vote, Mr. Armstrong said he was disappointed.\u201cI suppose that it was a reaction to a sense of engulfing internationalism, or a reaction against globalism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m explaining it to myself.\u201dMr. Armstrong said that he was surprised by the depth of the resistance and that he and the Guggenheim would now speak to the Finnish supporters of the project to see if there was any interest in pursuing it further.\u201cBut I think it\u2019s unlikely that there would be any further activity,\u201d he said.The Guggenheim Helsinki project has been the subject of intense scrutiny since plans were unveiled in 2011. Opposition has come from both the populist far right and members of the left and Social Democrats, for different reasons. All seemed to agree that public funding should not be spent on a private institution, especially when the government is enforcing austerity measures to help the economy rebound from an economic downturn.Also voiced was a sense that the proposed museum represented an outside cultural influence, not a homegrown product of Finnish cultural sensibilities.\u201cI\u2019m exhausted but relieved,\u201d said Osku Pajamaki, a City Council member who was a leading opponent of the Guggenheim proposal. \u201cInstead of buying a subsidiary of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, we can now focus on creating unique local cultural attractions in Helsinki.\u201dSupport for the project had come from conservative and center parties, with significant interest from Finnish business groups, said Ari Lahti, an investment banker and chairman of the Guggenheim Helsinki Supporting Foundation.The foundation had raised $36 million from private and corporate donors for the plan, Mr. Lahti said. Of that total, $16 million was to have gone toward building the museum and $20 million to pay the license fee to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York for use of the Guggenheim name and \u201caccess to the Guggenheim\u2019s knowledge and expertise, collections, international network of museums and communications channels,\u201d according to the New York museum.\u201cWe have received donations, with no strings attached, from the hotels in Finland; restaurants in Helsinki; Finnair, the national airline company; the three big ferry companies that operate in Helsinki,\u201d Mr. Lahti said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting support from people who see this as a good investment for Finland economically and from people who love art. All the big museum leaders are in favor of the museum.\u201dThe museum was to have been built according to a design by the Paris-based architectural firm Moreau Kusunoki, which had won an international design competition. Its horizontal campus of ascending linked pavilions, said Nicolas Moreau, a partner in the firm, \u201cis based on a design concept of openness, flexibility,\u201d allowing curators to configure exhibition space in a variety of ways.Along with exhibitions of artworks on loan from the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the museum was to have included work by local artists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fiercely Debated Water Level Plan Is Adopted for Lake Ontario", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 An international commission on Thursday gave its final approval to a pact that will regulate the water level and it hopes repair the ecosystems of Lake Ontario.The plan modernizes those decades-old controls, allowing more fluctuation in lake heights and dips, something supporters say is necessary to restore vulnerable wildlife and habitat that have been damaged by an artificial placidity in the lake.But opponents of Plan 2014 have feared that the new protocols, setting higher highs and lower lows, could devastate coastal towns with severe floods or inflict costly flood-prevention measures on communities that cannot afford them. They also questioned how a more volatile lake might affect property values and taxes.In the end, however, the International Joint Commission \u2014 comprising Canadian and American officials \u2014 decided in favor of the new control levels. Lana Pollack, the top United States representative to the commission, said the plan would \u201crestore the health and diversity of coastal wetlands, perform better under changing climate conditions and continue to protect against extreme high and low water levels.\u201d\u201cIf the International Joint Commission thinks for a second that Plan 2014 will ever be fully implemented, they are sorely mistaken,\u201d Mr. Collins said in a statement, calling the plan a \u201cbureaucratic disaster.\u201dThe plan did not so much inspire partisan divides, but rather regional ones, with some communities on the lake\u2019s southern shore opposing the plan and those along the St. Lawrence and eastern coast championing it.On Friday, New York State officials said they would work to carry out programs and continue to consult on \u201cunanticipated flood risks, navigation constraints and other critical issues.\u201d And ask for financial help, they said.\u201cWe ask that the U.S. government provide funding sufficient to assist New York communities in adapting to this internationally designed plan,\u201d read a joint statement from the departments of State and Environmental Conservation.The plan was the result of more than a decade of scientific study, as well as another unsuccessful idea known as Plan 2007. Several major environmental groups, including the Nature Conservancy, lobbied for the 2014 version, arguing that allowing the natural rhythms of nature would help heal tens of thousands of acres of damaged wetlands, including vulnerable bird, fish and small mammal habitats.Supporters also argued that the restoration of the wetlands could help protect coastal communities from surges from hurricanes and other storms intensified by climate change.Lee Willbanks, the executive director of Save the River of Clayton, N.Y., said he expected that the changes would help encourage wildlife restoration as well as recreational boating, angling and other tourism. \u201cOur economies are beginning to recognize and depend on a healthy river,\u201d Mr. Willbanks said, noting the draw of northern pike and muskie. \u201cThe environment and the economy are so intertwined.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Hone a New Message: It\u2019s the Economy, Everyone", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a blunt, plain-spoken set of senators who gathered last Monday at the Washington home of Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, dining on Chinese food as they vented frustration about the missteps of the Democratic Party.To this decidedly centrist group, the 2016 election was nothing short of a fiasco: final proof that its national party had grown indifferent to the rural, more conservative areas represented by Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana, who attended the dinner. All face difficult re-election races in 2018.The party, these senators said, had grown overly fixated on cultural issues with limited appeal to the heartland. They criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cStronger Together,\u201d as flat and opaque, according to multiple people present at the dinner, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.Most of all, they lamented, Democrats had simply failed to offer a clarion message about the economy with appeal to all 50 states.\u201cWhy did the working people, who have always been our base, turn away?\u201d Mr. Manchin said in an interview, recounting the tenor of the dinner conversation.Moderate Democrats are not alone in their sense of urgency about honing a new economic message. After a stinging loss to Donald J. Trump, liberals in the party are also trying to figure out how to tap into the populist unrest that convulsed both parties in 2016. Only by making pocketbook issues the central focus, they say, can Democrats recover in the 2018 midterm elections and unseat Mr. Trump in 2020.\u201cWe need to double down and double down again on the importance of building an economy not just for those at the top, but for everyone,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a high-profile progressive who is seen as a leading potential opponent for Mr. Trump.This pocketbook-centered approach offers an added benefit in the minds of Democratic strategists: It papers over the party\u2019s differences on how much to focus on cultural issues.There is little appetite among most Democrats to substantively revise their stances on issues like abortion, gay rights, gun control and immigration, where trends on the national level continue to favor the party. By constructing a platform focused on an overarching theme of economic fairness, Democrats are hoping to avoid yoking their candidates to a more divisive agenda that could sink them in states like North Dakota and West Virginia, which are crucial to control of the Senate.This is markedly different from the approach that party leaders have taken over the last eight years, when President Obama defined the party from top to bottom with his personality and policies. Instead, Democrats intend to focus on a sparer agenda of bread-and-butter priorities that can win support from both liberal and moderate officeholders \u2014 and appeal to voters just as much in red states as along the two coasts.Beyond that, they expect wide variance in how officeholders handle Mr. Trump and his agenda, from moderates who seek out accommodation to blue-state leaders who pursue total war. Their emerging message is likely to focus on protecting Medicare and Social Security, attacking income inequality and political corruption, and blocking legislation that might restrict access to health care.With the country growing more urban and racially diverse, Democrats like their chances in the 2020 presidential race, when nonwhite voters are likely to make up more than 30 percent of the electorate for the first time in history. Even in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat, the country\u2019s changing hue helped her come closer than any Democrat in decades to flipping Arizona and Georgia, two traditional Republican bastions.But before the next presidential race, Democrats must navigate a treacherous landscape of midterm elections. They must defend 10 Senate seats in states Mr. Trump won, many of them in the Rust Belt and the West. And unless they break the Republican lock on state governments by winning governorships in a handful of big states, like Wisconsin and Ohio, they may be unable to prevent Republicans from continuing to draw congressional maps that favor their candidates.Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a new member of the Democratic leadership team in the House, said he considered Mr. Trump an \u201cElectoral College president\u201d and cautioned Democrats not to overreact to his victory. But Mr. Jeffries agreed that Democrats must court \u201cblue-collar voters we lost, without abandoning our core constituencies and principles that made up the Obama coalition.\u201d\u2019\u201cWe will not take back the majority,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said, \u201cunless we have a big-tent approach.\u201dAt a meeting of House Democrats this past week, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the party did not have to move away from its liberal values or cease to be a party that \u201cwelcomes those who seem to have been left behind for a long time,\u201d said Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan, who paraphrased Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks.But Mr. Biden encouraged Democrats to represent themselves as a \u201cparty of working people.\u201d Mr. Kildee, who is weighing a bid for governor in 2018, said they would have to reorganize their message around issues that are \u201cfundamental to economic security,\u201d and await opportunities to exploit Mr. Trump\u2019s shortcomings.Evidence of a narrower, more tightly focused Democratic agenda was on display this past week at a Capitol Hill news conference, where a range of Democrats spoke beside scrubs-clad nurses and older voters holding up signs that read: \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to privatize.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic Senate leader, warned gravely that Republicans were \u201cgearing up for a war on seniors.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, echoing the economic themes that propelled his White House bid and first drew Democratic attention to the potency of populism this year, vowed, \u201cWe are not going to allow the billionaire class or Trump or anybody else to cut the programs that the elderly, the disabled and disabled vets absolutely depend upon.\u201dThis effort to defend popular government programs appeals to all elements of the party and offers the promise of winning back some of the older white voters it has lost in recent elections. And it recalls the strategy Democrats turned to the last time they were trying to reclaim control of Congress when Republicans had full control of the government, and the left was united in opposition to President George W. Bush\u2019s attempted Social Security overhaul.Still, the Democrats\u2019 fortunes may rest chiefly with Mr. Trump. If he shuns the lawmakers in his own party who want to overhaul entitlements such as Medicare and governs more as a populist than as a free-market conservative, it could complicate the Democratic comeback strategy.Outside Washington, some party leaders plan on taking the fight to Mr. Trump more immediately. Progressives in blue-state capitals appear primed to take a more combative approach, attacking Mr. Trump and obstructing him on issues important to liberal voters.These Democrats have already pledged to put up a front of resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, much as Republican governors and attorneys general did against Mr. Obama. Representative Xavier Becerra, who has been appointed the new attorney general of California, said leaders in the states would hold the line on policy where Democrats in Washington could not.\u201cOur role will principally be to defend the progress we have made in recent years,\u201d Mr. Becerra said.At a retreat for Democratic governors in New Orleans last weekend, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington argued forcefully that governors should send a message to the White House on health care, among other issues.\u201cThere is so much threatened in my state,\u201d Mr. Inslee said in an interview. \u201cWe will be engaged vigorously in making sure that the public understands what\u2019s going on and how damaging it can be.\u201dBut even liberals believe Democrats must work harder to compete for voters who lean to the right, if only to shave a few points off the Republican Party\u2019s margin of victory in rural America. In some cases, they said, that may mean embracing candidates who hold wildly different views from the national party on certain core priorities.Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, said Democrats did not have to choose between supporting liberal policies and competing for conservative votes. But he seemed to imply that Democrats had made a mistake in 2016 by not working harder to win over skeptical voters.\u201cIn the presidential race, where there\u2019s just a much bigger playing field, there\u2019s a tendency to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m only going to get 35 percent, so I\u2019m not going to go there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cWell, the difference between 35 and 25 is big.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Treasury May Mean Independence for Fannie and Freddie", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byFair GameSteven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Treasury Department, electrified Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders on Wednesday when he signaled that the mortgage finance giants would finally be allowed to get out from under Washington\u2019s thumb.\u201cWe got to get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership,\u201d he told Fox Business. \u201cIt makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have.\u201dMr. Mnuchin is right. It has been more than eight years since the federal government took over Fannie and Freddie in the mortgage crisis; as such, they are the last big piece of unfinished business from that era.When the government changed the terms of their bailouts in the summer of 2012 and began expropriating all of Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s profits every quarter, it seemed as if that unsatisfactory setup would go on forever. After all, it is hard for the government to give up a honey pot that has returned over $60 billion more to the Treasury than the companies received from taxpayers during their troubles.Granted, Mr. Mnuchin said little about how the administration thinks the nation\u2019s biggest \u201cgovernment-sponsored enterprises\u201d should be structured. That is not surprising, given the complexity of the $6 trillion mortgage market.So why did Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s comments jazz the markets? Because they revealed a seismic shift in the way these companies are viewed by the new administration. In place of the strident, anti-G.S.E. ideology that has dominated the conversation on both the left and the right since the bailout, it looks as if a more pragmatic and positive approach to the companies and their role in the mortgage market is on the way.What that means, in my view, is that the enterprises may be allowed to live a new day rather than continue to be diminished and drained of their profits.This is good news indeed for small lenders who rely so heavily on Fannie and Freddie to buy the mortgages they underwrite, freeing them to repeat the process rather than hold the loans on their balance sheets. And when small lenders benefit, borrowers do, too, by having more choices.\u201cSince 2012, we\u2019ve been advocating for the G.S.E.s to be reformed, recapitalized and then released from conservatorship,\u201d Mr. Corso said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that is the direction the Trump administration will head in.\u201dAlthough there was not much talk of Fannie and Freddie on the campaign trail, it was widely assumed that a Clinton administration would embrace some of those Obama housing officials as well as their ideas.That those officials now have little sway is one reason shares in Fannie and Freddie soared in value just after the election and even before Mr. Mnuchin spoke about the companies.As a former head of the mortgage-backed securities desk at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin well understands the mechanics of this enormous market. He also recognizes the significant role a well-capitalized Fannie and Freddie could play in ensuring that borrowers have access to mortgage money in good economies as well as bad.So what might happen now? In his comments, Mr. Mnuchin nodded to a crucial issue regarding Fannie and Freddie: safety and soundness. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that when they\u2019re restructured, they\u2019re absolutely safe and they don\u2019t get taken over again,\u201d he said, \u201cBut we got to get them out of government control.\u201dThis is clearly untenable and unsafe for taxpayers, who would again be on the hook if Fannie and Freddie began losing money.An easy way to let them rebuild capital would be to end the quarterly transfer of all their profits to the Treasury. This would not require legislation; it could be done administratively with incoming Treasury officials advising the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, to change the terms of the government\u2019s agreement with the companies. This was supposed to happen anyway while the companies were operating under the conservatorship.What of the fears that if they are allowed to recapitalize, the companies will return to their swaggering, prebailout ways and grow powerful and reckless as they did in the 1990s?Mr. Corso and others say safeguards are in place to protect taxpayers from such an outcome.\u201cWe would be the first to acknowledge that there were serious deficiencies in the way the G.S.E.s operated, pre-2008,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot have been addressed in the conservatorship.\u201dSimply recapitalizing the companies will also be cleaner, preventing potential self-dealing and the giveaways of the companies\u2019 assets that existed in some of the privatization proposals.There is another intriguing aspect to the Trump administration\u2019s shift, and it has to do with the lawsuits that have been filed against the government. One such suit was brought by Fairholme Funds, a mutual fund company that owns Fannie and Freddie shares. It contends that the 2012 profit sweep was an improper taking of private property without just compensation.Margaret Sweeney, the judge hearing the matter in the Court of Federal Claims, recently opened the door a crack, letting some documents see the light of day. Some of the materials cast doubt on arguments made by the government\u2019s lawyers that the profit sweep came about because Fannie and Freddie were in dire condition and the taxpayers needed protection from future losses.If Judge Sweeney were to order the release of more documents, the current administration would probably appeal. It is not as clear that a Trump administration would do so, however. This opens the possibility that all those materials that the Obama administration has fought so hard to keep secret might just emerge.That would be a huge service for anyone interested in holding government officials accountable for their actions.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Struggles to Shed Its Image as a Magnet for Shady Deals", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byIn August of last year, Panama sought to shed its image as a magnet for shady deals and narco traffickers by paying at least $2 million to host the world\u2019s largest anticorruption conference, now taking place in Panama City.At the time, it seemed like good idea.After the leak, involving millions of legal documents, the president, Juan Carlos Varela, appointed a seven-member commission in April to recommend how to make its financial sector more transparent. That did not work out exactly as planned, either.For credibility, the president had included Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist and a fierce critic of tax havens \u2014 onshore and offshore \u2014 which he views as the dark side of globalization. What happened next should surprise no one familiar with Panamanian politics or the resolve of Mr. Stiglitz.The commission, if not dead on arrival, quickly ended up on life support. Mr. Stiglitz and another board member, Mark Pieth, a Swiss anticorruption expert, resigned after only one official meeting because the government, they said, would not promise to make their final report public.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a committee on transparency and not be transparent,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said.The repercussions of this contretemps continued in the months leading up to the anticorruption conference. Each faction issued its own report. A prominent Panamanian lawyer publicly chastised professors at Columbia University, where Mr. Stiglitz teaches, for using the words \u201cPanama Papers\u201d in a course title, saying it unfairly singled out his country. And at the university\u2019s World Leaders Forum in September, Mr. Stiglitz gently confronted Panama\u2019s vice president for rendering what he said was an inaccurate account of why the commission had broken apart.With the world\u2019s economic powers intensifying their attack on tax havens, the commission\u2019s failure to speak in one voice illustrates the difficulty of trying to reform a financial system, particularly in a small country where familial ties run deep and the financial interests of elite lawyers and bankers are embedded in offshore businesses.Panama has taken some steps toward transparency. After initially balking, Panama did agree this year to a multilateral deal to provide the names of the real owners of offshore companies when other countries request them. And President Varela spoke at the opening ceremony of the anticorruption conference.But more needs to be done, said Mr. Stiglitz, a former co-chairman of the committee. He and Mr. Pieth said they were not bitter, but rued Panama\u2019s lost opportunity to serve as a model for other nations \u2014 including the United States \u2014 that do not fully comply with international standards of transparency.Other commission members blamed internal conflicts, not the government, for resignations. \u201cAll institutions have been open and willing to share information, documents and even opinions,\u201d Roberto Artavia Loria, a commission member, wrote in an email to Mr. StiglitzEven so, an examination by The New York Times of the business connections of the four Panamanian commission members \u2014 the fifth was Costa Rican \u2014 points to the challenges that Mr. Stiglitz and Mr. Pieth had to overcome.One member, Nicol\u00e1s Ardito Barletta, a former president of Panama under a dictatorship, helped to create the country\u2019s offshore industry in the 1970s as minister of planning. Mr. Barletta also championed the country\u2019s free-trade zone, a prime target of Mr. Stiglitz, who views lightly regulated, tax-advantaged zones as an invitation to money laundering.A second member, Gisela Porras, was once a partner in a law firm that recently advertised: \u201cOur corporate law is attractive for many reasons. First of all, shareholder information is not filed at the Public Registry, therefore granting confidentiality to beneficial owners.\u201dThe commission\u2019s other co-chairman, Alberto Alem\u00e1n, is an independent director of Global Bank, one of three Panamanian banks whose outlook was recently revised by S & P Global to negative from stable, reflecting \u201cshortfalls in regulation, supervision, governance and transparency in the Panamanian financial system.\u201dAfter a Spanish-led consortium won the right to build locks for bigger ships at a rock-bottom price, internal arguments soon gave way to larger problems.President Varela is also closely tied to law firms that handle offshore accounts. One Alem\u00e1n cousin is now his chief of staff, and both his vice minister of foreign affairs and the minister of economy and finance came from the Morgan & Morgan Group, which includes a law firm known for its offshore business. And one of the president\u2019s closest advisers until early this year was Ramon Fonseca Mora, a partner in Mossack Fonseca, the law firm that generated the Panama Papers. The German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung obtained the data and later shared it with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a nonprofit group based in Washington.Mr. Stiglitz initially wondered whether the government was serious about his appointment, but he said two things had convinced him that it was. Panama\u2019s vice president, Isabel de Saint Malo, flew to New York to personally ask Mr. Stiglitz to join, and Mr. Pieth was also asked to serve.The group met officially for the first time in June in New York. The honeymoon did not last long.\u201cEveryone was guilty of bad Googling,\u201d said one person who knew the commission members. Mr. Pieth added, \u201cWe didn\u2019t spend an awful amount of time on due diligence on our colleagues.\u201dPotential conflicts quickly became apparent, according to notes taken by an attendee. One member expressed concern about damage control, since the expanded canal was about to open \u2014 a moment of great national pride \u2014 and, the member said, \u201cwe will use that moment to say this is who we are and where our future is headed.\u201d When the subject of a public registry of beneficial owners was raised, Mr. Stiglitz said, \u201cyou could see them blanch.\u201d And, he added, there was no serious discussion about closer monitoring of tax-advantaged, free-trade zones, or the strong enforcement of the open-records law.The group agreed that it should secure a promise from President Varela that its final report would be made public. \u201cThey said they would go to the government and get it, and they never did,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said.Instead, on July 29, the group received a stern note from the government, saying that the presidential decree establishing the commission stipulated that the report \u201cwill be the property of and used by the Republic of Panama\u201d and that it would decide what to share with the public. The government also said funds requested for operational expenses would not be coming.Compounding matters, Mr. Stiglitz and Mr. Pieth said they had been shocked to learn, other members had surreptitiously sent an \u201cinterim\u201d report to President Varela without their knowledge or approval. That report, Mr. Stiglitz said, was too narrow and poorly written.Mr. Pieth wrote his own stinging response. \u201cI cannot help feeling that the president asked you to participate in the committee exactly for what you have done: to pull the emergency brakes when matters seemed to get tight for the Panamanian services industry.\u201dAround that time, Mr. Alem\u00e1n, the co-chairman, visited Mr. Stiglitz in New York to tell him that the commission should disband.The rump commission recently filed a final report, which Mr. Stiglitz said was not substantively different from the interim report. \u201cThey\u2019re making a valiant effort to sound tough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the key weaknesses in the transparency framework have not been addressed.\u201d He emphasized the importance of making all the names of beneficial owners public. \u201cWe are very big on the notion of a searchable registry, and they are very opposed to that,\u201d he said.Recent corruption investigations underscore their concern.This year, United States officials publicly identified Nidal Waked and Abdul Waked and their associates as running a major money-laundering ring that allegedly helped drug traffickers hide illicit profits in dozens of shell companies and a Panamanian bank. Both men, who dispute the allegations, have long had a power base in the Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone, which is next to the Panama Canal.In a statement, the United States Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control said that by publicly identifying this ring and freezing the ring\u2019s assets under United States control, it had disrupted the group\u2019s ability \u201cto launder drug-trafficking proceeds using trade-based methods, duty-free retail, real estate development and financial services throughout the region.\u201dIn an unrelated investigation that has rocked Brazil\u2019s political establishment, prosecutors there said they had the Panama Papers law firm, Mossack Fonseca, in their sights. \u201cIt is clear to us that there were at least two crimes committed by Mossack Fonseca\u2019s office in Brazil \u2014 financial crime and organized crime,\u201d said Jerusa Burmann Viecili, a Brazilian federal prosecutor.She added: \u201cMossack Fonseca\u2019s registering of offshores had an objective that was quite clear \u2014 to hide the truthful beneficiaries of these shell companies.\u201dMossack Fonseca said its Brazil affiliate, or franchise, operated independently of the main office.Brazil\u2019s investigation, called Operation Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash, has also alleged that workers of the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, one of the largest in Latin America \u2014 and one of Panama\u2019s public-works contractors \u2014 used shell companies to cover its tracks in a bribe-paying scheme.Panamanian banks are alleged to have held some of the bribe money. Multibank, formerly known as Multi-Credit Bank, is cited in court documents as one of the places where funds were deposited. This financial institution\u2019s outlook was recently revised downward by S & P Global.An article on Dec. 4 about anti-corruption efforts in Panama referred incorrectly to leaked documents known as the \u201cPanama Papers.\u201d They were obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, not the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Trump Speak for Workers", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed Contributor\u201cI am your voice,\u201d President-elect Donald J. Trump declared at the Republican National Convention. In another campaign speech, he told his supporters, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201dBefore he has even taken office, Mr. Trump has tried that go-it-alone strategy on behalf of American workers. He has browbeaten Carrier into reversing a decision to move some jobs from Indiana to Mexico, and he attempted \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to do the same with Rexnord, which owns a neighboring manufacturing plant. But publicity stunts and Twitter rants are no substitute for a comprehensive, coherent economic strategy that invests in America and lifts up the voices and the power of working people.Working people do not want a savior to speak for us. We want to raise our own voices through our unions \u2014 and those voices are more essential than ever. The share of income going to the middle class has fallen in almost perfect correlation with the declining percentage of people working in jobs where they enjoy a union. Collective, democratic representation in the workplace is essential to shared and durable economic prosperity.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s emerging cabinet and policy pronouncements seem to treat actual working people as bottom lines rather than human beings, our unions as a threat rather than a partner, and rising wages as a problem rather than the foundation of our prosperity.If Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy to keep jobs in America relies on busting unions, keeping wages down, deregulating everything in sight and cutting taxes for the wealthy, he\u2019ll certainly fail, and in the process he\u2019ll undermine the foundations of American democracy.The Carrier jobs are good because those workers have a voice through their union and have bargained to share in the profit derived from producing relatively high-value consumer goods for American markets. When manufacturing workers have a union to make their voices heard, the jobs pay better and typically provide decent health and retirement benefits. These careers breathe life into local economies: Suppliers, service providers and public sector jobs around Carrier and Rexnord would not exist but for those plants.But union jobs are about more than economics. Through their union, the United Steelworkers, Carrier and Rexnord workers have a say in what happens at their workplace and in the nation. They are connected to one another and to the larger community where they live. Jobs where working people have a say are critical to the fabric of our democracy.The United States can\u2019t win a global race to the bottom, and we shouldn\u2019t be trying to. Instead, the path to success for a wealthy, industrialized country like the United States lies in strategic investments in infrastructure and skills, and trade and tax policies that nurture and reward domestic production \u2014 not outsourcing.When democratic capitalism is managed in ways that fail to provide good jobs, working people will turn in desperation toward authoritarian solutions. This is the great lesson of the 20th century, and we face the threat once again today. In industrialized countries all over the world, working people have come to believe that the institutions of liberal democracy have failed to protect them against the ravages of globalization. The leaders who exploit those very real anxieties are interested in power, not helping working people.To avoid that same turn, the United States needs a coordinated suite of public policies that preserve, nurture and create good jobs. And we need a president who sees workers as partners to be engaged, not as subjects to be manipulated. The workers at Carrier and Rexnord have elected representatives and are part of a union with real experience partnering with employers to save jobs. But Mr. Trump refused to engage with the steelworkers\u2019 union; instead, he insulted the local president, who started working at the Rexnord plant at age 17.If President-elect Trump is serious about building a high-productivity, high-wage economy, he needs to put a moratorium on flawed trade agreements and crack down on unfair trade practices, and he must work to end all tax subsidies for offshoring and put those and other revenues toward funding quality education, skills and infrastructure investment. The American labor movement has long advocated for these policies.The next time Mr. Trump wants to save good jobs, he should listen to the people whose jobs he is trying to save. Without unions to amplify those voices, we cannot create good jobs on the scale that is needed \u2014 or preserve our democracy.Richard Trumka is the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Advertisement"}

Another Syrian family of refugees will be arriving soon, and this empty, echoing old place needs to be readied in welcome.The word has trickled down from the State Department\u2019s refugee resettlement program. A mother, a father, his brother and four children, the youngest just 10. Muslims, traveling from Turkey. Flying into New York in the next few days.Their imminent arrival explains all the commotion inside this slate-colored house in the small city of Lancaster, in south-central Pennsylvania. The state may have gone to Donald J. Trump, who likened the Syrian resettlement program to a \u201ca great Trojan horse\u201d for terrorists. But he isn\u2019t president yet.That is why volunteers and staff members from the Church World Service, a nationwide nonprofit that helps the government take in refugees fleeing violence and persecution, are cleaning cabinets, carting furniture and doing their best to make things homey. Just not too homey.\u201cDoing too much can make a family feel like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s home,\u201d says Josh Digrugilliers, 26, the group\u2019s local housing specialist, whose crowded key chain jangles in reminder of all the refugees in need.He scours a government checklist of housing requirements for a resettlement, mindful that whatever he spends is deducted from a refugee\u2019s one-time government grant of no more than $1,125. A family\u2019s combined grants must cover its rent and other expenses until the nonprofit has helped the adults acquire Social Security numbers and jobs.The used furniture being trundled in reflects the emphasis on economy. Some comes from the donations hoarded in a cluttered garage, where a \u201cWelcome Home\u201d sign in Arabic is on display. Other items were acquired cheap \u2014 chairs for $5, tables for $20 \u2014 at Root\u2019s Old Mill Flea Market.New paint and flooring give the house the smell of a fresh start, thanks to the landlord, John Liang, who came to Lancaster as a child, one of the \u201cboat people\u201d who fled Vietnam on dangerously overcrowded vessels after the war. He spent a year in a notoriously hellish refugee camp before coming to Lancaster, where he and his family delivered newspapers, shoveled snow, did sewing and assembly-line work. Anything.Now 45, Mr. Liang works overtime at a nearby Kellogg\u2019s cereal plant and manages several properties he owns, including this house, which he wants to be \u2014 just so.\u201cThere are other people living a lot harder, tougher, than what I went through,\u201d he says.Mr. Digrugilliers applies his checklist to the kitchen, where the counter is crowded with mismatched dinnerware, new appliances and clutches of flatware bound with rubber bands. Draped over the oven handle is a dish towel printed with a calendar for 1968, another tumultuous year.Then to the bedrooms upstairs. The children\u2019s twin beds, bought at discount from the Lancaster Mattress Company, are covered with the black G of the Georgia Bulldogs, the winged wheel of the Detroit Red Wings and other invitations to sleep in cocoons of American culture.Armed with a list of what he needs, he and a colleague, Orion Hernandez, climb into a beat-up van reeking of McDonald\u2019s. They head to Walmart, where Mr. Digrugilliers recognizes a thin man \u2014 a Nepalese refugee who resettled here two years ago \u2014 leaving as he is walking in.\u201cHey, how are you?\u201d Mr. Digrugilliers calls out. \u201cHello,\u201d the man calls back.Such encounters happen often in Lancaster, whose rich history of acceptance is rooted, in part, in the influence of the Mennonites, Amish and other faiths. A glimpse of the local worldview came in January when a supportive rally of more than 200 people drowned out a much smaller anti-immigrant protest outside the Church World Service office here.Sheila Mastropietro, the group\u2019s longtime supervisor in Lancaster, took heart in the moment. It reflected a communal understanding of both the global refugee crisis and the rigorous screening process that refugees undergo before coming to the United States.Still, given a president-elect who seems averse to the country\u2019s modest commitment to refugee relocation, Ms. Mastropietro says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201dLast fiscal year, the Lancaster office of the Church World Service helped to resettle 407 of the 85,000 refugees admitted to this country; this fiscal year, its target is 550 of a hoped-for 110,000.\u201cWe are acting as if the numbers are going to be the same \u2014 until we hear something different,\u201d she says.Decades of resettlement work have transformed the Lancaster area into a medley of cultures so rich that Amer Alfayadh, 34, a senior case manager, struggles to name them all: \u201cSyrians, Iraqis, Somalis, Congolese, Ukrainians, Belorussians, people from Kazakhstan. Then, of course, Lebanese, Palestinians. Bhutanese, Nepalese, Burmese, Sri Lankans \u2026\u201dMr. Alfayadh himself arrived from Iraq in 2010. Though trained as an engineer, he worked at a Lowe\u2019s \u2014 customer service, paint, lawn and garden \u2014 and as a substitute teacher before being hired to help other refugees. He is accustomed now to urgent late-night calls from fresh arrivals unfamiliar with, say, locks on doors.New clients are often at their breaking point, uncertain what to make of this exotic land called Pennsylvania. Knowing how difficult it can be for anyone in crisis to see ahead \u2014 to jobs, school, a future \u2014 Mr. Alfayadh says he tries to impart a simple message:\u201cO.K. Tomorrow will be better.\u201dAt Walmart, Mr. Digrugilliers and Mr. Hernandez commandeer two shopping carts each and begin racing through the cavernous store like contestants on the old \u201cSupermarket Sweep\u201d game show, grabbing specific items, down to umbrellas and sanitary pads.His purchases complete, Mr. Digrugilliers mounts his cart and wheels it into the dusk like a skateboard, exuberant with hope that some refugee family\u2019s journey will be just as smooth.It is not. The Church World Service soon receives word that this particular family\u2019s resettlement has been delayed \u2014 a not-uncommon development that could be caused by something as simple as a spike in an asylum-seeker\u2019s blood pressure at the airport.But there is no shortage of tempest-tossed refugees. Mr. Alfayadh\u2019s supervisor, Valentina Ross, remembers that another Syrian family is arriving in a few days: a father, a mother, three daughters and a boy. They will need a home.Today is the day. A holiday spirit has taken hold in downtown Lancaster, with a colossal Christmas tree glittering in Penn Square and ancient brick houses swathed in festive lights.A mile away, a Church World Service caseworker named Gaby Garver, a focused college graduate of 22, is collecting provisions for the new family at a food pantry. Signing some paperwork, she says, \u201cAnd no meat products for the family, please.\u201dAs Ms. Garver prepares to leave with milk, vegetables and other items, a pantry volunteer asks: \u201cSince you didn\u2019t take any meat, would you like some extra rice?\u201dYes, please.More food is needed. Ms. Garver guides her 1999 Pontiac through the cold rain to the Save-A-Lot supermarket, where many goods sit in cut-open cardboard cases. She leaves 10 minutes later with bread, fruit, beans, sugar, tea and a receipt for $26.58, to be deducted from the family\u2019s grant money.Hunched against the weather, the slight young woman makes two trips carrying the food into the drab gray house. After stocking the refrigerator and cabinet, she conducts a last-minute inspection. The fridge is cold. The tap has hot water. The burners on the gas stove ignite.Everything upstairs is fine as well, with even more homey touches added. New pajamas and towels. New clothes hangers. New picture frames, showing stock photos of cheerful families, on the shelves. And on one twin bed, a child\u2019s soccer ball, still in its box.The rain has stopped, a slice of moon risen. Ms. Garver is driving now to the home of a Syrian family that arrived seven months ago. The mother has cooked a hot meal for the refugee family that is about to land any minute in New York, a good three-hour drive away.Inside, where five young children zip and waddle about, the prepared meal sits in expectation on the dining-room table: a large aluminum tray bountiful with chicken and rice and a huge bowl of salad.The oldest child, Mohamad, 14, helps Ms. Garver carry the food out to her vehicle, and she thanks him. He responds with the formality given to a new language being tried on for size.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the boy says, and smiles.Returning to the gray house, Ms. Garver fumbles in the dark to open the door while holding the tray of still-hot food. When she returns with the salad bowl, she stoops to collect a clump of junk mail, including a come-on addressed to \u201cOur Neighbor.\u201dLater tonight, Ms. Garver and Mr. Alfayadh will drive a Ford van to Lancaster Airport, where they will meet two representatives from the local Islamic Center. Soon after, another van will arrive from Kennedy International Airport.Hugs and handshakes will be exchanged in the December air. Luggage will be collected. And six Syrian refugees will be driven the 20 minutes to a warm home perfumed by warm food, in a city made radiant by the multicolored lights of the season.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of an employee of the Church World Service.

{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Currency Madness", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byEditorialPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela made a baffling announcement on Dec. 11, saying that his government intended to yank the 100 bol\u00edvar note from circulation in three days to thwart a supposed plot to hoard Venezuelan currency abroad. Any 100 bol\u00edvar bills that were not exchanged at the central bank within 10 days would become worthless. The result of this reckless decision was predictable.Shops and merchants stopped accepting the note, all but paralyzing an economy wrecked by years of abysmal mismanagement. Looting and riots erupted in several cities.That is ludicrous. The unrest and violence in Venezuela are entirely the doing of the Maduro government, which has spent years suppressing the opposition and imposing arbitrary currency controls that have made a once prosperous economy one of the world\u2019s most dysfunctional. The Obama administration has sought in recent months to nudge the government and opposition factions to find collaborative solutions to the country\u2019s ills and offered to help with delivery of humanitarian aid. The collapse of order in Venezuela could set off a refugee crisis that would destabilize the region.So far, international efforts to get the government to accept humanitarian aid and negotiate in good faith with the opposition have faltered. This summer, opposition leaders, who control the National Assembly, thought they had a good shot at ousting Mr. Maduro by holding a recall referendum. That initiative fizzled as Maduro loyalists in the government made it impossible for opposition factions, which are deeply divided, to meet the procedural requirements necessary to hold an early vote.In coming weeks, the Trump administration will have to assess Venezuela\u2019s worsening crisis and take stock of its policy options. Late in the presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged to \u201cstand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.\u201d He offered no details of what that would entail. One thing is certain: He should avoid getting drawn into a war of words with Mr. Maduro. Venezuela\u2019s flailing leader would happily use any excuse to claim foreign intervention to justify even greater repression of his people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As President Joseph Kabila Digs In, Tensions Rise in Congo", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byKINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 In a mansion along the Congo River, with a collection of expensive watches, expensive motorcycles and a chimpanzee in a cage, Joseph Kabila, the president of this vast and troubled country, should be packing up.Instead, he is digging in.His second term is up in a few days, the Constitution forbids him to run for a third, millions of people are threatening to mobilize against him, and still Mr. Kabila shows no signs of leaving.The Democratic Republic of Congo is already one of the poorest, most volatile nations on earth. Countless young people are out of work, and the security forces are brutal and loosely controlled. Add to that dozens of armed groups operating in the hinterlands.Many people here are terrified that if Mr. Kabila clings to power at all costs, as some of his counterparts across Africa recently have, Congo could explode.But the paradox is that Mr. Kabila may not especially want to stay in power. Instead, former confidants say, he refuses to give up for a simple reason: He is afraid \u2014 for his family, for his safety and, not insignificant, for his wealth.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an exit plan,\u201d said Martin Fayulu, an opposition politician.It is an old problem with a new twist.According to forensic investigators, mining executives and officials in his own government, Mr. Kabila has looted millions of dollars in public assets.Recent troves of documents shared with The New York Times \u2014 whose authenticity has been verified by current and former Congolese officials \u2014 reveal a string of suspicious bank transfers totaling $95.7 million, dubious mining rights sales that have generated millions more and possible money-laundering schemes involving a bank executive widely described as Mr. Kabila\u2019s adopted brother.Authoritarian leaders used to be able to steal with impunity. But today, a whistle-blower with an iPhone can be a dangerous foe. The post-Panama Papers, WikiLeaks world is an uncomfortable place for an autocrat.And cornered, he has begun to lash out.Mr. Kabila\u2019s forces and their supporters have arrested journalists, jailed opposition politicians, firebombed opposition headquarters and assassinated a Catholic priest who held workshops on the Constitution and its limit of a two-term presidency. Scores of anti-Kabila protesters have already been shot dead, turning more people against Mr. Kabila each day.Opposition leaders are now threatening to flood the streets with millions of protesters on Tuesday, the day Mr. Kabila is supposed to be out of office.Seeing chaos on the horizon, top Western officials have shuttled in and out of the capital, Kinshasa, trying to draw the reclusive Mr. Kabila out from his riverside residence, where he lives under heavy guard. This year, Secretary of State John Kerry and other high-level American officials have met with Mr. Kabila several times.But several people who know the president well said Mr. Kabila was increasingly isolated, moody and antisocial. They said he had been keeping irregular hours, becoming irritable with his staff members and staying up late to play Sony PlayStation 4 or race his fancy motorcycles up and down the dark boulevards of Kinshasa to blow off steam.As Mr. Kabila plays for time, the information on corruption keeps streaming in, from many directions.Other investigations are in the works, and the American government is trying to delicately warn Mr. Kabila that his chances of being prosecuted for corruption would be lower if he left now.\u201cNo one can guarantee no prosecution, but in the real world, there are priorities,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state. \u201cI don\u2019t think one of them would be going after the former president of Congo who did the right thing.\u201dStill, no one has come up with an exit plan. Even the Western diplomats tasked with appealing to Mr. Kabila, pleading with him not to drive his country off a cliff, admit they are at a loss for what to offer.And what about his safety? Mr. Kabila has made many enemies in nearly 16 years as the leader of one of the world\u2019s most violent states. As one mining executive who used to be close to Mr. Kabila argued, it is not as if the American government is going to assign SEAL Team 6 to guard him in perpetuity, even if he asks.Mr. Kabila is not your typical strongman. He was driving a taxicab in Tanzania not long before he was thrust into power. His father, a smuggler turned rebel leader turned president, was assassinated in 2001. The only person top advisers could agree on to lead the country, which was in the midst of a very confusing civil war, was the elder son, Joseph, at the time 29.Unlike Isaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea for the past 23 years, or Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (30 years), or Robert Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence (36 years), Mr. Kabila has never tried to build a cult of personality. He is shy, mild and a careful listener. Confidants say he never wanted to be president and tried to turn down the job.But over the years, former aides and investigators say, he has amassed a fortune and developed a taste for the finer things. A former colleague said he sometimes wore two expensive watches at the same time \u2014 a Rolex and a Patek Philippe \u2014 one for each wrist.Mr. Kabila and his family own a network of homes and huge farms across Congo, sweeping up thousands of acres, analysts and former aides said. They also said Mr. Kabila was most at peace around animals. He is an avid breeder of cows, and he kept a menagerie of chimpanzees, a dik-dik (a small antelope), birds of prey and parrots at his house in urban Kinshasa. A recent visitor said at least one chimp still lived there, screeching hoots from a cage as guests arrive.But these days, the stress of the job seems to be eating at him. Mr. Kabila has put on weight. The few times he was spotted in public he had huge bags under his eyes.More whistle-blowers are coming forward, which may make him even less likely to quit if he believes that he can best protect himself and his assets by intimidating or neutralizing critics with his security forces.One Congolese government official said that on numerous occasions he had been instructed to take wheeled suitcases, stuffed with $100 bills totaling more than $7 million, to a minister\u2019s office for \u201cstate\u2019s use.\u201d The money came from a government-controlled company. The official, along with several others, said it would be too dangerous for anyone but Mr. Kabila or his family to steal that blatantly.In the past two decades, Congo\u2019s wars over minerals, politics, ethnicity and land have killed millions, destabilizing a big chunk of the continent.But its history of ill-gotten gains goes back much further. Mobutu Sese Seko, Congo\u2019s strongman during the Cold War, was one of Africa\u2019s most notorious thieves, though back then it was easier to get away with corruption.None of the documents to emerge recently have Mr. Kabila\u2019s signature on them, though the names of top aides and companies of Mr. Kabila\u2019s associates are all over them.Lambert Mende, the chief government spokesman, said Mr. Kabila was \u201cnot a robber, not at all.\u201d\u201cHe has no account in Europe or the U.S.A.,\u201d Mr. Mende said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a single apartment outside of Congo. This is all storytelling.\u201dThe most suspicious documents to emerge recently include a string of bank transfers to different accounts at different banks with the notation that they were \u201cadvance tax payments\u201d from G\u00e9camines, a struggling state-controlled mining company, for Congo\u2019s central bank. Starting late last year, the transfers reveal anomalies like instructions that $8 million be withdrawn from the teller \u2014 in cash \u2014 on behalf of the central bank.\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d said a former employee of Congo\u2019s central bank who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he could be killed if he was identified. \u201cWe don\u2019t get cash from a commercial bank. We import our own cash. We have a service in Switzerland that does that.\u201dAnalysts at the Sentry, an investigative arm of the Enough Project, said that during the time of the supposed G\u00e9camines transfer of $95.7 million to the central bank, the central bank\u2019s foreign reserves actually dropped \u2014 to $1.17 billion from $1.47 billion \u2014 pushing up inflation and causing issues for Congo\u2019s economy. At the same time, Mr. Kabila\u2019s government drastically cut spending on health care and the few services it provides.Sentry analysts said they were curious how G\u00e9camines, a company with endless management problems, would have that much cash on hand for advance tax payments when thousands of employees had not been paid in months. Documents showed that G\u00e9camines lost $82.9 million in 2014. Mining executives said bigger, more profitable companies always paid much less in advance taxes.Some of the money apparently stolen in Congo may have moved through the American financial system, Sentry analysts say, and they are calling on the United States Treasury Department to take stronger measures to combat suspicious transactions from Congo.This past week, the Treasury Department sanctioned two Congolese officials close to Mr. Kabila, saying the officials were undermining democracy.Across Africa, term limits established years ago when democracy\u2019s brand was stronger have been systematically dismantled, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Burundi exploded last year when its president plowed ahead with his plan to stay in office for a contentious third term.In October, Mr. Kabila\u2019s aides struck a deal with a few second-tier opposition groups to delay the next presidential election until 2018 \u2014 the election was supposed to be held this year \u2014 but Congo\u2019s major opposition groups, representing tens of millions of frustrated people, rejected that. Opposition leaders said they would never accept Mr. Kabila\u2019s staying in office beyond Dec. 19.Congo\u2019s political opposition, unlike Burundi\u2019s, is not heavily armed. Most analysts say it would be difficult to overthrow Mr. Kabila. The security forces are still loyal to him, partly because he has made sure that soldiers and intelligence officers have been relatively well paid, no matter the dire straits of the national economy.In a recent meeting with delegates of the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Kabila remained characteristically cagey. According to a confidential United Nations report, he said that it was the \u201csovereign right of the Congolese people to decide in the next three or so years to amend the Constitution,\u201d implying he may be considering another run.Mr. Stearns, one of the better-known Congo analysts, argues that Mr. Kabila does not know how to get out of the corner he has put himself into.\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so difficult and volatile,\u201d Mr. Stearns said.\u201cMy best guess,\u201d he added, \u201cis we\u2019re headed into turmoil for several years to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Russians, Bleak Realities at Home", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russian hackers have been making front pages recently in the United States and Europe, but few people in Russia seem to care or even notice. The Russia of international media and the Russia that we, Russians, know from the inside could not be further apart.Abroad, President Vladimir V. Putin is seen to be upsetting the post-Cold War balance of power in Europe, pushing the United States out of the Middle East and instigating a nationalist-demagogic resurgence across the Western world. Having just helped install an American president of his choosing, he has even more king-making opportunities awaiting him in 2017, in elections set for the Netherlands, France and Germany.This, at least, is what one gleans about Mr. Putin\u2019s abilities from the Western press. But little about these feats, whether they are exaggerated or not, resounds domestically. When reported in Russia, they come across as part of the general white noise that Moscow\u2019s state-run media create every day.Most news on Russia\u2019s heavily controlled television, the media of choice for most Russians, is international, not domestic. But when the Vladimir Putin of the reports from Aleppo or Tokyo is offered to the audience, Russians see him as some distant international entity whose actions have little to do with anything happening in their own lives.Back here, it is outright scary. The latest horror is a mass poisoning in the Siberian city Irkutsk. This month 71 people were reported dead after drinking hawthorn berry tincture made with alcohol. The liquid, sold as scented bath soap, was marked \u201cnot for ingestion,\u201d but people bought it for that purpose because it was cheap \u2014 70 rubles ($1) a bottle. One shipment proved deadly because the alcohol in it was methanol, not the customary ethanol.Similar liquids are sold and commonly used as booze by destitute alcoholics throughout recession-ridden Russia, where even people with average incomes hoard cash and switch to cheaper goods during hard times. The cheapest legitimate vodka commands the controlled price of 190 rubles, or $3, in grocery stores; the alcoholics at the bottom of the income chain cannot afford even counterfeit vodka, which sells at about 100 rubles ($1.60) a bottle. The Russian Research Center of Federal and Regional Markets for Alcohol estimates that about 10 to 12 million people fit that description.News of this sort could take up much more television time, and spark more public conversation, if it were not already being spent on the war in Syria, the refugee crisis in Europe or primaries in France. Those events are what feature prominently in the media diet fed to every Russian. If the domestic agenda really were the center of public attention, people would have to face the reality not just of pauper drunkards, but also of children dying in a foster home because of a lack of funding. In that newsworthy event last August, also from Irkutsk, a state-run foster home had too little money to provide adequate treatment for its young charges, three of whom died during a dysentery epidemic.Incomes are declining, and poverty is on the rise. The economic slump that started in 2014 hit those least protected. Since 2013, the number of people living below the official poverty line has grown from 15.5 million to 21.4 million this year \u2014 14.6 percent of the population. The official threshold of poverty currently stands at 9,889 rubles a month ($160). If a European formula for poverty measurement (60 percent of median income) were used, the figure would be much higher.This is the unseemly flip side of the agile and unpredictable power that the world sees on television screens. It would be tempting to think that Russia\u2019s newly assertive and costly foreign policy was a direct reason for the failing economy and deteriorating quality of life. In fact, the cause-and-effect sequence may be the other way around. The annexation of Crimea and Moscow\u2019s later aggressive moves were not just responses to one particular event, a Western-instigated revolution in Ukraine. They were natural consequences of the Kremlin\u2019s decision to put Russia on the kind of path it is on now.Behind Russia\u2019s recession, which is slowly morphing into stagnation, are the weakened price of oil in recent years and some longer-term factors, like the state\u2019s growing role in economic matters and an unwelcoming business climate. The decline started long before Moscow went into Ukraine or Syria. The systemic nature of the current crisis is underscored by the fact that even with the oil price hovering at $50 a barrel, the Russian Finance Ministry does not project the country\u2019s economy growing faster than 1.5 percent annually, all the way to 2030.This is a man-made situation, not destiny. Central control of what Mr. Putin calls strategic economic assets and a heavily controlled social order have been his priorities since he took power in 2000. He dismantled the fledging competitive political scene Russia had in the late 1980s and the 1990s, got rid of most independent institutions and renationalized the economy. The share of state-owned and state-controlled companies contributing to gross national product increased from 35 percent in the early 2000s to 70 percent now. The number of state and municipal unitary enterprises tripled just from 2013 to 2015. \u201cRussia now has the kind of state monopoly capitalism that troubled Vladimir Lenin so much more than a century ago,\u201d Boris Grozovsky, a prominent writer about the Russian economy, concluded recently in an article for The Russia File.The economic basis for agility in Russia\u2019s current foreign policy is not much stronger these days than it was 100 years ago, before the Russian Revolution, and the concentration of wealth in a closed circle of the privileged few is similar. Nevertheless, morale is higher. The difference, of course, is that this time the modern czar has made himself popular. Nicholas II, the last czar of Russia, was never truly loved, and during the late days of his empire he became a forlorn and sad figure. His people and his inner circle abandoned him, leading even convinced monarchists to support his abdication in the face of revolution in 1917.Every Russian ruler is haunted by that vision. Mr. Putin\u2019s project all along has been to stave off anything remotely resembling the popular uprisings or betrayals by the elites in Russia\u2019s past. To reach this goal he has consolidated the power of the state in politics and the economy. But attaining the kind of security for his regime that he considers foolproof meant losing on the economic front.The result: Now a deep sense of insecurity among the public has continued to spread, rather than abate. And a realization that Russia \u2014 with its renationalized economy and aging population \u2014 is now incapable of competing on equal economic and political terms with other major powers may have led the Kremlin to believe that it can compete only by other means \u2014 namely by displaying no hesitation at using force or covert influence to claim Russian greatness again.Maxim Trudolyubov, editor at large at the business newspaper Vedomosti, writes The Russia File blog for the Kennan Institute and is a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Arizona County Where Latinos Have an Edge, So Did Trump", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byHis father, Antonio Martinez, began in one of those humble jobs after coming from Mexico illegally in 1995. He has since become a citizen through marriage and opened two barbershops in Yuma, where Mexican farm workers and Canadian snowbirds are the bulk of his winter clientele, which his shop serves from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., six days a week.\u201cIf not the fields or the barbershop,\u201d said Anthony Martinez, who helps manage his father\u2019s businesses, \u201cwhat else is there for my kids?\u201dYuma County is a lot like other counties along the southern border, a place that is anchored on the globalist trade policies and mass immigration that Mr. Trump has fervently opposed. Its agricultural industry relies almost entirely on Mexican laborers. Every morning from November through March, as many as 40,000 of them cross legally into the United States to pick most of the lettuce consumed by Americans in the cold months.But unlike the majority of border counties, this one voted for Mr. Trump, who won the county by a percentage point.Its residents now hope that he did not mean everything he said during the campaign. Instead, they want him to recognize that their economic prosperity, which they agree needs to rely on more than just agriculture, depends on maintaining connections to Mexico.\u201cThe communities are really connected,\u201d said Mayor Douglas J. Nicholls of Yuma, a Republican. \u201cYou can\u2019t think about this region without considering both sides.\u201dYuma, the county seat, stands about halfway between Phoenix and San Diego, though it is culturally and geographically isolated from both. To drivers making the trip, it is a pit stop; there is a glut of fast-food restaurants right off highway exit ramps, for a quick in and out.Eleven years ago, unauthorized immigrants would rush at the border by the hundreds, knowing that federal agents could not catch them all. These days, it is mostly Central American and Haitian migrants who are keeping the agents busy, turning themselves in at the port of entry in San Luis and asking for asylum.\u201cIllegal immigration isn\u2019t something that\u2019s on people\u2019s minds around here, Hispanic or not Hispanic,\u201d said Capt. Eben Bratcher of the Yuma County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201cThere were some people who judged him by his statements on Mexicans and Mexico,\u201d Mr. Reyes said. \u201cThen there\u2019s those who picked him because of his message on jobs.\u201dStill, they considered his portrayal of the border as lawless and unsafe, and his denunciation of Nafta as unfair to American workers, as overly broad generalizations.There are automotive plants in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across from El Paso; aerospace plants in Mexicali, southwest of Yuma; and medical devices\u2019 manufacturers in Tijuana, near San Diego. On the American side, there is a mix of retail stores, warehouses and trucking companies whose task is to move what is made in Mexico deeper into the United States and on to Canada.When workers in foreign-owned factories, known in Spanish as maquiladoras, get paid, they come across to shop at the clothing stores of San Luis and the big-box stores of Yuma.Gregorio Garcia, 68, Mayor Nicholls\u2019s father-in-law, closed his wholesale food business during the Mexican peso crisis of 1994. That same year, Nafta was signed and he opened a cross-border transportation business to bring spinach, leeks, radishes and green onions all year from Mexico to the United States, tariff-free.\u201cI\u2019ve given my wife and two daughters a good life, thanks to Mexico,\u201d said Mr. Garcia, who voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cI liked what Trump said about keeping American companies in America,\u201d he said. \u201cYuma can use some of that. We need jobs, but we also need workers.\u201dOn the edge of a field of lettuce off U.S. Highway 95, which links Yuma to San Luis, a sign read, \u201cSe solicitan empleados\u201d \u2014 workers wanted.Nearby, Miguel Mart\u00ednez, 28, managed a crew picking romaine lettuce on a patch of land before him, having already computed his losses because he could not find enough people to harvest the lettuce on a field to his left.\u201cI voted for Trump \u2014 we need to shake things up. But I\u2019d like to hear his plan to give more visas for agricultural workers,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cIf no American wants these jobs, are we going to let the lettuce go rotten?\u201dFor Antonio Martinez, the barbershop owner, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agriculture has its needs, but the jobs it offers are \u201cdead-end jobs,\u201d he said.\u201cA lot of us here, we\u2019ve studied hard, we work hard; we don\u2019t want to work on the fields, and we don\u2019t want handouts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want \u2014 what we need \u2014 are more opportunities.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on outdated information, provided the wrong margin of victory for Donald J. Trump in Yuma County. It was one percentage point, not five.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, he will begin consulting with the leaders of Italy\u2019s political parties to verify the various options open to him.The Italian president could call for new elections, but he has made clear that he will not consider returning to the polls before a new electoral law has been passed. The current electoral law for the lower house is under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court. The court announced on Tuesday that it would issue a decision on the constitutionality of the law, known as the Italicum, on Jan. 24.Another electoral law applies to the Senate, and Mr. Mattarella says he will not call new elections until a single electoral system covers both houses of Parliament, the Italian news media reported.The government crisis did not appear to rattle the Italian stock market on Wednesday, which closed up 2.1 percent. Even Italy\u2019s banks, saddled with bad loans, closed higher.Political stability has always been elusive in Italy. A combination of a multiparty system and its electoral laws make it difficult for any one party to have a strong majority.Mr. Renzi had campaigned vigorously in favor of the changes to the Constitution, but 59.1 percent of the voters rejected them.The referendum and subsequent fall of Mr. Renzi further aggravated this fissure, and speculation was rife in the news media this week over Mr. Renzi\u2019s role at the helm of the party.\u201cThere\u2019s an internal discussion that must be held that I think will be difficult,\u201d Mr. Renzi told members of his party on Wednesday afternoon. But he asked that the showdown not take place until after the Italian president resolves the government crisis. Mr. Renzi also said he would not be part of the delegation that is to meet with Mr. Matterella in coming days.The failure of the measures on the referendum call for \u201cample considerations,\u201d he said during a relaxed, joke-filled 20-minute speech at the party\u2019s headquarters. He was warmly applauded.The problems that he, and the Parliament, had hoped to resolve through the proposed changes to the Constitution still have to be dealt with, he said.In a nod to the populist pull of the Five Star Movement, the party set to pose the biggest threat in the next elections, Mr. Renzi took a page from their playbook and said that his party\u2019s discussions in coming days would be streamed online. \u201cWe want to be transparent to all citizens, and to our people,\u201d Mr. Renzi said.Various people have been discussed as possible successors to Mr. Renzi, Among them are Pietro Grasso, president of the Senate, and Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister, who is respected in Europe. The president could also ask Mr. Renzi\u2019s party to try to form another government.In a newsletter published on his website on Wednesday, Mr. Renzi said he was not in a position to decide on Italy\u2019s future anymore. \u201cThe parties \u2014 all the parties \u2014 must accept their responsibilities,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil and Gas Industry Leaders Eagerly Take Stakes in Mexican Offshore Fields", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The international oil industry on Monday agreed to pay billions of dollars to the Mexican government for rights to drill in the country\u2019s portions of the Gulf of Mexico.The companies made a big bet that oil and natural gas prices would eventually rebound enough to make additional exploration and drilling profitable. The sale was validation of Mexico\u2019s decision to open its former government-monopoly energy business to foreign investment and expertise.\u201cThis is a vote of confidence that the energy reform is moving forward and for the geological potential of the Mexican Gulf deep waters,\u201d said Jorge R. Pi\u00f1on, former president of Amoco Oil Latin America and now an analyst at the University of Texas at Austin.\u201cEverybody paid a premium and that premium indicates the potential of the blocks,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00f1on said.The government awarded eight separate blocks of offshore territory to companies including Total of France and Exxon Mobil and Chevron of the United States, which all already have a strong presence in the Gulf of Mexico and can therefore take advantage of existing service crews and pipelines they use in Gulf waters.The most significant new entry may be by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, which won two blocks in the auction. Cnooc also has a strong presence in Latin America, and could now become a big player in Mexico as well.Perhaps more than anything else, the bidding shows that the industry has confidence it will emerge from its current malaise of low prices, layoffs and cuts in capital spending. The companies are betting that if prices recover, they can profitably produce oil from high-cost, deepwater projects.As further testing and development proceeds, the deepwater Mexican fields will probably not produce a significant amount of oil for at least a decade. But by that time, many energy analysts say oil prices might be $80 a barrel or more, compared with the current price of just over $50 a barrel.The Mexican government had offered 10 exploratory blocks in total, estimating that they contained as much as 11 billion barrels of oil and natural gas \u2014 equivalent to estimates of oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea. Two of the blocks were not awarded because they received no bids.But the day\u2019s bidding nonetheless indicated strong interest in venturing further into the Gulf of Mexico.\u201cYou hit all the points: multinationals, majors, eight out of 10, national oil companies, geographic diversity,\u2019\u2019 said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a resounding success.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.In a separate auction, BHP Billiton offered $624 million to team up with state-owned Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex, to develop a field called Trion, in what will be the first joint venture in the Mexican company\u2019s 78-year history. BHP Billiton beat out the British oil giant BP, which offered $18 million less.Pemex will also be a minority investor in a block won by a team led by Chevron.\u201cIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s a great opportunity for everyone, including Mexico,\u201d Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and Production, told reporters shortly after the auction. \u201cEverybody in the oil and gas sector is interested in Mexico, especially the deepwater.\u201dThe auction provides a rare moment of positive news in a gloomy period for Mexico. The peso has been battered by concern that the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is the foundation of Mexico\u2019s manufacturing exports.The new entrants to Mexico\u2019s oil industry are expected to invest about $40 billion as they develop the deepwater fields.The auctions were the result of Mexico instituting energy reform legislation in 2013 and 2014, which ended the 75-year-old monopoly of Pemex and opened the country to foreign investment for oil exploration, production, pipeline construction and other energy ventures. The effort was viewed as the only way to end years of declining production.Pemex did not have the financial or technical skill to exploit the deepwater reserves on its own.The timing of the auction could have been better. Oil prices are half what they were a little more than two years ago, when a barrel of oil cost more than $100 a barrel. Today it is just over $50 a barrel, and companies are spending far less on exploration. But Monday\u2019s bidding indicated a long-term optimism.Global concerns about climate change and the sluggish global economy have slowed, but not stopped, growth in demand for oil and natural gas. Energy analysts say that even if oil demand peaks in the next decade or so, oil companies will still have to drill new wells because older wells decline over time. Shale wells, which are common in the United States, normally decline the most rapidly.The successful auction highlights the fact that drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is a better bet than drilling in the Arctic, which is extremely expensive and risky, or in many places in Africa or the Middle East, which are politically volatile.Close to the United States and its giant market and refineries, Mexico\u2019s Gulf waters also offer plentiful pipelines, ports and other energy infrastructure. And while drug violence is prevalent in Mexico, the country has been politically stable for decades.Another winner in Monday\u2019s auction was BP.Just last week, only a day after oil prices stabilized with the OPEC agreement to cut production, BP decided to move ahead with a $9 billion project to drill in the Gulf of Mexico in a field in United States waters where the company already operates.Much of the region has been heavily tested with seismic equipment, and four of the auctioned blocks are adjacent to areas in the United States portion of the Gulf. Oil executives said they would thoroughly assess the areas before drilling, but they were confident that the fields would be productive.Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Restaurant Recession\u2019 From Health Care Act? Little Evidence", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byOf all the policy positions taken by Andrew F. Puzder, the fast-food chief executive whom Donald J. Trump has chosen to be his secretary of labor, one he returns to with regularity is his passionate disdain for the Affordable Care Act and its effect on businesses and workers.He has also argued that the act has given businesses an incentive to cut back on full-time workers to avoid the costs of providing them with insurance, as the act frequently requires.The problem is that the available data largely disagree.But industry numbers don\u2019t indicate this is having much of an effect. According to the National Restaurant Association, sales across the industry will be about $780 billion in 2016, up roughly 5 percent over the previous year. If you restrict the focus to fast food, sales are projected to be higher, too \u2014 just under 6 percent, to about $223 billion, though the group notes that individual companies and regions may be struggling.Neither does the data on restaurant industry employment suggest many ill effects. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the \u201cfood services and drinking places\u201d industry is up roughly 200,000 this calendar year, and by nearly one million since Americans began buying health care through the Affordable Care Act.Ben Spielberg of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, looked at the rise in premiums that a 27-year-old would pay for a common low-cost insurance plan under the health law. He compared that with employment in food services and drinking establishments over the same period.The analysis looked at the 33 states in which data on both was available and concluded that there was no correlation between employment growth in the industry and premiums. States where premiums increased more did not tend to have lower employment.The study\u2019s finding may seem counterintuitive, but it is consistent with the experience of at least some large fast-food outlets. Todd Penegor, the chief executive of Wendy\u2019s, said in an interview on Friday that while health care and rent costs have eaten into consumers\u2019 budgets, his company added stores in 2016 for the first time in years after previously scaling back stores. Mr. Penegor attributed the development to a successful new marketing program and a package of low-cost menu options.To the extent that some restaurants are struggling, one explanation may be shifting consumer tastes rather than health care costs. A recent survey by the National Restaurant Association suggests that healthier offerings are gaining popularity, which could disadvantage traditional fast-food outlets. \u201cTraffic has been incredibly strong for us,\u201d said Nic Jammet, co-founder and co-chief executive of the salad chain Sweetgreen. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for us, not just with new store growth and customer acquisition but also our same-store sales have grown nicely, too.\u201dMr. Puzder\u2019s second complaint, that the law raises labor costs by mandating that employers cover full-time workers, appears more grounded in reality. It certainly would increase costs for employers who did not previously provide insurance coverage to full-time workers. \u201cWe took a big hit initially from what we had paid previously,\u201d said Xavier Teixido, who owns three restaurants in Delaware and had provided full health coverage only to salaried managerial employees before the Affordable Care Act, though he offered a catastrophic illness plan to hourly workers.\u201cThe restaurant industry has historically represented one of the largest segments with workers without health coverage,\u201d said Paul Sonn, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project, which advocates on behalf of low-wage workers. \u201cThe A.C.A. has had a huge impact expanding access to low-cost and in many cases zero-cost coverage for restaurant workers.\u201dA question for Mr. Puzder, who has declined requests to comment since he was chosen for the post, is whether his view of labor \u2014 and national policy \u2014 will be overly shaped by his experience within one corner of one industry.\u201cWe see different goals between a business owner trying to hold down costs and a national policy maker who ought to be focused on making sure that the benefits of growth are fairly and broadly shared,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein. \u201cFor a guy like Puzder, suppressing labor costs is a good day at work. For the labor secretary, that\u2019s not the goal.\u201dLawrence H. Summers, the former treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and an economic adviser to President Obama, argues that one key to policy making is to avoid the fallacy of composition, in which what hurts or helps one actor does not necessarily produce the same effect when everyone does it. \u201cIf one firm raises wages, that firm may be less competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if wages are raised at all firms, spending power may rise, and that may stimulate the economy.\u201dMr. Summers added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a left-wing truth or a right-wing truth. You can\u2019t calculate all the effects of a policy just by generalizing from the experience of a business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Resolution on Israeli Settlements", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump\u2019s forceful intervention was a rare effort by a new president to shape international events even before taking office. While new presidents typically refrain from weighing in on current issues during the interregnum between their election and inauguration, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement underscored that he does not plan to wait for the swearing in.Mr. Trump said flatly that he should. \u201cAs the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\u201d the president-elect said. \u201cThis puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201dMr. Trump amplified his position by posting the statement on Facebook and Twitter as well, but a transition official insisted on anonymity to confirm the president-elect\u2019s conversation with Mr. Sisi because of the sensitivity of the matter. Mr. Trump\u2019s words echoed the positions expressed by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a breath of fresh air after years of clashes with Mr. Obama.Mr. Netanyahu cited that history on Thursday. \u201cI hope the U.S. won\u2019t abandon this policy,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it will abide by the principles set by President Obama himself in his speech in the U.N. in 2011 \u2014 that peace will come not through U.N. resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties.\u201dA Palestinian delegation traveled to Washington this month to urge Mr. Obama\u2019s team to support the anti-settlement resolution or at least abstain. Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers did not disclose a position and were holding out until the vote to watch how the matter developed. The Palestinians were unable to meet with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and expressed disappointment on Thursday with his position. \u201cA veto means support of settlement activities,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said after the resolution was pulled. \u201cA veto means abandoning the two-state solution and peace efforts.\u201dAsked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, a visibly upset Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said, \u201cHe is acting on behalf of Netanyahu.\u201dEgypt backed off on the resolution after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government put pressure on Mr. Sisi\u2019s government to withdraw it, shortly before Arab ambassadors meeting at the United Nations endorsed it.Mr. Netanyahu treated the pending United Nations vote as a crisis, staying up late into the night discussing it with aides and posting on his own Twitter account, at 3:28 a.m. local time, a message urging Mr. Obama to veto what he called the \u201canti-Israel\u201d resolution. \u201cThe Israelis leaned on the Egyptians this morning to postpone the vote, and the Egyptians basically caved,\u201d said a Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the matter.Arab officials met in Cairo on Thursday night to consider their next move. \u201cThe negotiations over the Arab proposal for the Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territories are still not finished at both the United Nations and the Arab League\u2019s anti-occupation committee,\u201d said Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, according to Egyptian state news.If the White House had let the resolution pass, it would have been a symbolic blow to the diplomatic shield that the United States has always offered Israel. It would also have sent a strong signal of international disapproval over the construction of settlements, regarded by many as illegal under international law.A former top Obama adviser suggested that the president should consider supporting the resolution because settlements are an obstacle to peace and therefore the real damage to Israel. \u201cThe resolution is about settlements, not negotiations,\u201d Martin Indyk, a former special envoy under Mr. Obama, wrote on Twitter. \u201cVetoing would mean vetoing US policy on settlements.\u201dBut Aaron David Miller, another former Middle East peace negotiator, said supporting the resolution would have plunged the administration into an issue that the past several administrations had avoided: the legality of the settlements.\u201cThe problem with voting for this,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cis that Trump will disavow it and U.S. credibility on the issue will again be undermined, not to mention what the Israelis might do on the ground in response, to which the new administration may acquiesce.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Jerusalem, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.

{"Headline": "Where Will NASA Go in the Age of Trump?", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byOut ThereTwo weeks after a presidential election that could have vaulted him to the head of NASA, John Grunsfeld reached across his peanut curry at a small restaurant on the Far West Side of Manhattan, grabbed my notebook and sketched out a plan for a trip to Mars.In the days leading up the election, Dr. Grunsfeld said, NASA was thinking about a Mars mission to get ready for the transition. He himself was rumored to be on the short list to run the space agency should Hillary Clinton have won.\u201cNASA has never had a scientist as administrator; you and I would have had fun,\u201d he said.Now, nobody knows where NASA\u2019s rockets are going on their biblical smoke pillars. Donald J. Trump\u2019s one mention of the space program during his campaign was to tell a kid that potholes on Earth need fixing first.But he also campaigned on the promise to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d and hardly anything in recent history says that more clearly than the Apollo moon landings. That has some space buffs hoping that a Trump administration will put its weight behind another grand adventure in space, most likely a return for good to the moon.At the same time, there is no evidence that Congress would give NASA any more money than it is already getting to carry out these adventures. Mr. Trump\u2019s potholes, a military buildup and tax cuts beckon.Last summer many of these insiders, including Michael Griffin, a former NASA former administrator, gathered around a television at Mr. Shank\u2019s house to cheer on Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, as she spoke at the Republican National Convention. Denouncing what she saw as a lack of American leadership, at least as far as human spaceflight was concerned, she noted that it had been five years since an American was launched into space from American soil.\u201cWe are a nation of explorers,\u201d she declared. \u201cNations that lead on the frontier lead in the world.\u201dAre we in for another outer space pivot back to the moon?Among the many Trump advisers is Newt Gingrich, who promised a lunar colony by 2020 when he was running for president four years ago, quipping that it could apply for statehood someday.At the time eyes rolled, but times have changed. Recently Jeb Bush declared it a \u201ccool\u201d idea. Europe, China and Russia are all reportedly eager to establish a base on the moon.Jim Bridenstine, an Oklahoma congressman rumored to be in the hunt for NASA administrator, said in a recent speech: \u201cThis is our Sputnik moment. America must forever be the pre-eminent spacefaring nation, and the moon is our path to being so.\u201dAmong the attractions of a lunar base, its adherents say, would be the ability to mine ice at the moon\u2019s poles to produce rocket fuel. According to recent studies, refueling at the moon, or nearby, would be the cheapest way to go to Mars.It could be the mother of all infrastructure projects, perhaps a notion attractive to Mr. Trump\u2019s developer instincts, in effect paving a highway to Mars and beyond.It would also take a lot of money, time and political capital.\u201cThe moon\u2019s a nice place to visit, but you wouldn\u2019t want to live there,\u201d Dr. Grunsfeld said.But we can go to Mars without breaking NASA\u2019s budget, Dr. Grunsfeld said, reaching for my notebook.First he drew a line of rockets.Forget the giant heavy-lift super booster rocket. Assemble a Mars spacecraft in orbit using the kinds of rockets like Atlas or Delta we already have.Suppose it takes 10 launches to get all the pieces up there, he said. At $350 million a launch, that adds up to $3.5 billion.Adding in another $500 million to launch the crew brings the total to $4 billion.If the spaceship segments themselves cost $1 billion apiece, the whole Mars ship is $14 billion.Make two, just to be on the safe side.\u201cFor $4 billion a year for seven years you get a Martian spaceship including a full spare,\u201d he said.Where does the money come from?As it happens, this is the amount of money NASA now spends on the space station every year, money that will be available one day to go someplace.They could only go around Mars, without landing . But it would still be an epochal voyage, the interplanetary version of Apollo 8\u2019s Christmas voyage around the moon in 1968, setting the stage for what is to come if people are ever going to live off-planet.Someone should do it. All that money would be spent here \u2014 on things we say we care about, like science, technological development and education, things that stimulate the economy and inspire generations.\u201cGoing to Mars would make NASA great again,\u201d Dr. Grunsfeld said.I asked him how long it would all take. Seven to 10 years, he texted me later. \u201cWhenever someone decides to start.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tough Trade Talk Could Damage American Factories", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byHOLLAND, Mich. \u2014 While much of the American political class has been consumed with recriminations over the wrenching loss of manufacturing jobs, Chuck Reid has been quietly adding them.But those jobs will be in jeopardy if President-elect Donald J. Trump follows through on his combative promises to punish countries he deems guilty of unfair trade.But many existing American manufacturing jobs depend heavily on access to a broad array of goods drawn from a global supply chain \u2014 fabrics, chemicals, electronics and other parts. Many of them come from China. At Mr. Reid\u2019s factory, imports account for roughly two-thirds of the cost of making a recliner chair.In short, Mr. Trump\u2019s signature trade promise, one ostensibly aimed at protecting American jobs, may well deliver the reverse: It risks making successful American manufacturers more vulnerable by raising their costs. It would unleash havoc on the global supply chain, prompting some multinationals to leave the United States and shift manufacturing to countries where they can be assured of buying components at the lowest prices.\u201cIf you do this tomorrow, you would have a lot of disruption,\u201d said Susan Helper, an economist at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cThe stuff that China now makes and the way they make it, it\u2019s not trivial to replicate that.\u201dMr. Reid takes pride in using American products. His designers here in Michigan dreamed up his sleek recliner. Local hands construct the frames using American-made steel, then affix molded foam from a factory in nearby Grand Rapids. They staple upholstery to hunks of wood harvested by timber operations in Wisconsin. They do all this inside a former heating and cooling equipment factory that shut down a decade ago when the work shifted to Mexico.But the fabric for Mr. Reid\u2019s seats arrives from China. So do the electronics in the \u201cmagic box\u201d that enables moviegoers to control the recliner. Ditto, the plastic cup holders and the bolts and screws that hold the parts together. The motor is the work of a German company that makes it in Hungary, almost certainly using electronics from China.Trade has contributed to economic growth, but changing dynamics have also prompted concerns about lost jobs and the trade deficit. But when something is manufactured in the United States, it is often made up of parts from around the world.Mr. Reid estimates that a 45 percent tariff on Chinese wares would raise the costs of making a recliner here by 20 percent.Tariffs would give his factory an edge against American competitors that import even more from China. But his company would be vulnerable to competitors in Mexico, Colombia and Australia. They would be free to draw on China\u2019s supply chain and sell their wares into the American market unhindered.\u201cOur chair would be priced out of the market,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cIf it impacts our sales, that puts jobs at risk.\u201dInternational law also limits the scope of what the Trump administration can do. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, the United States cannot willy-nilly apply tariffs. It must develop cases industry by industry, proving that China is damaging American rivals through unfair practices.Talk of across-the-board tariffs is \u201cpure theater,\u201d said Marc L. Busch, an expert on international trade policy at Georgetown University in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do. It violates the rule of law.\u201dThe people advising Mr. Trump on trade have records of advocating a pugnacious response to what they portray as Chinese predations.In an email on Friday, Mr. Navarro, the Trump transition team\u2019s economic adviser, said that imposing steep tariffs on China was an essential step to begin to address the American trade deficit with China, which reached $365 billion last year. He blamed Chinese trade practices for \u201cdestroying entire industries, hollowing out entire communities\u201d and \u201cputting millions out of work.\u201dBut Mr. Navarro also cast the threat of tariffs as an opening gambit in a refashioning of trade positions.\u201cTariffs are not an end game but merely one of several negotiating tools to bring our trade back into balance,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration would do so \u201cin a measured way.\u201dMr. Navarro\u2019s co-author, Greg Autry, a professor at the University of Southern California, said he assumed the Trump camp was dead serious about its threats to impose tariffs on China. The goal is to force manufacturers to come back to the United States as a condition of selling into the American market.A full-on trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies would cost American jobs in the immediate term, Mr. Autry said, but eventually millions of new ones would be created as the United States again hummed with factory work.\u201cWe moved our supply chain to Asia in about two decades,\u201d he said. \u201cYou certainly can do it in the U.S. a whole lot faster. It\u2019s going to take a few years, but it\u2019s going to be a much better America.\u201dEven if factory work does return to the United States, though, that is unlikely to translate into many paychecks. As automation spreads, robots are primed to secure most of the jobs.At Mr. Reid\u2019s factory, talk of a bountiful future through trade barriers resonates as dangerous nonsense. Mr. Reid has a business to run in the here and now. His customers are waiting for product. He must be able to tap the supply chain.\u201cYou can\u2019t just turn your ship around and bring that stuff back,\u201d he said.In threatening tariffs, Mr. Trump is wielding a blunt instrument whose impacts are increasingly easy to evade by sophisticated businesses with operations across multiple borders. The geography of global trade is perpetually being redrawn.In China, factory owners, casting a wary eye on Mr. Trump, are accelerating their exploration of alternative locales with lower-wage workers across Southeast Asia and even as far away as Africa.In Vietnam, entrepreneurs are preparing for a potential surge of incoming investment from China should Mr. Trump take action.In Europe, factories that sell manufacturing equipment to China are watching to see if Mr. Trump will unleash trade hostilities that will damage global growth.\u201cMoney and goods will always find their way, regardless of what barriers you put up,\u201d said Ernesto Maurer, chairman of SSM, a Swiss maker of textile machinery that operates a factory in China. \u201cYou just make it more difficult and more expensive.\u201dIn the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, Jiang Jiacheng exudes confidence that China will continue to serve as the factory floor for the world \u2014 with tariffs or otherwise.His company, the Guangzhou Shuqee Digital Tech Company, makes movie chairs, exporting about 20 percent of its wares to the United States. It is an exemplar both of China\u2019s manufacturing prowess and of the conditions that make it a competitive threat.Mr. Jiang pays his factory workers $290 a month. They work six days a week. Lax environmental rules allow him to dispose of pollutants cheaply.The total cost of making one of his best-selling products, a cloth-lined movie chair, runs $72. He sells it for $116 to wholesalers who export to the United States.Back in September, Mr. Jiang gathered with other Chinese movie chair manufacturers to discuss the alarming statements coming from Mr. Trump. The consensus view was not to worry.\u201cOnce he takes up the post, he will certainly return things to the normal state,\u201d Mr. Jiang said.Still, he has a backup plan. Even before President Trump entered the lexicon, Mr. Jiang was exploring a transfer of some of his work to lower-cost places like Vietnam.His company would not be the first to make the journey.A dozen years ago, the United States Commerce Department accused China of dumping wooden bedroom furniture at below cost. It imposed protective tariffs.For Lawrence M. D. Yen, who had a furniture factory in southern China, that was the impetus to move to Vietnam. Labor costs were cheaper.Today, Mr. Yen\u2019s company, Woodworth Wooden Industries, operates a factory in Cu Chi, on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, a district best known for the elaborate tunnels used by Vietcong guerrillas in their battles against American forces.This former hive of combat is now the workplace for 5,000 people making sofa beds, recliner chairs and bedroom furniture. Three-fourths of the products are destined for the United States, including Las Vegas casino resorts like Mandalay Bay and the MGM Grand.Woodworth\u2019s plant churns out more than 10,000 three-seater sofas each month. This year, the company opened a second Vietnam factory.Arithmetic gives Mr. Yen confidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s talk will be muted by the realities of the marketplace. Brands that deliver factory-made goods to American retailers have leaned heavily on Asian suppliers to secure low prices.In pledging to bring manufacturing back, Mr. Trump is effectively pitting the interests of a relatively small group of people \u2014 those who work in factories \u2014 against hundreds of millions of consumers.\u201cThe retail industry now employs an awful lot more people than apparel industries ever did,\u201d said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at Georgetown.The TAL Group claims to make one of every six dress shirts sold in the United States. It produces finished goods for Brooks Brothers, Banana Republic and J. Crew, operating 11 factories worldwide. If Mr. Trump places tariffs on China, the company will accelerate its shift to Vietnam, said TAL\u2019s chief executive, Roger Lee.If that trade is disrupted, the work would flow to other low-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. Mr. Lee can envision no situation in which the physically taxing, monotonous work of making garments will go to the United States.\u201cWhere are you going to find the work force in the U.S. that is willing to work at factories?\u201d Mr. Lee said.Horgen, a Swiss village on the shores of Lake Zurich, seems far removed from the gritty industrial zones of Asia. With its gingerbread homes and mountain views, it looks more like a resort.But Horgen is home to SSM, a company that has become an important supplier to Asia. Its machines turn polyester and other synthetic fibers into custom-designed threads. If the rise of textiles in Asia has been a gold rush, this Swiss company has been among those cashing in by making the picks and shovels.Workers at the factory earn roughly 6,000 Swiss francs ($5,940) a month \u2014 some 10 times what SSM pays its workers at its Chinese factory. It makes its most sophisticated components in Switzerland and at another plant in Italy. It uses China for lower-grade machines.The company sells virtually all of its products abroad, chiefly in Asia. It buys metal parts from the Czech Republic and Poland, electronic components from Malaysia, and electric motors from an American company that makes them at a factory in India. Another American company supplies software.\u201cThere is not a single machine that we have that we are able to build with materials from one country,\u201d said Mr. Maurer, the SSM chairman.If the United States were to impose trade barriers on China, that might slow Chinese demand for Swiss-made textile machinery. That would potentially reduce Swiss purchases of American goods and services.But Mr. Maurer struggles to see how this would create any jobs in the United States. The American textile industry is small and increasingly dominated by robots. The rest of the world holds billions of hands willing to work cheaply.\u201cSomeone else will pick up the business,\u201d Mr. Maurer said. \u201cThese markets are very fast.\u201dBut the textile and apparel trades are relatively simple businesses. If the cost of making trousers becomes less appealing in China, a room full of sewing machines in Cambodia can quickly be filled with low-wage seamstresses.Industries involving precision machinery are not so easily reassembled somewhere else. An abrupt change to the economics would devastate factories that could not quickly line up alternative suppliers.American automakers are especially dependent on the global supply chain. Between 2000 and 2011, the percentage of imported components that went into exported American-made vehicles grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.At EBW Electronics in Holland, Mich., workers in lab coats tend boxy soldering machines as they make circuitry for LED lights that go into cars. It buys tiny parts and slots them into circuit boards, which are sold to major automakers. Some 80 percent of the components are imported from China.Even that number fails to capture the degree to which the company \u2014 and its 240 workers \u2014 depend on unfettered trade.Pat LeBlanc, the chairman, pointed to a nib of metal on a circuit board. The silicon was extracted at a plant in Minnesota, then processed into a thin wafer at another factory in Massachusetts. The wafer was shipped to China for testing, cut into pieces at another Chinese factory, and then delivered to the Philippines for a chemical process. Then it went back to China to be put onto a reel that can be inserted into soldering machines here in Michigan.\u201cIt literally is a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. LeBlanc said.Mr. Reid, the owner of the theater seating company, could not imagine having to buy everything from American suppliers.Buying upholstery domestically would raise his fabric costs as much as 40 percent.\u201cAll the componentry, all the cords, it all comes from China,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you could ever get all of that made in the United States. Some of these industries have just been abandoned.\u201dHe wandered into the paint shop, where a worker was spraying chair backs. He picked up a can of paint and read the label: \u201cMade in the U.S.A., with Global Materials.\u201dPeter S. Goodman reported from Holland, Mich.; Neil Gough from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Sui-Lee Wee from Guangzhou, China; and Jack Ewing from Horgen, Switzerland.

{"Headline": "Shielding Seized Assets From Corruption\u2019s Clutches", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "An effort by the United States to seize assets from officials who stole their countries\u2019 wealth is now focused on returning the loot without enriching the looters.Supported byOne would think that an iconic Michael Jackson \u201cBad Tour\u201d glove, covered in Swarovski crystals and worn on his first solo tour, would rest in a place of honor, perhaps at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.Hardly. The bejeweled glove is thousands of miles away in the oil-rich, deeply impoverished country of Equatorial Guinea. And the people of this West African nation, most of whom live on less than $2 a day, have paid dearly for it.This is something that few other nations attempt. Now comes the hard part: returning the seized money to the people of the countries affected without enriching a kleptocrat all over again.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see the funds disappear and go back to those who caused the harm,\u201d said Leslie R. Caldwell, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.Some $3 billion, involving nations worldwide, has been frozen by the program \u2014 including a Malibu mansion and a $500,000 Ferrari (but not the white glove) owned by a member of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s ruling family, the Obiangs. The family\u2019s patriarch is so wealthy that he tops Queen Elizabeth II on lists of the global rich.This repatriation effort is getting started just as Donald J. Trump\u2019s election as president threatens to complicate the message of the kleptocracy initiative. Mr. Trump, a Republican, has promised to avoid potential conflicts of interest between his business empire and his duties as commander in chief, and has indicated he will come up with a plan before the inauguration.Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will have special resonance for a program that goes after foreign leaders whose business and government positions are porous. There are worries that if Mr. Trump does not sufficiently distance his business and his family from politics, it will be tougher for the Justice Department to criticize foreign leaders who have become wealthy based on their government ties.\u201cThe election of Donald Trump might impede the commitment of the United States to fight kleptocracy,\u201d said Matthew C. Stephenson, a professor who teaches anticorruption law at Harvard Law School. \u201cThe political consequences are that it reduces U.S. leverage because of the perceived hypocrisy. The moral case is drastically undermined.\u201dTutu Alicante, executive director of EG Justice, a Washington nonprofit that monitors corruption in Africa, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect scenario for kleptocrats in Africa to point to someone in the White House. They will compare themselves to Donald Trump.\u201dRepresentatives of both the Justice Department and Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment.The Obiang case is the biggest to date and, for that reason, is being closely watched. It is also the rare time that the kleptocracy initiative has gone after such a senior officeholder. A member of the Obiang family bought many of his assets as part of a \u201ccorruption fueled spending spree,\u201d according to the Justice Department.Under an agreement with the department, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has promised to give up valuables he amassed in the United States, ending years of litigation. His title is vice president, with an official salary of around $100,000. His father came to power in a coup in 1979 and is the longest-serving African leader and president in the world, ruling with \u201calmost total control,\u201d according to a recent report from the Central Intelligence Agency. The son is seen as a possible heir apparent.The Justice Department hailed its agreement with the younger Mr. Obiang as a significant step forward for its program. The idea is to create a charity in Equatorial Guinea funded by $30 million from the sale of his 15,000-square-foot Malibu oceanfront mansion, the Ferrari 599 and other assets, including additional Jackson memorabilia.\u201cWe are touching the untouchables,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cWe are saying that the U.S. financial system is not a safe haven for corruption.\u201dThe department has both a desire and an obligation to repatriate assets flowing through the American banking system. The United States, along with 140 other countries, is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, an agreement requiring countries to hunt down the offshore money of corrupt officials and return it to the victimized countries. The World Bank estimates that from $20 billion to $40 billion is stolen annually by corrupt public officials, mostly in poor and developing countries.So far only a small number of nations are actively pursuing kleptocracy cases \u2014 mainly the United States, Britain, Canada, Luxembourg and Switzerland. This is in part because few countries have the resources to take on the complicated cases.Ownership of the assets is often hidden by a web of shell companies. Offshore accounts created by sharp lawyers and accountants can be hard to trace. A court must determine whether other interested parties have valid claims to ownership and if the assets were bought with illicitly obtained money. Only then can the assets be seized and the money repatriated.The corrupt assets that the Justice Department has tracked down are valued at $3 billion and have come from a laundry list of countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ukraine and Uzbekistan among them. In the case of Malaysia, money was also used to buy a $35 million jet, pay for gambling in Las Vegas and buy art by Van Gogh and Monet. The actor Leonardo DiCaprio, whose movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d was produced by the company tied to the Malaysian case, has said he was cooperating with the government case and would return any funds that his charity or the movie received that turned out to have been stolen.In the largest case against a person, the Justice Department is seeking $850 million from Gulnara Karimova, the socialite daughter of the late president of Uzbekistan who goes by the nickname Googoosha. The Harvard-educated former model and pop singer is accused by the United States of accepting bribes to allow a Dutch telecom company to enter the Uzbek market. A leaked American diplomatic cable said she was the \u201cthe single most hated person\u201d in Uzbekistan and a \u201cgreedy power hungry individual.\u201d After a falling out with her father in 2014, Ms. Karimova was placed under house arrest, where she remains today.Three lawyers representing Uzbekistan in the Justice Department matter did not respond to requests for comment, nor did officials at the Uzbekistan Embassy in Washington. In court filings, lawyers representing Uzbekistan argue that the United States has \u201cat best a minimal interest in the bribery and money-laundering scheme\u201d involving Ms. Karimova because \u201cthe corruption alleged in the complaint is fundamentally an Uzbek matter.\u201dAnother big-ticket case involves Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria, who died nearly two decades ago. His case has wended through the courts since then. In play is $630 million from his estate that the United States says he and his cronies laundered through the American financial system. The United States has gained access to $480 million and is in litigation over the rest.Daniel Horowitz, Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s lawyer, said that there had been \u201czero evidence of wrongdoing\u201d by Mr. Lazarenko and that \u201cthe case is about the U.S. government wanting to keep the money.\u201d He described Ukraine as \u201ca place with no rules\u201d and added that \u201c80 percent of the world outside the United States and Europe has no rules.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to determine what is right and wrong,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said.The World Bank is tracking the offshore money of leaders toppled during the Arab Spring, including those of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. Some money has been repatriated to the Tunisian treasury to help stabilize the country. In the cases of Libya and Egypt, the countries are so unstable and dangerous, though, that repatriation is impossible. An estimated $200 million in offshore assets of the Assad family of Syria and their associates were frozen by Switzerland, the European Union and the United States.\u201cAsset recovery is highly contentious and difficult to negotiate,\u201d said Emile van der Does de Willebois, global lead for financial market integrity at the World Bank. \u201cThe victim country can say that this is our money, we need it and we want it back.\u201d But, he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t just give back a blank check.\u201dEquatorial Guinea shows why. Under an agreement with the Justice Department, $20 million from the sale of Teodoro Obiang\u2019s American assets will be given to a charitable organization selected by the agency and Mr. Obiang. Another $10 million will be administered solely by the United States.But the big question is whether the department can structure a charity so that the money is not controlled by the Obiangs or used to enhance their image and power. That is a tall order for Justice Department lawyers who are more accustomed to hunting down bad characters than to setting up offshore charities.\u201cThis is a challenge and very different than what prosecutors are trained to do,\u201d said Mr. Stephenson, the Harvard professor.Complicating matters in Equatorial Guinea is that there are almost no existing charities. That is largely because the Obiang family has clamped down on any organization that promotes democracy or challenges its rule.\u201cThis won\u2019t be an easy process,\u201d said Mr. Alicante of EG Justice, which promotes human rights in that country. \u201cUnless the U.S. government stays alert, the money will disappear through corruption and we\u2019ll be back at square one.\u201dThe $30 million from the sale of Mr. Obiang\u2019s Malibu mansion, his Ferrari and assorted Jackson statues is currently in an escrow account controlled by the Justice Department. The Equatorial Guinean Embassy and Mr. Obiang\u2019s American lawyers did not respond to several requests for comment. Ms. Caldwell, of the Justice Department, said plans for the repatriation of the Obiang money were still being made final under the terms of the court agreement.Of that amount, the Justice Department had targeted $70 million in Mr. Obiang\u2019s American assets and was outfoxed, ending up with only about half that amount. Mr. Obiang kept his $38 million Gulfstream jet flying around the world, only in locations where the United States lacked jurisdiction to seize it. That meant, though, that he was unable to have regular servicing performed on the aircraft, which has depressed its value \u2014 and made it less attractive to potential passengers.As for the Jackson glove, it was spirited out of the United States in defiance of an American court order, according to prosecutors.The French authorities have helped by seizing a multimillion-dollar fleet of Mr. Obiang\u2019s exotic cars, including a $2 million Bugatti Veyron and two $600,000 Rolls-Royce Drophead Coup\u00e9s, a $380,000 Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago and a $424,000 Bentley Azure. Mr. Obiang is scheduled to go on trial in Paris next week on corruption and money laundering charges after losing a bid in early December before the International Court of Justice to halt the proceedings.On Dec. 2, at the request of the Swiss, the Dutch authorities seized Mr. Obiang\u2019s 250-foot, $100 million yacht, \u201cEbony Shine,\u201d as it was about to sail to Equatorial Guinea, according to the Swiss publication L\u2019Hebdo. Mr. Obiang denied ownership of the yacht, saying that it belonged his country\u2019s government. He has another yacht based in Tangier.Andreas Ledergerber, a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington, said that, in spite of criticism, the repatriated money \u201ccontributed to the mine-removal process\u201d at the end of the Angola civil war, where antipersonnel mines remain a \u201cmajor danger to the population.\u201dSwitzerland also repatriated more than $500 million of seized Abacha money to Nigeria to be used for health, education, water and roads. Instead, the money disappeared into the country\u2019s general budget with no oversight, according to a World Bank report. And in Egypt, the tumultuous political situation caused many repatriation cases to be dropped.On the brighter side is Kazakhstan, where the BOTA Foundation was created with $115 million in seized money under an agreement among the United States, Switzerland and Kazakhstan. The foundation established in 2009 to help the country\u2019s poor is now held up as a model to emulate.The foundation was able to operate without interference from the country\u2019s ruling elite and to fulfill its mandate successfully. A total of $79 million went for social service and education programs that helped an estimated 200,000 people. Even so, BOTA drew some criticism for administrative and start-up costs that took about a third of the money, and because it did not continue operating after the original money was spent.Some countries are so corrupt that repatriation may not even be possible, experts say. Uzbekistan may be one of them.A recent C.I.A. report described Uzbekistan as being plagued by \u201cpervasive corruption.\u201d Its citizens, including children, are subject to \u201cgovernment-compelled forced labor\u201d in the country\u2019s cotton fields, according to the report. It also found \u201cofficial complicity in human trafficking.\u201dYet Uzbekistan occupies a strategic location in Central Asia and on an important logistics supply route for troops in Afghanistan. That limits the extent to which the United States can challenge the country\u2019s ruling family.The Justice Department\u2019s case focuses on Ms. Karimova, who was once seen as her father\u2019s successor until their falling out. She did not attend his funeral in September.She designed a line of jewelry, perfume and clothing, although her 2011 show at New York Fashion Week was canceled amid protests over Uzbekistan\u2019s human rights violations. She served as the country\u2019s ambassador to Spain and representative to the United Nations in Geneva.Ms. Karimova also faced investigations in Sweden, Switzerland and the United States over accusations of bribery and money laundering. Within her own country, she is considered a \u201crobber baron,\u201d who would \u201ccrush business people or anyone else who stands in her way,\u201d according to a leaked American diplomatic cable. The United States was able to file charges because the $850 million in suspected bribes passed through the American financial system on the way to accounts in Britain, Hong Kong, Latvia, Luxembourg and other places.Sunshine Uzbekistan, a group of Uzbek human rights activists living in exile, has asked the Justice Department not to repatriate the money but to put it into a trust for use when conditions improve. Repatriating the money before that would mean it \u201cwould disappear,\u201d the group said in a letter to the department. The group argues that a trust fund would provide an incentive for the country to improve its human rights record as a condition of getting the money.\u201cThe Justice Department is the last hope for the Uzbek people,\u201d Sanjar G. Umarov, founder of the coalition, said in an interview.A different set of issues complicates the efforts to return the Abacha money to Nigeria, a case that has dragged on for decades as various people have asserted claims on the money. As the courts have steadily dismissed those claims, the Justice Department has drawn closer to repatriating the money.A group called Serap, which stands for the Socio-Economic Rights Accountability Project, has asked that the money to be given to a \u201creliable U.S. or Nigerian charitable organization\u201d and not returned to the government. \u201cThere is the hope that if the money is placed in the right hands it will be used more efficiently,\u201d said Alexander Sierck, a Washington lawyer and counsel to Serap.Many Nigerians say statements like that, however well intended, smack of colonialism. Instead, they say that the money was theirs in the first place and that the country\u2019s leaders \u2014 and not an outside person or group \u2014 should decide how it is spent. The Nigerian government agrees.This line of argument has become stronger as falling oil prices have hurt the country\u2019s economy and a new president has pledged to eradicate corruption. In May last year at an anticorruption conference in London, Nigeria\u2019s newly elected president, Muhammadu Buhari, said, \u201cWhat I am demanding is the return of the assets.\u201dAn article last Sunday about efforts by the United States government to seize assets from corrupt officials gave an outdated title for Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue of Equatorial Guinea, who has agreed to give up valuables he amassed in the United States. He is now the country\u2019s vice president, no longer the second vice president. (He is the son of the nation\u2019s president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Talks Could Stretch 10 Years, British Official Warns", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Struck off the guest list for dinner at a European Union summit, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, faced a second embarrassment on Thursday, over warnings that trade talks on quitting the bloc could last a decade, and even then might fail.Despite the June 23 referendum decision to leave the European Union, Britain remains a full member until the end of negotiations on British exit, known as Brexit, which Mrs. May aims to complete by the spring of 2019.Britain\u2019s ambiguous, and increasingly isolated, position was underscored by the format for the gathering in Brussels on Thursday in which the other 27 leaders were to debate their own strategy for Brexit over dinner \u2014 and without Mrs. May.The awkwardness Mrs. May faced when she was politely asked to leave the room was compounded by a leaked warning from her own top aide in Brussels, highlighting the mind-numbing complexity of undoing four decades of European integration.According to the BBC, the advice, given to ministers in October by Ivan Rogers, Britain\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, suggested that completing talks on a new trade relationship with the bloc could take 10 years \u2014 and even then might not survive a process of ratification by each of the 27 other nations.Mrs. May\u2019s office did not deny the substance of the report, but said that the ambassador was reflecting the views of other member countries, not his own assessment of the situation.In the meantime, Britons remain fiercely divided over Brexit, with supporters encouraged by the fact that the economy has so far not suffered the dire fate predicted by some ahead of the referendum. Their opponents say the negative effects will become visible next year, after being delayed by the post-referendum stimulus injected into the economy by the Bank of England and a competitive edge gained by the depreciation of the pound sterling.While some of those who favor Brexit fret that they could be cheated of their referendum victory, many businesses worry about the apparent lack of a coherent government strategy, almost six months after the referendum.Their big fear is that two years of negotiation will fail to yield a trade deal, leading to a \u201ccliff edge\u201d plan in which import and export tariffs are applied with little time to prepare.On Wednesday David Davis, the minister responsible for negotiating British exit, suggested that a transitional arrangement might be possible to overcome the risk of such economic disruption, providing that the broad outlines of the final deal are settled by the end of the two-year period.\u201cIf you build a bridge, you need to have both sides established before you build the bridge,\u201d he told lawmakers, while adding that it was \u201cperfectly possible to know what the end game will be in two years.\u201dAlongside the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, Mr. Davis is emerging as a more pragmatic force in the internal British cabinet discussions, for example, keeping open the option that Britain might be willing to continue making some budget contributions to the bloc after Brexit, in exchange for privileges.More surprisingly, Mr. Davis also referred to the possibility that Britain might, legally, be able to revoke its decision to quit the European Union, once it had ignited exit talks under Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s treaty \u2014 though he added that this was not something he anticipated. Until now, the government has argued that once started, the process could not be reversed.Inside the British government, civil servants are working frantically to assess the potential economic impact of Brexit on different sectors of the economy, as their political masters struggle to assemble a strategy for Brexit talks.So far Britain has not said formally that it wants to leave the European Union\u2019s customs union, which provides for tariff-free trade, or its single market, which removes non-tariff barriers, and Mrs. May argues that there need be no \u201cbinary choice\u201d between being on the inside or the outside.Last week the government promised that it would present its outline plan for Brexit to lawmakers before the exit negotiations are triggered. But on Wednesday Mr. Davis said that this would not emerge before February.Moreover, it remains unclear whether this plan will yield real detail, or merely present a wishful opening bid that suggests Britain could jettison the things it dislikes about the European Union, such as the free movement of people, while keeping free trade in goods and services, for important sectors at least. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, once articulated this view, arguing that \u201cmy policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\u201dThat notion has been rejected by a variety of European politicians, including Mr. Barnier and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, both of whom have warned that Britain will not be allowed to cherry pick.There were some early signs of discord Thursday on the European Union side, with the European Parliament\u2019s main negotiator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, threatening to start parallel talks with Britain unless his institution is given a greater role in the Brexit talks.On the substance of the negotiations, the national governments of the 27 are trying to close ranks. In June, soon after the referendum, they declared that any agreement concluded with Britain \u201cwill have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations,\u201d and that \u201caccess to the single market requires acceptance of all four freedoms,\u201d which include the free movement of people as well as goods, capital and services. A similar refrain was expected to emerge Thursday from the informal dinner meeting of the 27.That sets the stage for the difficult negotiations predicted by Mr. Rogers. On Thursday his former colleague, Gus O\u2019Donnell, once Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant, and now a member of the House of Lords, supported that assessment, telling the BBC that it would take \u201cat least five years,\u201d to reach a final deal.Asked if he agreed that a transitional arrangement would be needed to smooth Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc, Mr. O\u2019Donnell replied: \u201cI think that\u2019s a statement of the completely, blindingly, obvious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building a Community, and an Empire, With a Gay Dating App in China", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBEIJING \u2014 Ma Baoli was accustomed to secrets.By day, he was a police officer in northern China with a wife and a knack for street chases. By night, he led a life as a gay man, furtively running a website for gay people across China at a time when many were viewed as criminals and deviants.For 16 years, Mr. Ma kept his secret, worried that coming out would mean expulsion from the police force and estrangement from his family. Then in 2012, his superiors at a police department in Qinhuangdao, a coastal city in Hebei Province, uncovered his website and he resigned.Mr. Ma, 39, said he saw his mission as working to legitimize same-sex relationships at a time when gay people, especially in China, still face discrimination.\u201cIn the past people wouldn\u2019t even talk about homosexuality because they thought it was dirty, it was filthy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe internet can help support gay lifestyles, to make people know they are not alone and that their feelings are genuine.\u201dMr. Ma also sees a lucrative business opportunity in China\u2019s so-called pink economy, as more people look to spend money on gay-themed social networking sites, entertainment and travel. The spending power of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in China is estimated at $460 billion per year, making them the largest market in Asia, according to LGBT Capital, an investment management firm.But translating Mr. Ma\u2019s instincts into an enduring business model has proved challenging. Like many popular technology start-ups in China, Blued is only beginning to make a profit; most of its services, including chat, live-streaming and a news feed, are free. Attracting advertising remains difficult, with some companies reluctant to be associated with a business that caters to gay people.Growing up in northern China as the son of a factory worker and a housewife, Mr. Ma hoped to go to college and become a teacher. But his parents thought his dreams were too costly, and he was sent to the local police academy instead.It was there, he said, in a macho culture that revolved around talking about women, that he realized he was gay.At the time, in the mid-1990s, gay sex was considered a crime in China and homosexuality was classified as a psychological disorder. At the police academy, Mr. Ma took courses on criminal psychology where cadets were told that gay people should be viewed suspiciously because they were more likely to commit crimes.\u201cWhen I realized I was different from other people,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI thought I was ill.\u201dMr. Ma turned to the internet for advice. But instead of finding a supportive community, he found rants describing gay people as lunatics and perverts. On health websites, he was bombarded with recommendations to seek medication and electroshock treatment.At work, Mr. Ma chased burglars, filed incident reports and recorded public service announcements. In his spare time, he raced to the keyboard, writing essays for Danlan and chatting with friends under the pseudonym Geng Le.Mr. Ma kept up the routine for more than a decade. He married, under pressure from friends and family. But when his supervisors confronted him about his website in 2012, he offered his resignation. His family was devastated.\u201cBoth of his parents were very traditional, and they thought their kid had a really good job,\u201d said Wu Guoxin, 38, a friend from the police academy. \u201cThere was nothing he could do.\u201dMr. Ma\u2019s relationship with his wife soon dissolved. His mother was stricken with cancer and Mr. Ma worried that his decision to come out had contributed to her illness. The family agreed to never speak about his sexuality again.IN his new life as a high-powered technology executive, Mr. Ma still goes by the alias from his Danlan days, Geng Le. In meetings with business partners, he retains the deliberative demeanor of a police officer, nodding his head intently in silence, as if interviewing a witness at a crime scene.In a sprawling office in central Beijing, where portraits of scantily clad men hang on the wall, Mr. Ma leads a team of about 200 employees. In one corner, workers scan Blued posts for illegal pornography. In another, a team adds Chinese subtitles to a movie that Blued produced in Thailand.The company is trying to increase its revenue by expanding into gay travel and entertainment.Mr. Ma also hopes to bring more advertising to the app, and he sees potential for growth in live-streaming features, a wildly popular form of communication in China. Blued has more than 200,000 hosts who broadcast around the clock on a variety of topics \u2014 music, dating, fitness and cooking. Some earn up to $15,000 a month in tips paid by users, the company says, with Blued taking a share of each payment.As he works to build his business, Mr. Ma said he was also looking for ways to improve the lives of gay people in China. Blued offers free H.I.V. testing at clinics in Beijing, and the company has helped pay to fly same-sex couples to the United States to be married.Mr. Ma said he was optimistic that long-entrenched stereotypes were fading in China and that within two decades, the country would embrace ideas like same-sex marriage.\u201cWhen I\u2019m at my most painful moments,\u201d he said, \u201cI remember what Jack Ma said: \u2018Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.\u2019 \u201dOwen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Looks Awfully Expensive Since the Trump Rally", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsA new president won\u2019t take office for another month, but the financial markets\u2019 early verdict on the Donald J. Trump era is in, and it is straightforward.They are saying the Trump administration will be good for corporate profits, and hence the stock market is way up. (The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is up 6 percent since Election Day). It will also mean higher interest rates and inflation over time. (The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen to 2.6 percent from 1.85 percent in the same span.)But the result of those two shifts should make anyone thinking of investing in the stock market nervous. You\u2019d be counting on the profit-boosting elements of the Trump agenda being enacted and the profit-hampering possibilities not materializing. Another way to think about it: Putting money into the stock market right now means accepting less compensation for taking on risk than was available before Election Day.Consider a simplified, stylized version of the choice that all investors face as they choose between the two most common types of financial assets, stocks and bonds. Suppose you have $1,000 to invest over the next 10 years. If you buy one of the aforementioned 10-year Treasury bonds, you\u2019ll get exactly 2.6 percent of $1,000, or $26, each year for 10 years. Then you\u2019ll get your $1,000 back.If you instead buy $1,000 worth of stocks, you\u2019re buying a flow of income that is much less certain. Right now, the earnings of the S.& P. 500 index amount to 4.7 percent of the value of the index (that\u2019s the earnings-to-price ratio, the inverse of the more widely followed price-to-earnings ratio). So if you buy stocks, you\u2019re figuring that you are buying $47 worth of annual income initially. But that\u2019s a number that could either rise or fall over the coming decade before you look to sell.When you try to determine whether stocks or bonds are more attractive, what matters is how those rates compare to each other and what you expect to happen to corporate earnings in the future. Most of the time, investors demand compensation for taking on the risk of buying volatile, unpredictable stocks.On Election Day, for example, the earnings yield on stocks was 5 percent, and the Treasury bond yield was 1.85 percent, meaning that investors were compensated with an extra 3.15 percentage points on their money for taking the risk of putting it into the stock market.The moves since the election \u2014 higher stock prices and lower bond prices \u2014 have narrowed that gap to only 2.17 percentage points at Friday\u2019s close. The amount of compensation you get for the risk of investing in stocks has fallen by a third in the last six weeks. (The gap has come down a great deal in the last five years as stock prices have risen a lot faster than corporate earnings.)Now, there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d level for this risk compensation. It was lower than it is now throughout the mid-2000s, and was even persistently in negative territory during the late 1990s (though that was in the midst of a stock market bubble). The question at any given moment is whether there is a good justification for the size of that gap.The financial markets\u2019 take on the Trump economy is that it will be good for corporate profitability. A cut in corporate income taxes, a key part of the Trump campaign\u2019s tax plan, would accrue straight to businesses\u2019 bottom line. A lighter touch on regulations should mean companies in regulated sectors like banks and energy companies would become more profitable. If there is a large-scale infrastructure program as Mr. Trump has proposed, it will be good news for companies that supply the heavy construction industry.But the weird thing since the election has been investors\u2019 willingness to price in all the stuff that is good news for corporate earnings while seemingly ignoring the elements that are less welcome for businesses\u2019 bottom line.The dollar is up about 5 percent against a basket of other major currencies since the election, a shift that will damage the earnings of firms with a large international business. The rise in interest rates could hurt sales in rate-sensitive sectors like automobiles and housing. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent, which suggests employers will have to pay more to attract and keep workers in the year ahead.And that\u2019s not even to mention the more speculative risks that could come from a Trump administration. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs and pledged to disrupt trade arrangements that form the very underpinnings of modern global capitalism. If his erratic approach to diplomacy leads to geopolitical conflict, that probably won\u2019t be good for most businesses\u2019 bottom lines.If, like most people, you\u2019re a long-term buy-and-hold investor, it doesn\u2019t make sense to try to time the market by moving money into or out of stocks based on the latest headlines. After all, the more positive view of the outlook for big business could well turn out to be right.But it\u2019s worth keeping your eyes wide open about the risk stock investors are taking, the limited compensation they\u2019re getting for it, and the real possibilities that things could turn out differently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Sees a Happy New Year", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCHICAGO \u2014 These days President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cannot hide his glee. This is unusual for a man trained to deceive and mislead, a man who is practiced in his profession. In an interview with the Russian television program \u201cWeekly News\u201d on Dec. 4, Mr. Putin said it was obvious that the West had failed to create a unipolar world and that balance was being restored. He had reasons to feel triumphant: His years of supporting anti-establishment movements in the West, mostly on the right, by hacking and leaking private information, spreading fake news and financing parties and individuals ready to do the Kremlin\u2019s bidding all seem to be paying off.Russia\u2019s methods are hardly new. Remember, for example, \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of the Zion,\u201d a notorious forgery concocted by the czar\u2019s secret police and published in Russia in 1903. Purporting to describe a Jewish plot to dominate the world, it became a bible for anti-Semites everywhere and was widely used by the Nazis. Throughout the 20th century, disinformation and propaganda disseminated by the Communist Party\u2019s Department of Propaganda and Agitation, alongside its intelligence services, became part and parcel of the Soviet regime. During the Soviet-Finnish war in the winter of 1939, for instance, as Soviet planes bombed the Finns, the Soviet foreign minister, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, said Moscow was dropping humanitarian aid \u2014 food and water. In response to the lie, the Finns sarcastically named their own bombs \u2014 bottles filled with flammable fuel \u2014 Molotov cocktails.In post-Soviet Russia, the same cynical mendacity has become the Putin government\u2019s hallmark. On July 9, 2014, in a meeting with public leaders at the Kremlin, Mr. Putin referred to Joseph Goebbels, the notorious Nazi minister of propaganda, as \u201ca talented man who knew that the more incredible the lies, the quicker people believe them.\u201d The quote, which he was using to condemn the West\u2019s supposed misrepresentation of Russian history, was in fact the best indication of Mr. Putin\u2019s own creed.Now, in addition to undermining the legitimacy of the American presidential election campaign, Russia has been a frequent source of fake news that targeted the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, during a recent referendum and muddled a Swedish debate last summer about joining NATO.Throughout Eastern Europe, Moscow has been implicated in cyberattacks and election interference from Estonia to Bulgaria. Germany, which will hold elections in September, is experiencing cyberattacks and fake news.Even more surprising than Russia\u2019s aggressive behavior has been the timid response of the West, which has let Moscow engage in cyberwarfare with impunity. President Obama said this month that during their meeting last September, he told Mr. Putin \u201cto cut it out.\u201d That hardly sounds like a president concerned with a grave threat to American democracy. His warning to Mr. Putin may have forestalled even more brazen Russian attacks, but enough damage had already been done. In Italy, Mr. Renzi\u2019s campaign privately complained about Russia\u2019s interference but declined to go public. And when Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, was asked on Nov. 27 about Russian meddling in Germany\u2019s electoral campaign, she replied, \u201cWe just have to learn to live with it.\u201dTo live with it? This is not routine cyber intelligence, which many nations practice. Russia\u2019s cyber activity seeks to confuse, destabilize and ultimately bring to power foreign governments pliant to Russia\u2019s aims. That is an attack on the values and institutions of democratic societies, and, if successful, it achieves the same result as a military invasion to install a new government.In his recent interview on Russian television, the Kremlin\u2019s chief propagandist, Dmitri Kiselev, stated it in bald, cynical terms: \u201cToday it is much more costly to kill one enemy soldier than during World War II, World War I or in the Middle Ages,\u201d adding that \u201cif you can persuade a person, you don\u2019t need to kill him.\u201dThe Russian military views an information war as part of its military doctrine, and Americans need to consider Russia\u2019s cyber activities as an act of war that requires a forceful and united response. President Obama\u2019s response \u2014 at least until now \u2014 has proved inadequate.Unlike the Cold War, this one has no Iron Curtain and no ideological battleground. In this new hybrid warfare, former K.G.B. men have become oligarchs, Mr. Putin refers to Western nations as \u201cpartners,\u201d and the government sells stakes in state companies to Western businesses and relies on Western markets and other financial institutions. Yet behind the smoke and mirrors, Russia remains a Potemkin village that hides a police state and an expansionist empire, steeped in systemic corruption and governed by up-to-date techniques of repression and manipulation.This, too, is not new for Russia. Unhindered by public opinion, laws and opposition political parties, Russia\u2019s autocrats have historically derived strength from territorial expansion and geopolitical aggrandizement. Starting with Ivan the Terrible, the Russian empire expanded for at least five centuries \u2014 by some calculations annexing each year territory the size of Belgium \u2014 until the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991. That dramatic denouement is what Mr. Putin is desperately trying to reverse, resorting to the same tool kit used by Soviet leaders since the formative days of the Soviet state in the early 1920s. At that time a destitute and hungry Russia was recovering from revolution and civil war. Still, the Bolshevik government spared no resources when it came to propaganda and repression.Mr. Putin\u2019s greatest success has been to help place in the White House a man who shares many of his values and seems happy to do his bidding. But Mr. Putin is not done yet. He seeks to promote anti-establishment candidates in next year\u2019s elections in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany. If this new cold war comes to an end with a Putin-Trump alliance, it will do so on Russia\u2019s terms, with Russia no more democratic and the United States becoming a little more like Russia.Next October will mark a century since the Bolsheviks violently seized power. That first totalitarian regime, in which Mr. Putin would later be trained, arguably provoked the rise of other political movements that together defined the rest of the 20th century, leading to unprecedented political violence and wars that took the lives of tens of millions.We simply cannot allow Moscow to define the direction of another century by orchestrating a parade of Western democracies on their way to becoming corrupt, autocratic societies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Wonders How Long Netanyahu Can Back Settlements and Two-State Solution", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 For years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a conservative, has played a double act, competing domestically with his right-wing rivals in backing the settlement project all over the occupied West Bank while professing support for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.Naftali Bennett, the leader of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, with whom Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party compete for votes, is goading him to take on more extreme positions like annexing parts of the West Bank, adding to a sense in Israel that the real Mr. Netanyahu may have to stand up and decide which side he is on.\u201cHe has to choose between the international community and Bennett,\u201d said Shlomo Avineri, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cIt is not an easy choice, but he has to make a choice,\u201d Professor Avineri said, adding: \u201cIs Israel going to alienate itself from the whole world for the sake of settlement activity? And it is the whole world. Is this what Zionism is about?\u201d\u201cFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting.Referring to the American secretary of state, Mr. Netanyahu added, \u201cAs I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d and he said he was looking forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump's administration when it takes office next month.The Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors of countries that had voted in favor of the resolution for personal meetings with ministry officials in Jerusalem, despite the Christmas holiday, which some of those countries celebrate.In a highly unusual move, Mr. Netanyahu, who is also the foreign minister, summoned the American ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a meeting on Sunday night.Mr. Netanyahu also instructed his ministers to reduce their diplomatic activities and contacts with counterparts from the countries that had voted for the resolution for the next three weeks, until the American administration changes, and to minimize travel to those countries, according to Israeli news reports.In an additional step, the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, instructed Israel\u2019s agencies to suspend contact with Palestinian Authority representatives on some unspecified civil matters, though the measure was not supposed to affect security coordination or meetings about water, agriculture and the economy.With the Israeli occupation in its 50th year and the peace process frozen, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and the Palestinians\u2019 veteran negotiator, called on Israel \u201cto seize the opportunity, to wake up, to stop the violence, to stop settlements and to resume negotiations.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu says he is ready for negotiations anytime, but with no preconditions.The Security Council vote seemed to have caught Israel off guard.\u201cI hope for Netanyahu\u2019s sake (and also for ours) that he knows the truth at least deep in his heart \u2014 it was the chronicle of a failure foretold,\u201d Ben Caspit, a political commentator, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Sunday.Mr. Netanyahu and his attorney general had warned that the bill, which recently passed a first reading in Parliament, contravenes international law and could land Israeli officials in the defendant dock of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\u201cAfter he said it, he rushed to vote in favor of the bill. Why?\u201d Mr. Caspit wrote. \u201cBecause of Bennett. The fear of the possibility that he would not be able to siphon seats from Bennett next time on Election Day caused him to act like a small-time grocery owner, instead of a national leader.\u201dEven Haggai Segal, a prominent settler and the editor in chief of a right-wing newspaper, Makor Rishon, wrote in recent months that the Regulation Bill had \u201cno chance\u201d because it would be invalidated by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court and would be used by the International Criminal Court \u201cto incriminate Israel for war crimes.\u201dMr. Segal, who served jail time as a member of the Jewish Underground that maimed and killed Palestinians in the 1980s, wrote this summer, \u201cThe wise thing now is to make do with what it is possible to do, and not lose it all by insisting on impossible goals.\u201dMr. Bennett did not seem deterred. In a statement to reporters on Sunday at the Western Wall in the Old City in East Jerusalem, Mr. Bennett said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to decide between two alternatives: surrendering our land or sovereignty.\u201d He added that steps would be taken in the near future to try to apply Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, the biblical terms for the West Bank.But some Israelis were skeptical that Mr. Netanyahu, in his third consecutive term in office, and fourth over all, would choose one side over the other.\u201cBennett knows that Netanyahu is not going to make a decision,\u201d said Shmuel Sandler, a professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe may say he will go with both. So far, it worked. It is easier for Bennett because he is not the prime minister. Netanyahu wants to enjoy both of the worlds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Should Know: This Is What Climate Change Costs Us", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIf that happens, it will defy law, science and economics.In 2009, the two of us \u2014 one from the Council of Economic Advisers and the other from the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 convened the first meetings of the working group to which the questionnaire referred. Our aim was to quantify the social cost of carbon for the United States government by drawing from the latest research in science and economics. This comprehensive measure would reflect the monetary cost of the damage caused by the release of an additional ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, accounting for the destruction of property from storms and floods, declining agricultural and labor productivity, elevated mortality rates and more.Without it, such regulations would have no quantifiable benefits. For this reason, the social cost of carbon can be seen as the linchpin of national climate policy.And yet not everyone is a fan of this concept. Those who think that climate change is a hoax, or who oppose regulation as a rule, have a major problem with the social cost of carbon, because it indicates that limits on emissions can deliver significant benefits. Others believe that the $36 per ton figure is too high, overstating the benefits of regulations.The court responded that it had \u201cno doubt that Congress intended\u201d to allow consideration of the social cost of carbon and that the government\u2019s judgments were reasonable.To be sure, the exact number is uncertain, and the Trump administration will make its own judgment. But a credible assessment must be based on the best science and economics, not politics. And there is no justification for a chilling investigation of civil servants who are just doing their jobs.Ultimately, the social cost of carbon provides a necessary guidepost in decisions about how to balance costs to our economy today with the coming climate damages. Wishing that we did not face this trade-off will not make it go away.Any effort to eliminate the social cost of carbon would reflect a neglect of science and economics \u2014 and it would be quickly struck down in court.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Carolina Governor Signs Law Limiting Successor\u2019s Power", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Amid a tense and dramatic backdrop of outrage and frustration, North Carolina\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature on Friday approved a sweeping package of restrictions on the power of the governor\u2019s office in advance of the swearing in of the Democratic governor-elect, Roy Cooper.Protesters spent a second day chanting and disrupting debate, as some were arrested and led away from the state legislative building in plastic wrist restraints.Democratic lawmakers repeatedly referred to the move as a \u201cpower grab\u201d carried out by a Republican Party upset that their candidate, Gov. Pat McCrory, had lost the governor\u2019s race. Republicans countered by emphasizing that they had suffered similar indignities for many decades when Democrats controlled the legislature here.State Senator Chad Barefoot, a Republican, said that the changes return \u201cpower that was grabbed during Democratic administrations in the 1990s, and some in the \u201970s.\u201dBut some here said that Republicans\u2019 effort to hobble the incoming governor had few parallels in recent North Carolina history.\u201cSure, the Democrats don\u2019t have clean hands, but this is beyond anything I\u2019ve seen them do,\u201d said Bob Phillips, executive director of the nonpartisan group Common Cause North Carolina. \u201cI think we\u2019re in unprecedented, uncharted territory with this.\u201dTwo major bills were approved by the legislature Friday. One of them, which was quickly signed by the departing Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, strips future governors of their power to appoint a majority to the State Board of Elections. The number of board members was expanded from five to eight, with the eight members to be evenly divided between the two major parties.It also changes the state court system, making it more difficult for the losers of some superior court cases to appeal directly to the Democratic-controlled Supreme Court.A second bill, which had not been signed by the governor as of Friday afternoon, strips the governor of his ability to name members of the boards of state universities, and it reduces the number of state employees the governor can appoint from 1,500 to 425.Republicans, who once expanded the number of employees who serve at the governor\u2019s pleasure in an effort to help Mr. McCrory, originally proposed shrinking the number of such workers to 300 in advance of Mr. Cooper\u2019s inauguration. The number was increased in an amendment filed by Mr. Barefoot.In another change, and one that could have the greatest impact in the near term, the bill makes the governor\u2019s cabinet appointees subject to approval by the State Senate. Republicans currently enjoy veto-proof majorities in the House and the Senate, and the North Carolina governorship is historically a relatively weak office. Cabinet appointments are one of the major ways Mr. Cooper, a moderate Democrat, might be able to influence the direction of the state.The moves have mobilized North Carolina\u2019s sizable Democratic contingent, who have been galvanized, over the last four years, by the \u201cMoral Mondays\u201d protest movement led by the Rev. William Barber II, the charismatic president of the state N.A.A.C.P.On Friday afternoon, Mr. Barber entered the state legislative building, triggering whoops and cheers from the roughly 200 protesters.With the aid of a cane he made his way into the space outside the legislative chambers, and encouraged the protesters to risk arrest by knocking on the locked doors of the State House viewing gallery. Police had forbidden protesters to knock.\u201cYou have to decide if you want to in fact knock on that door,\u201d said Mr. Barber.Some knocked. A number of them were arrested. The building throbbed as the protesters chanted, \u201cLet Us In.\u201dThe raucous protests Friday, and the votes along strict party lines, virtually guarantee that hyperpartisan political turmoil will continue to be the norm in this deeply divided state. Democratic protests began to swell here in 2013, after Mr. McCrory took office, and Republicans, enjoying control of both the executive and legislative branches, began rolling out an aggressive conservative agenda that limited ballot access and, with the passage of the legislation known as House Bill 2, curtailed gay and transgender rights.In a news conference Thursday, Mr. Cooper, the state\u2019s veteran attorney general, threatened to sue the legislature over the changes. \u201cOnce more, the courts will have to clean up the mess the legislature made, but it won\u2019t stop us from moving North Carolina forward,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday.Friday\u2019s debates at times found Republicans arguing that they could make the changes, and Democrats questioning whether they should. Mr. Barefoot, on the Senate floor, argued forcefully that a number of the changes were well within the Republicans\u2019 legal rights, citing specific passages from the state Constitution.State Senator Joyce Waddell, a Democrat from Mecklenburg County, echoed many other Democrats when she complained that the matters were being decided in a hastily called special session that allowed less opportunity for public input than normal.\u201cWhy are we rushing?\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to hear from voters.\u201dRepublicans defended some of the moves as good-government reform efforts. Representative David R. Lewis, argued that the provision changing the elections boards will instill greater confidence in the electoral process. In addition to changing the state board, the law will also make the state\u2019s 100 county elections boards four-member bodies evenly split between the two parties. Before, they were set up so that the governor\u2019s party had a 2-1 majority in each.\u201cWe have been told that one of the most important things is for our citizenry to have confidence and faith that the elections process is fair,\u201d Mr. Lewis said, \u201cand that it is overseen in a way that does not reflect the partisan bent, if you will, of those administering the elections.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Speaks With Taiwan\u2019s Leader, an Affront to China", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with Taiwan\u2019s president on Friday, a striking break with nearly four decades of diplomatic practice that could precipitate a major rift with China even before Mr. Trump takes office.Mr. Trump\u2019s office said he had spoken with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, \u201cwho offered her congratulations.\u201d He is believed to be the first president or president-elect who has spoken to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979, when the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People\u2019s Republic of China.In the statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s office said the two leaders had noted \u201cthe close economic, political, and security ties\u201d between Taiwan and the United States. Mr. Trump, it said, \u201calso congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.\u201dOn Saturday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in his government\u2019s first official reaction, played down the call.Stressing the good relationship between the United States and China, he said, \u201cI also believe this will not change the One China policy upheld by the American government for many years.\u201dMr. Wang, speaking to reporters in Beijing, characterized the call as initiated by the Taiwanese government. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a petty action by the Taiwan side.\u201dThe White House was not told about Mr. Trump\u2019s call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter.The longer-term fallout from the Trump-Tsai conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a well-established arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing.Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has adamantly opposed the attempts of any country to carry on official relations with it.Initial reaction from China about Friday\u2019s telephone call was surprise verging on disbelief. \u201cThis is a big event, the first challenge the president-elect has made to China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThis must be bad news for the Chinese leadership.\u201dOfficial state-run media have portrayed Mr. Trump in a positive light, casting him as a businessman China could get along with. He was favored among Chinese commentators during the election over Hillary Clinton, who was perceived as being too hard on China.Mr. Trump\u2019s exchange touched \u201cthe most sensitive spot\u201d for China\u2019s foreign policy, Mr. Shi said. The government, he said, would most likely interpret it as encouraging Ms. Tsai, the leader of the party that favors independence from the mainland, to continue to resist pressure from Beijing.Among diplomats in the United States, there was similar shock. \u201cThis is a change of historic proportions,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior director of Asian affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cThe real question is, what are the Chinese going to do?\u201dTies between the United States and Taiwan are currently managed through quasi-official institutions. The American Institute in Taiwan issues visas and provides other basic consular services, and Taiwan has an equivalent institution with offices in several cities in the United States.These arrangements are the outgrowth of the One China policy that has governed relations between the United States and China since President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s historic meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of China, abrogating its ties with Taipei a year later.The call also raised questions of conflicts of interest.Ms. Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Obama took the action on national security grounds, after an intelligence review concluded that the technology could be used for \u201cmilitary applications\u201d and help provide an \u201coverall technical body of knowledge and experience\u201d to the Chinese.The decision is likely to accelerate tension with Beijing, as Chinese authorities make it extraordinarily difficult for American technology companies, including Google and Facebook, to gain access to the Chinese market, and Washington seeks to slow China\u2019s acquisition of critical technology.By happenstance, just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai, Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who designed the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, was in Beijing meeting with Mr. Xi. It was unclear if Mr. Kissinger, 93, was carrying any message from Mr. Trump, with whom he met again recently in his role as the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy sage.\u201cThe presidential election has taken place in the United States and we are now in the key moment. We, on the Chinese side, are watching the situation very closely. Now it is in the transition period,\u201d Mr. Xi told Mr. Kissinger in front of reporters.A small, hard-line faction of Republicans has periodically urged a more confrontational approach to Beijing, and many of President George W. Bush\u2019s advisers were pressing such an approach in the first months of his presidency in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11 defused that move, and Iraq became the No. 1 enemy. After that, Mr. Bush needed China \u2014 for North Korea diplomacy, counterterrorism and as an economic partner \u2014 and any movement toward confrontation was quashed.This week, Mr. Trump appeared to accept an invitation from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit Pakistan, a country that Mr. Obama has steered clear of, largely over tensions between Washington and Islamabad over counterterrorism policy and nuclear proliferation.Reporting was contributed by Jane Perlez from Beijing, Michael Forsythe from Hong Kong, and Eric Lipton and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s approach to antitrust laws stands out for its importance. Mr. Trump gained a lot of voter support because of the stagnation of working-class living standards in the face of record corporate profits.But the real challenge to competitive markets today does not come from mergers like this one. The great, but mostly unknown, antitrust story of our time is the astonishing rise of the institutional investor \u2014 a large company, like a mutual fund company, insurance company, pension fund or asset management firm, that buys stock in substantial quantities for the benefit of clients and customers \u2014 and the challenge that it poses to market competition.Economic theory tells us that when a single investor owns large stakes in competing firms, the investor will want firms to keep prices high and wages low. Price and wage competition lowers profits and stock values.Will Mr. Trump fight for the interests of the working-class voters who brought him to power? Our approach would raise living standards while making American companies more competitive.If the new administration\u2019s antitrust enforcers ignore this chance to follow through on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises, voters should hold him to account.Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

Even the title alludes to those roots: Dalai means \u201cocean\u201d in Mongolian.China has long pressured countries, including Western ones, to ban visits from the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. Chinese Communist Party leaders consider him to be an enemy who advocates Tibetan independence from China, although the Dalai Lama has said he seeks only greater autonomy for Tibetans.In one sense, Mongolia\u2019s reaction to China, a neighbor that has the world\u2019s second-largest economy, was predictable. Mongolia is dealing with financial problems and is seeking a large loan from Beijing. Until a recent crash, the Mongolian economy had been growing fast, fueled by mineral extraction.But, at the same time, Mongolia has tried to distance itself from China and Russia, and has become a United States military partner.It is also a traditionally Buddhist country with ancient ties to Tibetan Buddhism and to the history of the Dalai Lamas, and the foreign minister\u2019s remarks alarmed some historians and Tibet advocates.The Dalai Lamas arose from the actions of Altan Khan, a 16th-century Mongolian leader who controlled a region next to northern China, which was ruled by the ethnic Han emperors of the Ming dynasty.Three centuries earlier, Kublai Khan, the founding emperor of the Yuan dynasty, an era when Mongolians ruled China, had become interested in Tibetan Buddhism and had taken on a Tibetan teacher.This bound the Mongols and Tibetans and established a relationship between Mongolian rulers and the Gelug school. Since then, the position of the Dalai Lama has been tied to complex politics in Asia. The two heads of the Gelug school preceding the one who visited Altan Khan were also given the Dalai Lama title retroactively.But the Dalai Lama\u2019s recent visit suggests to some scholars that Mongolia could be the place to watch, especially given the history of the Third and Fourth Dalai Lamas.\u201cThe interesting thing about the Dalai Lama visit was that it may be a signal that his reincarnation could appear there,\u201d Mr. Barnett said. He added that given China\u2019s hostility, this is \u201csomething that would be potentially disastrous for Mongolia.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Taoyuan is the center of a metropolitan area with over two million residents.Ms. Chen\u2019s visit was followed in October by a work-related visit to Taipei by a Trump Organization employee.

Her house in Akim Oda, a small town in southern Ghana, was filled with well-wishers. I walked into the kitchen to fetch drinks for the guests, and as I opened the fridge, the lights flickered out.\u201cOooh, light off!\u201d my aunt called out from the living room. Electricity in the entire town had gone out; it did not return until midday the next day, right before I returned to Accra, the capital. \u201cSurely, we can\u2019t take much more of this,\u201d I thought on the drive back.The new government, which will take over in January, has a number of options. Chief among these are injecting significant capital into the electricity sector and accelerating the building of power plants. These are not quick fixes, however, and they require patience from the public \u2014 which is in short supply here.In response, the Electricity Company of Ghana, the primary national distributor, began an aggressive \u201cload shedding\u201d program: During periods of high demand, electricity to various parts of the country is shut off to avoid a nationwide blackout.\u201cDumsor,\u201d as the situation is popularly known, is a colloquialism that translates to \u201coff-on,\u201d a reference to the regular shut-offs. It showed up everywhere: in pop culture, on social media and, eventually, at the polls.To meet ever rising demand, Ghana needs to get more independent power producers that use both thermal and renewable sources of energy \u2014 and fast.This won\u2019t be easy. Taking a power plant from project development to commercial operation requires several years. You can\u2019t force such a task to fit within the constraints of a four-year election cycle. There is no guarantee the public will be understanding when the next general election comes around in 2020.There are several power projects in the works that could potentially be brought up to speed within a relatively short period. However, these projects were awarded by the departing government, and the new government may be hesitant to allow them to proceed if it means enriching its political opponents.Meanwhile, the crisis persists. Two weeks ago, my neighborhood in Accra endured a rolling blackout. Time is not on Mr. Akufo-Addo\u2019s side. His toughest job, therefore, will be to manage expectations. He can start by clearly articulating a plan with a realistic time frame.But his administration also must raise money and get the private sector to invest in the electricity industry. Additionally, the new government should review and hurry along existing power projects, while it phases out inefficient subsidies in the electricity sector. It also needs to make the Electricity Company of Ghana start using dynamic pricing (charging more for electricity during peak hours) to manage demand.If Mr. Akufo-Addo fails to resolve Ghana\u2019s power crisis by the end of his four-year term, he can expect to make a call to a replacement president very similar to the one he received this month from the out-going president.Kwaku O.

This would help keep immigrant families together, improve public safety for all by promoting trust in local law enforcement, and protect New York\u2019s overall economy and tax base, which relies heavily on immigrant labor and immigrant consumers.Finally, our state should expand access to driver\u2019s licenses to all New York motorists regardless of immigration status, a common-sense public safety measure that has already been adopted by California and a dozen other states.CARLOS MENCHACAChairman, Immigration CommitteeNew York City CouncilNew YorkAdvertisement"}

During the campaign, Mr. Trump called the nuclear agreement \u201ca bad deal\u201d that he promised to \u201ctear up.\u201dAs Mr. Rouhani posed the question, the audience began chanting, \u201cDeath to America.\u201dIn the speech, which was delivered at Tehran University and televised nationally, Mr. Rouhani maintained that \u201cAmerica cannot influence our determination, this nation\u2019s resistance and its struggle.\u201dHe continued: \u201cAmerica is our enemy; we have no doubt about this. The Americans want to put as much pressure on us as they can.\u201dFor Mr. Rouhani, who until recently seemed set to be elected for a second term in May, the change in fortune is a threat to his political career, analysts say.\u201cTrump is far worse than his predecessor,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst. \u201cRouhani has proven that trusting America is useless and a waste of time, energy and money. He should not be re-elected.\u201dMr. Rouhani had promised an economic renaissance after the 2015 deal, which led to the lifting of most of the sanctions that had been crippling the Iranian economy in exchange for the mothballing of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.But that has not materialized, thanks to remaining sanctions over Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and terrorism, as well as lingering fears among Western companies about incurring American penalties for doing business with Iran.During his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Rouhani, apparently trying to fend off the attacks, emphasized that ultimately it was the nation\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who had led the negotiations and signed off on the deal.\u201cWe took no step in the issue of the nuclear agreement without consulting the supreme leader,\u201d he said.Ayatollah Khamenei has often criticized the deal publicly, but analysts agree that without his specific consent, a compromise with the United States and other global powers would never have been reached.Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent to power has been met by Mr. Rouhani and other Iranian leaders with familiar slogans like \u201cAmerica can\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d But the vote last week in Washington to extend sanctions for another decade, which they say violated the nuclear agreement, seemed to strike a nerve.\u201cIf the Iran Sanctions Act is carried out, it will be a clear and obvious violation of the agreement and will be met with a very harsh response from us,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said, joining dozens of other clerics, politicians and generals who have made similar threats.Iranian lawmakers have proposed a boycott of American products, but very few are being sold in the country. Some have even suggested restarting nuclear activities and the enrichment of uranium, though they have little or no say over such matters.Pulling out of the deal is not an option for Iran, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. \u201cIran will not be the first to break the agreement,\u201d Bahram Ghasemi, the spokesman, said. \u201cWe will never, and in no way will be the first to make the first step forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seduced and Betrayed by Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump won the Electoral College (though not the popular vote) on the strength of overwhelming support from working-class whites, who feel left behind by a changing economy and society. And they\u2019re about to get their reward \u2014 the same reward that, throughout Mr. Trump\u2019s career, has come to everyone who trusted his good intentions. Think Trump University.Yes, the white working class is about to be betrayed.The first thing you need to understand here is that Republican talk of \u201crepeal and replace\u201d has always been a fraud. The G.O.P. has spent six years claiming that it will come up with a replacement for Obamacare any day now; the reason it hasn\u2019t delivered is that it can\u2019t.Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to: You can\u2019t cover Americans with pre-existing conditions without requiring healthy people to sign up, and you can\u2019t do that without subsidies to make insurance affordable.Any replacement will either look a lot like Obamacare, or take insurance away from millions who desperately need it.What the choice of Mr. Price suggests is that the Trump administration is, in fact, ready to see millions lose insurance. And many of those losers will be Trump supporters.Why did they do it? They may not have realized that their coverage was at stake \u2014 over the course of the campaign, the news media barely covered policy at all. Or they may have believed Mr. Trump\u2019s assurances that he would replace Obamacare with something great.Either way, they\u2019re about to receive a rude awakening, which will get even worse once Republicans push ahead with their plans to end Medicare as we know it, which seem to be on even though the president-elect had promised specifically that he would do no such thing.And just in case you\u2019re wondering, no, Mr. Trump can\u2019t bring back the manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the past few decades. Those jobs were lost mainly to technological change, not imports, and they aren\u2019t coming back.There will be nothing to offset the harm workers suffer when Republicans rip up the safety net.Will there be a political backlash, a surge of buyer\u2019s remorse? Maybe. Certainly Democrats will be well advised to hammer Mr. Trump\u2019s betrayal of the working class nonstop. But we do need to consider the tactics that he will use to obscure the scope of his betrayal.One tactic, which we\u2019ve already seen with this week\u2019s ostentatious announcement of a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in America, will be to distract the nation with bright, shiny, trivial objects. True, this tactic will work only if news coverage is both gullible and innumerate.But judging from the coverage of the deal so far, assuming that the news media will be gullible and innumerate seems like a good bet.And if and when the reality that workers are losing ground starts to sink in, I worry that the Trumpists will do what authoritarian governments often do to change the subject away from poor performance: go find an enemy.Remember what I said about Trump Twitter. Even as he took a big step toward taking health insurance away from millions, Mr. Trump started ranting about taking citizenship away from flag-burners. This was not a coincidence.The point is to keep your eye on what\u2019s important. Millions of Americans have just been sucker-punched. They just don\u2019t know it yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Conquerers: A New 19th-Century History Focuses on American Imperialism", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cI take space to be the central fact to man born in America, from Folsom cave to now,\u201d the great poet Charles Olson wrote in his study of Herman Melville. \u201cI spell it large because it comes large here. Large, and without mercy.\u201d In one way or another, historians of 19th-century America have long grappled with the way space \u2014 whether defined as property, geography or Emersonian nature \u2014 has seized the imagination, and lined the pocketbooks, of slaveholders, colonialists and capitalists.In his comprehensive \u201cA Nation Without Borders: The United States and Its World in an Age of Civil Wars, 1830-1910,\u201d Steven Hahn is no exception, although he provides the most sweeping indictment to date of the American appetite for conquest. A professor of history at New York University and winner of a Pulitzer Prize for \u201cA Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South From Slavery to the Great Migration,\u201d Hahn argues that America developed into a nation precisely because of its obsession with owning space; that is, it sought to become a continental empire, which meant acquiring land and resources, almost at any cost, and dominating sovereign peoples both at home and abroad.Hahn tellingly opens his chronicle of greed on the Texas border. After Gen. Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna failed to crush insurgent Texians (Americans in Tejas), the slaveholding Republic of Texas was shakily established, and though many Texians hoped their republic would be annexed by the United States, neither Mexico nor the United States officially recognized it. What\u2019s more, the Texas border was itself in dispute and as a result, Hahn observes, Texas remained more of \u201can imagined space than a sovereign state, with boundaries that were endlessly porous, ever shifting and almost impossible to discern.\u201dThese porous borders supply Hahn with his central metaphor. Nations possess recognized boundaries, principles and laws over which a central government directly rules. To become a nation, America colonized those peoples who lived within its borders and exacted a high price whenever they tried to retain their cultural or religious traditions. (Consider the federal treatment of Native American tribes.) Yet to Hahn the United States is also an imperialist nation without borders, seeking to expand, to assimilate, to annex or to conquer other nations, sovereignties or peoples, not just in the Western Hemisphere but also in the Pacific. (Consider the American wars against Filipinos as well as Mexicans and Cubans.)In the years after the War of the Rebellion (Hahn avoids the term \u201cCivil War\u201d), the United States became a nation-state as the Army, the states, the courts and Congress built up a vast network of railroads that helped keep labor, as Hahn puts it, \u201cunder their thumbs.\u201d Hahn thus considers the postwar period commonly known as Reconstruction not just as the rocky, often violent conversion of slave into free labor but as the beginning of \u201cnation-state formation,\u201d buttressed by a judiciary that provided capitalism, as he says, with \u201creal traction\u201d in the post-bellum West and South. Most important, philosophical concepts such as individualism or, later, Herbert Spencer\u2019s notion of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d undercut the revolutionary implications of Radical Republicanism. Everyone fending for himself eroded federally mandated civil and political rights, not to mention that scary idea about redistributing Confederate lands to former slaves.Hahn describes how the American nation colonized native peoples within its own borders by deploying military and paramilitary groups \u2014 hired guns and organized lynch parties \u2014 to defeat the \u201coppositional movements\u201d he admires. Of course, in the first half of the 19th century there had been a host of rebellions against federal authority: whether the defiance of native peoples during the Second Seminole War or the attempt of the Mormons to organize their own state in the Utah Territory.But in the years after the War of the Rebellion, and during the Progressive Era, which Hahn labels a period of \u201creconstructions,\u201d a number of \u201cworker mobilizations\u201d challenged capitalist gluttony, federal domination of the Western territories and corporate consolidation. Committed to restoring human dignity to lives and jobs, this array of dissident groups \u2014 and certain individuals within them \u2014 resisted the monopolistic practices of railroads, of industrial capitalism and of corporate behemoths like Standard Oil. They included the \u201cpan-tribal Indianness\u201d that expressed itself in the Ghost Dance movement and the Greenback Labor Party, which hoped to limit the power of financiers. The biracial Knights of Labor called for an eight-hour workday, currency reform and the nationalization of the railroads and utilities. Influencing many of these movements was the point of view of the new European immigrants, many of whom were socialists \u2014 and the inspiration of the short-lived Paris Commune.Hahn goes on to address such topics as Populism; Frederick Winslow Taylor\u2019s theory of scientific management; settlement houses; woman suffrage; and the Supreme Court decisions known as the Insular Cases, which left the people of such annexed territories as Guam and Puerto Rico without full United States citizenship. His assessments are cogent but quick. That is the downside of an ambitious single volume that spans 80 years of nettlesome history and runs to over 500 pages, including an indispensable 50-page bibliography, primarily of secondary sources. (The book is part of the Penguin History of the United States, edited by Eric Foner.) Since he covers so much ground, Hahn helpfully subdivides his chapters into sections with titles like \u201cImperial Eyes,\u201d \u201cLabor\u2019s Coercions,\u201d \u201cThe Blood of Continental Destiny,\u201d \u201cMilitant Arms of Slaveholding Empire,\u201d \u201cThe Jacobin Arm and Peasant Dream,\u201d \u201cWheels of Capital,\u201d \u201cThreads of Discourse\u201d and \u201cImperial Reconstruction\u201d \u2014 titles that indicate his point of view.Although he generally addresses an academic audience comfortable with terms like \u201cdiscursive process,\u201d \u201cgender exclusions,\u201d \u201cthe vectors of politics,\u201d \u201ccircuits of finance capital,\u201d \u201cimperial arms\u201d and the \u201ccultural arms of the colonizers,\u201d Hahn seems to be targeting a nonspecialist readership as well. He frequently uses phrases like \u201csent packing,\u201d \u201cswallowed the bitter pill,\u201d \u201cposter boy,\u201d \u201cthrew in the towel\u201d and \u201clower the boom.\u201d There\u2019s quite a bit of unraveling too: \u201cSlavery unraveled,\u201d the \u201ccrop economy had unraveled\u201d and then, with the Haymarket bombing in 1886, the American labor movement for a time \u201cunraveled.\u201dIn these later chapters, Hahn\u2019s beguiling border metaphor all but disappears until he reminds us that by the first decade of the 20th century, \u201cthe borders of American nationhood were well secured while the borders of American power remained limitless.\u201d Despite this elegant formulation, so well documented in the preceding pages, there is a slippery, self-annulling quality to it. Borders imply restrictions, and restrictions are very difficult for certain groups, like women, to overcome; but slaves and free people of color can, according to Hahn, sometimes cross \u201cthe apparent borders of enslavement\u201d to win public support. One would have thought the borders of enslavement pretty stiff, especially since the arguments for and against their extension had been so violent and unending. At the same time, Hahn notes, \u201cno borders to slavery could be erected,\u201d particularly after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision, which declared Scott a slave even though he had resided in a free state and territory. So borders can be boundaries, boundaries can be transgressed, or not; borders confine people, but the absence of borders is not freedom.Borders or no, America in the 19th and early 20th centuries comes across as relentlessly imperialist, which to Hahn means a nation formed in acquisition and conquest, large and without mercy \u2014 and whose mission, fortunately for all of us, often fails.Brenda Wineapple is the author, most recently, of \u201cEcstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise.\u201d She is writing a book about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Cabinet Picks Signal Embrace of Wall St. Elite", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe New York Stock Exchange, the hedge fund billionaire George Soros and the chief executive of the investment bank Goldman Sachs flashed across the screen.Now Mr. Trump has named a former Goldman executive and co-investor with Mr. Soros to spearhead his economic policy.With Wednesday\u2019s nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman trader turned hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier, to be Treasury secretary, a new economic leadership is taking shape in Washington.That two investors \u2014 Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross \u2014 will occupy two major economic positions in the new administration is the most powerful signal yet that Mr. Trump plans to emphasize policies friendly to Wall Street, like tax cuts and a relaxation of regulation, in the early days of his administration.While that approach has been cheered by investors (the stocks of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been on a tear since the election), it stands in stark contrast to the populist campaign that Mr. Trump ran and the support he received from working-class voters across the country.Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund executive and member of the Trump transition team, insisted on Wednesday that appointing wealthy investors did not contradict the campaign\u2019s populist message.\u201cThe working-class people of the United States, they need a break,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cAnd we need to switch them from going from the working class into the working poor into what I call the aspirational working class, which my dad was a member of.\u201dStill, Democrats were quick to attack the latest nomination.\u201cSteve Mnuchin is just another Wall Street insider,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a joint statement. \u201cThat is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington \u2014 that is hypocrisy at its worst.\u201dSo far, none of the nominees who will be shaping economic policy have any significant experience in government.Mr. Mnuchin, 53, and Mr. Ross, 79, are both familiar with buying distressed properties and selling for a profit. But they are political neophytes with scant experience in managing large organizations. They will oversee two government agencies that together employ about 130,000 people around the world.In the case of Mr. Mnuchin at Treasury, his experience as a principal investor who made large sums of money through high-risk, high-return wagers suggests that he will look critically at the thicket of regulations that now constrain the risk-taking activities of investment banks.That could mean a reassessment of what has come to be known as the Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that followed the 2008 financial crisis. The rule forbids banks to make certain speculative investments with their own capital.\u201cI would say the No. 1 problem with the Volcker Rule is it\u2019s too complicated and people don\u2019t know how to interpret it,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to look at what to do with it as we are with all of Dodd-Frank. The No. 1 priority is going to be to make sure that banks lend.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Mnuchin also said he would look to cutting corporate tax rates as a way to increase economic growth. And he said the wealthy would not see a big tax cut.There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachs luminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E. Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican, in 2006.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father, Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm.While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broader financial community it is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s track record at hedge and private equity funds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, that makes him appealing.\u201cMnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers \u2014 Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak their language,\u201d said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. \u201cHe comes from a trading desk, and that\u2019s something that is very strong,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, added.While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of Wall Street, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years of experience managing people and organizations under their belt.Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing of IndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in 2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions.After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted by protesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a small-business lender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain.In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted the deal. \u201cHe purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital,\u201d he said of Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan, were sued over their mother\u2019s early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, an investor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. The lawsuit, filed by a trustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3.2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from his mother\u2019s account shortly after she died belonged to other victims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit.Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin.In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company Dune Entertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox. It was a successful partnership; Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune\u2019s money) like \u201cAvatar,\u201d which took in $2.8 billion worldwide in 2009.Some have been major hits, like \u201cGravity,\u201d which took in $723.2 million. But there have also been money losers, including \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea.\u201dStill, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attending celebrity-filled parties at the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the Cannes Film Festival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50 jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo \u2014 playing a Merrill Lynch executive \u2014 in Warren Beatty\u2019s new movie \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201dBeyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners are decidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is Louise Linton, a 34-year-old actress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan real estate: Trump Tower for the president-elect and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin.But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin is described by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command a room. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professional acquaintances than close friends.The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates for Treasury, according to a fund manager close to the president-elect\u2019s economic brain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor who has been close to Mr. Trump for decades.Brooks Barnes and Neil Irwin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dark (and Often Dubious) Art of Forecasting Food Trends", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byRemember when wraps seemed revolutionary? Maybe you had one on your way home from an Alanis Morissette concert in 1996.Then you shifted into a comforting pot roast period, followed by the martini and cupcake years. In the mid-2000s, perhaps you pivoted into a complete rejection of carbs, then slid into the bacon era. Who could forget 2010, when you stood in line at a food truck playing Angry Birds on your new iPad? That line would give way to the Cronut line, the ramen line, the poke line and now the line starting over there by the empanada stand.Of course, the wide and bumpy field of food-trend prognostication has its share of players who build forecasts on research both qualitative and quantitative, and to whom sociology matters more than popularity. Still, the practice is more art than science, often based on not much more than noting what is already percolating in big cities.Before we get too deep into how the nation\u2019s top food-trend oracles practice their dark arts, you probably want to know what\u2019s hot for 2017.Jackfruit! Sorghum! Harissa! And don\u2019t ignore horseradish, spirulina and Asian-inspired breakfasts. Authenticity and its cousin transparency are in. So is food inspired by Africa. Or maybe it\u2019s the Philippines. Even French food has a constituency.Practitioners with a sociological bent are more interested in underlying shifts in culture that play out over time, like changes in the economy or immigration patterns.\u201cTrue food trends move at kind of a glacial pace,\u201d said Annika Stensson, director of research communications for the National Restaurant Association. \u201cIt can take a decade or more to reach the mainstream.\u201dThis year\u2019s list, which includes novel cuts of meat like the Vegas strip steak, healthful children\u2019s meals and street food, may seem dated. But that\u2019s the idea. A fleeting fad is too frivolous to build a business on.A perfect on-trend restaurant for 2017, Ms. Stensson said, would be a fast-casual spot serving dishes with deep, heady African flavors. The dishes should be made with locally produced ingredients, which chefs and skilled home cooks have been using for decades because they often taste better, offer more variety and can be healthier for the environment.Today, many feel imprisoned by the locavore mandate. But for those who don\u2019t follow food fashion, it\u2019s coming on strong. \u201cThe primary reason is, people want to support neighbors in their own community,\u201d Ms. Stensson said.Ms. Cowin, late of Food & Wine, raised an eyebrow at many of this year\u2019s breathless predictions. Vegetable butchery? \u201cThat was so five years ago,\u201d she said.\u201cA good trend is like an Impressionist painting,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s something that looks like one thing, and then you dive in and see it\u2019s really a collection of many little points of paint.\u201dTake fermentation, the darling of the 2016 forecasts. It\u2019s not a trend unto itself, she said, but rather the culmination of several changes that began with the rising popularity of Korean food in America and a particular interest in kimchi. The farm-to-table movement, which steered cooks to pickling as a way to preserve the bounty of harvest, contributed.Interest in fermentation got another boost from research showing the importance of gut health, which also drove interest in probiotics, which led in part to kombucha\u2019s rise. Mix in the nascent D.I.Y. ethos and a flash of excitement about the preserving methods of Nordic cuisine, and you have the fermentation trend.It doesn\u2019t hurt that food in bowls can be visually attractive, perfect for an Instagram feed. At Pinterest, which is used by 150 million people a month, Buddha bowls filled with simple vegan or vegetarian ingredients are among the top items that users post. The name evokes the mindfulness with which a monk holds a bowl of food.\u201cThe overarching trend we are seeing is along vegan, gluten-free and clean eating,\u201d said Stephanie Kumar, head of what Pinterest calls \u201ccategory insights.\u201d\u201cNow, with the way everyone uses social media, we\u2019re seeing it turn around in a matter of two to three months,\u201d Mr. Lempert said.Mr. Lempert is also excited about cellular agriculture, in which companies engineer tissue to create meat and dairy products without an actual animal. It\u2019s a natural extension of the new wave of animal-free proteins that mimic milk or beef, like vegetarian hamburgers that appear to bleed.Mr. Vetter is proud that he predicted chipotle and wasabi as breakout flavors in the early 2000s. His biggest miss was chai, a flavor he thought would cross over from beverages into desserts and other dishes.His new report calls 2017 the year of the egg yolk.

{"Headline": "Italy Just Handed the Global Economy Another Giant Variable", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byGlobal markets were not lacking in precarious unknowns. Italy just added another.As voters on Sunday emphatically rejected constitutional changes aimed at streamlining government and making it easier to revive a moribund economy, they enhanced concerns that Italy\u2019s banks could spiral into a disaster. They reinvigorated worries about the endurance of the euro currency and broader European economic integration. And they amplified the sense that Europe is a land of disappointing growth, political dysfunction and seething populism.\u201cExistential crisis\u201d had not been on the ballot, but that was essentially the result. The lopsided tally against the reforms \u2014 nearly 60 percent rejected them \u2014 prompted the resignation of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, leaving Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy without clear leadership.Investors initially pushed down the euro before it recovered. They cut the price of Italian government bonds, lifting the yield \u2014 a sign that investors will demand greater reward for the heightened risks of lending to Italy. Investors also unloaded Spanish and Portuguese government bonds.The widening spread between lower-yielding German bonds and those issued by debt-saturated European countries amounts to a flashing indicator that investors see risks for the southern periphery. These market moves were muted because the results had been anticipated.Indeed, for Europe and the rest of the world, this dynamic was uncomfortably familiar. For nearly a decade, the 19 nations sharing the euro have lurched from one crisis to the next, with no effective fix. A currency designed to unite the adversaries of World War II has instead generated fresh divisions \u2014 between creditor and borrower; Northern Europe and the Mediterranean.In a year in which Britain voted to abandon the European Union and the American electorate selected Donald J. Trump as the next president, Italy offered its own contribution to the global populist insurrection. Against this backdrop, the basic contours of the world economy are now uncertain.Even that possibility threatens Europe with trouble. If investors worry that Italy may leave the euro, they will demand greater rewards for continued lending. Those with the greatest debt burdens \u2014 Greece, Spain and Portugal \u2014 could see their borrowing costs rise beyond their ability to pay.For now, such grim scenarios appear remote. The referendum maintains the power of the Italian legislature\u2019s upper chamber, a potent check on the Five Star Movement, or any government pursuing radical change.The most immediate consequences fall on the Italian banking system, now choked with some 360 billion euro, or about $385 billion, in suspect debts.Mr. Renzi tried and failed to inject public funds into Monte dei Paschi, the perpetual locus of fears about an Italian-bred financial conflagration. The European Union, led by Germany, effectively forbade that step, citing new rules barring taxpayer bailouts to limit the temptation of bankers to engage in reckless lending.Mr. Renzi instead forged a plan that has Monte dei Paschi scrambling to secure \u20ac5 billion from private investors.\u201cFor Monte dei Paschi, it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to close the capital raise by end of the year,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cThe political future is so uncertain.\u201dMost experts assume a caretaker Italian government will wind up seeking permission from European authorities for some form of a taxpayer-financed rescue of Monte dei Paschi, while agreeing to wipe out the investments of a thin slice of bondholders.The consensus is that Italy can patch immediate holes in the banking system. But the referendum has destroyed what momentum existed to address the condition that is both cause and effect of the banking problem \u2014 a dire lack of economic growth.Mr. Renzi pursued reforms aimed at spurring companies to invest. He made it easier for companies to terminate low-performing workers to eliminate a chief impediment to hiring them in the first place \u2014 the fear that giving someone a job was akin to adopting them as a dependent forever.He sought to speed civil processes in the notoriously inefficient court system to make it easier for banks to recoup bad debts by collecting collateral.The constitutional changes he sought were aimed at clearing another blockage to reform. They would have trimmed the powers of the upper chamber of the legislature, a place where proposals die.Voters clearly did not trust Mr. Renzi to wield greater power. Now, they will be represented by someone with less power where it matters a great deal: Brussels and Berlin.Debt-saturated nations in Europe have long argued that their burdens would be lighter if they could spend more money to spur faster economic growth.But the European Union \u2014 anchored by Germany \u2014 has cited rules limiting the spending of member governments with big debts. Instead, Brussels and Berlin argue, such countries must deliver so-called structural reforms, stripping away labor protections and trimming pension benefits.In a testament to the severity of this creed, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble effectively threatened to banish Greece from the euro if Athens did not deliver on reforms it promised as a condition of successive European bailouts.Mr. Renzi was a rare leader who carried credibility in such quarters. He gained modest relief from European spending strictures in part by pointing at his reforms.\u201cRenzi is the only leader in recent history who has advanced a structural reform agenda,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.Now, Mr. Renzi is gone, along with his reform trajectory. What is most palpably still here is an Italian economy that is growing anemically, soon to be presided over by a caretaker government with a limited mandate.\u201cWhat chance does a less effective prime minister overseeing a caretaker government have of getting a hearing in Brussels and Berlin?\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible.\u201dItaly has no fuel for growth. It has no clear way to extricate itself \u2014 or the other parts of the planet connected to money \u2014 from the perils of its grinding banking crisis. And the one reinforces the other.Advertisement"}

A headline in the daily La Repubblica declaring, \u201cThe No Triumphs, Renzi Quits,\u201d echoing the sentiment in most newspapers.Commentators acknowledged Mr. Renzi\u2019s dignified reaction to what mostly seemed a vote against his tenure, and they called for responsibility from political forces.\u201cNow the reality is the risk of a return to the swamps and to instability,\u201d Mario Calabresi, editor in chief of La Repubblica, wrote in a front-page editorial on Monday. \u201cA scenario that Italy really doesn\u2019t need.\u201dOnce Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation is official and he steps down, Mr. Mattarella would then hold talks with the political parties trying to form a caretaker government or call early elections.According to the Italian news media, one candidate who could lead a temporary government is Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a technocrat. The speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso, a longtime anti-mafia magistrate, is also a possibility.Although most opposition parties are pushing for quick elections, opponents of Mr. Renzi in his Democratic Party are more inclined to take their time. \u2014 GAIA PIANIGIANIBeppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement who campaigned against the proposed constitutional changes and against Mr. Renzi, declared on Monday that \u201ctimes have changed.\u201dHow much so may depend on Mr. Grillo\u2019s ability to parlay his latest success into a full sweep of the political establishment he has thumbed his nose at for years.Mr. Grillo, a former comedian, said that Italians should waste no time pressing for a new electoral law and for the dismantling of the old order.The Five Star Movement won a quarter of the vote in 2013 national elections. Mr. Grillo said then that cooperating with traditional parties in any sort of alliance would be akin to capitulation.A breakdown of returns shows that opposition to the constitutional changes was widespread, though more pronounced in the south.Only three regions backed the changes: the historically leftist areas of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna in central Italy, and Trentino-Alto Adige in the far north.In the economically struggling Sicily and Sardinia, which voted against the changes, the divide between the camps was as large as 44 percentage points. The pattern was similar in areas with high unemployment and social problems.\u201cThe country isn\u2019t growing, and voters blamed their personal condition on the government,\u201d said Stefano Folli, a commentator for La Repubblica.The results also reflected a generational divide. According to a survey reported by the news channel Sky TG24, young voters rejected the proposed changes, while more than half of those over 55 supported them. \u2014 GAIA PIANIGIANIIn analyzing the results, Italian pundits did not always agree, except on one point: the severe consequences for Mr. Renzi.\u201cDoes Renzi represent the country from a political, cultural point of view? Yesterday\u2019s vote is a clear rejection of Renzi\u2019s economic policies and of how he envisioned the country,\u201d the political commentator Mario Sechi said. Mr. Renzi \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him,\u201d he added.For Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the \u201cno\u201d campaign brought together divergent political forces.Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renzi\u2019s \u201creformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium,\u201d he said.The nearly 60 percent of the population that voted against him is \u201chighly divided, with nothing in common, and no leader,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. What joins them is a conservative, anti-European outlook. \u201cWithin that, you have the most extreme left and right.\u201dThe person to watch in the short term is Mr. Mattarella, the president. \u201cThis is the first real test of the president of the Republic, who has kept mostly in the background,\u201d said Antonio Polito, deputy director of the Milan-based daily Corriere della Sera. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDOThe euro first fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading after the vote, but recovered by the morning in Europe, and it even gained ground compared with last week. Major European stock markets were all slightly higher. \u2014 JACK EWINGThe vote results and Mr. Renzi\u2019s decision to step down drew a jubilant response from other populist leaders in Europe.How leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.The image of Italy as a nation that \u201cbobs more or less happily in stagnant water between the third largest public debt in the world and a banking system in a deep coma\u201d must be \u201cvigorously contested,\u201d he wrote.\u201cJust as a \u2018Yes\u2019 victory wouldn\u2019t have been a passport to paradise, the \u2018No\u2019 vote is not a condemnation to hell. In any case, hard and serious work is needed to face a massive challenge, of finding real growth and modernizing a system that\u2019s been weakened by a violent crisis and by innumerable problems that have been dragging on for decades.\u201dVincenzo Boccia, the president of Italy\u2019s main business lobby, Confindustria, said the referendum results highlighted the need to tackle pressing economic issues like \u201cdebt, deficit and still-insufficient growth.\u201d\u201cGrowth is the only way to eliminate inequalities and poverty,\u201d he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Italian companies have been making \u201ccrucial efforts\u201d to compete in international markets, he added, and need the government to back them up. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDOThe populist victory in Italy was hailed by many like-minded leaders across Eastern Europe, where similar sentiments are on the rise, but their reaction was tempered by widespread concern that the results would accelerate the fraying of the European Union, upon which the region has come to depend.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Poland, the largest economy in the region, seemed torn between praising a victory by populists who share its governing party views and worrying about vulnerability to Russia.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Tomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic strategist in Prague for the lender CSOB, tied the Italian defeat directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and predicted a dire future. \u201cDemocracy, and the future of the euro in Europe, is truly walking on the edge of a knife,\u201d he said.In Slovakia, where anti-euro sentiment is widespread, many residents say that embracing the currency led to higher prices for everyday goods. \u201cWe can expect a referendum about leaving the eurozone,\u201d predicted Richard Zulik, leader of Slovakia\u2019s liberal Freedom and Solidarity party. \u2014 RICK LYMANFinance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro expressed relief that the economic reaction to the Italian referendum was muted. Yet the vote could still roil the European Union: It threatens to embolden opponents of the single currency, which could destabilize the Italian economy and foment turmoil in the banking sector.Helping to stoke that concern is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s oldest lender, which faces questions about whether it has sufficient capital.Asked whether a planned capital increase for the bank would now be delayed, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the so-called Eurogroup of finance ministers, emphasized that Italy first needed to select a new leader.Even as Brussels scrambled to stave off negative financial consequences, ministers from fiscally hawkish countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not want to be seen by their own electorates as being overly permissive toward Italy.\u2014 JAMES KANTERAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump may not himself be a racist, and Trump voters may not believe they themselves are bigoted, but Mr. Trump used lies, racism, misogyny, xenophobia and Islamophobia to sway voters.Every Trump voter claims to have voted for the right reasons. To those people I say, if you voted for the man who claimed that Mexican immigrants were rapists and murderers, then you are complicit when a Latino child is threatened with deportation by schoolmates.If you voted for a man who appealed to white supremacists, who used language right out of the \u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion,\u201d then you are complicit when a racial epithet is scrawled on a schoolroom door or when a swastika is painted on a synagogue wall.If you voted for the man who demonized Muslims, then you are complicit when a mosque is burned down.You are responsible for and complicit in everything this narcissistic, self-serving, authoritarian, willfully ignorant demagogue does.Yes, your motives in voting for Mr. Trump may have been beyond reproach, but, nevertheless, you are complicit. Now, you have to live with your complicity.JOYCE DENNWoodbury, Minn.To the Editor:The lone gunman theory of the 2016 election \u2014 racism won it \u2014 ignores the evidence of 209 counties that went for Donald Trump after going twice for Barack Obama. Unless those voters never noticed that Mr. Obama is black, they based their decisions on something other than race.If they feel stereotyped as bigots when the next election nears, Democrats will have a tough time winning them back.MICHAEL SMITHCynthiana, Ky.To the Editor:I cannot speak for the entire country. But in Florida, David Paul Kuhn\u2019s analysis of why working-class whites voted for Donald Trump is dead wrong. I was an election worker in Hillsborough County (Tampa) and I can tell you that the Trump voters there were racially motivated.My fellow poll workers and I saw it \u2014 and heard it \u2014 throughout the seven days of Florida\u2019s early voting. We witnessed attempted intimidation by whites at polls in black neighborhoods. We heard threats and racial insults.Florida is not Ohio. It is not pining for lost blue-collar jobs. Florida\u2019s economy rebounded very well after the recession. Black folks voted overwhelmingly for the candidate they felt would protect them and their interests. White people voted based on their race.It really was as simple as that. I suspect that many people in the North prefer the comforting story of economic grievance, or Democratic \u201celites\u201d out of touch with the masses. But, at least in Florida, the truth was obvious.GENE WRIGHTSanta Rosa, Calif.To the Editor:Since the elections, The Times and every other media outlet have showered the public with explanations of why Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, including David Paul Kuhn\u2019s Op-Ed essay.These explanations all miss the point. When we lose a basketball game 97-96, there is no single cause, other than the fact that the other side scored more points than we did. Did we lose because of the easy shot I missed in the first quarter? Or because our star player was injured? Or because of that blown call by the referee? Yes, yes and yes.And thus it was with the election. Mrs. Clinton would have won if she had been a better candidate, or if voters had been more appalled by Mr. Trump\u2019s racist rants, or if there were no Electoral College or if more city dwellers had voted in the Rust Belt. Or if any of a hundred other things had happened. WILLIAM COLENew YorkTo the Editor:Bigotry and racism are part of the fabric of most societies worldwide. In civilized countries they largely stay below the surface, because the prevailing moral view discourages such sentiments, and this moral imperative is voiced by society\u2019s political, academic and religious leaders.What we have seen in our country is that mainstream leaders have not shied away from espousing outrageous positions. Donald Trump has done this extremely well, just as earlier demagogues have done. He has instilled a feeling of fear, which morphed into a feeling of hate and rage.This allowed many to feel comfortable about expressing their bigotry and voting for Mr. Trump. This bigotry was tolerated by too many of our leaders.PAUL MATHIEUSun City Center, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Italy, a Sleeper Crisis for the E.U.", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe senators have blocked many decisions made by the Parliament in the past; because they tend to be older (minimum age of 40), they are often seen as a symbol of Italy\u2019s \u201cgerontocrazia.\u201d Reducing the powers of the Senate is a key step to modernizing Italy\u2019s political system and meeting economic challenges. In fact, a majority of the senators agreed with Mr. Renzi\u2019s reforms, and they seemed likely to be approved in the plebiscite.But in polls after September (before a blackout was imposed leading up to the vote), public opinion turned against Mr. Renzi and his proposals. That is largely because he has failed to deliver on his main promise to improve the economy. Italy has not yet fully recovered from the 2008 global crisis: For example, unemployment is higher than in most of the European Union, with youth unemployment hovering around 40 percent.By these economic indicators, \u201cla crisi,\u201d as the Italians call it, is as deep as the depression that hit Poland and other Eastern European countries after 1989. Southern Italy now even has a lower gross domestic product per capita than Poland, adjusted for purchasing power.Mr. Renzi made efforts to change things. He introduced job-market reforms that made it easier to hire young workers and eased some of the protections enjoyed by employees with older contracts. He has raised the retirement age modestly, a necessary step because of rising life expectancy (Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the Western world) and to relieve the welfare state.Mr. Renzi has also hired many young ministers instead of the old power brokers like Massimo D\u2019Alema, the former leader of Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party who now recommends a no vote. All in all, Mr. Renzi\u2019s policies are reminiscent of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour in the 1990s or Germany\u2019s labor-market and pension reforms under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der after the turn of the millennium.Mr. Renzi, however, is operating in a much worse global economic context. Italy cannot build on an export-driven growth model like Germany under Mr. Schr\u00f6der, and it is suffering under a heavy debt burden left by Silvio Berlusconi.And the tide has turned against reformist social democracy in Italy and elsewhere. The populists on the left and right build on the disenchantment, ire and despair of large parts of the electorate. They promise a real rupture, which Mr. Renzi\u2019s party, part of the political establishment, cannot credibly offer.If he loses the plebiscite and steps down, as he has vowed to do, the European Union would be badly damaged as well. Mr. Renzi is staunchly pro-European, while the populists rally against Brussels and the austerity policies of the Union. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, understood this and unveiled a 315 billion euro investment plan in 2015. But it is probably too little, too late to help Mr. Renzi, even as Italy could benefit from investments in solar power and urgently needs investment in internet communication.Mr. Renzi\u2019s foes \u2014 the left-wing populists of the Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, and the right-wing populists of the Northern League \u2014 fiercely attack the prime minister and the European Union. Mr. Grillo has indicated that if the plebiscite fails, he wants to hold a referendum on dropping the euro.Brexit has set an example that a nation can vote against the advice offered by economic and political experts. Even without a plebiscite about the euro, Italy might become almost impossible to govern.That will certainly frighten the financial markets. If the interest rates for Italy\u2019s public debt, which at the moment stands at about 132 percent of gross domestic product, continue to rise (speculation against Italian government bonds has already started in recent weeks), it might be difficult to keep Italy in the eurozone.If Italy, the fourth-largest economy of the European Union, rejects the euro, the common currency would be finished, and probably the Union as well. But how would the populists, once in power, act? If they have the choice between state bankruptcy and keeping the euro, they might still opt for the common currency.The founding members of the European Economic Community reacted to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakdown of state socialism by establishing the more deeply integrated European Union and the euro. That worked well until the crisis of 2008.It might be, however, that the union and the common currency were made for good times, not for bad ones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Lies Ahead for Luxury in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayIn 2017 the luxury industry will be faced with a precarious balancing act on multiple fronts. Brands will be forced to find an equilibrium between an exponential growth in technology and their traditional emphasis on the human hand; between understanding their customers\u2019 behavior and surveilling it; between their global presence and their local consumer groups; and between the poles of a customer spectrum that stretches not just around the world, but over decades, from Generation Z to the silver dollar.If they do not, they risk failure \u2014 not because of the macro environment of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, though that cannot be ignored, but because of their own inability to change with an ever more rapidly changing world.Risk is no longer defined as \u201cdoing something new,\u201d but rather \u201cdoing what was done before,\u201d while the greatest opportunity lies in accessing, and embracing, \u201cthe soulful economy.\u201dIt was a constant theme, stretching from the potentially positive effects on manufacturing and the supply chain to the issues of cybersecurity and big data collection, via the complicated question of social media and communications. It\u2019s not just about Facebook anymore, especially when it comes to new and younger consumers who \u201crule the internet\u201d but whose attention span is subject to \u201cconstant churn,\u201d in the words of Ms. Valiando Rojas, and who have a deep-seated antipathy to traditional marketing.Meanwhile, the data collection that has been so lauded in the luxury world, which has been focused on the need to connect intelligence across the retail chain to better serve a constantly traveling customer, contains within it an often unacknowledged threat that could prompt a backlash if not carefully monitored: People want to be recognized, but not known \u2014 which may sound like a specious distinction, but it needs to be parsed on micro level.How to add \u201csoul\u201d to the virtual world \u2014 and what exactly that means (character, ethics, entertainment and experience; not avatars) \u2014 is a conundrum for all luxury brands.It puts new emphasis on identifying and responding to local tastes (to hew only to a single message may seem irrelevant in a walled-up world), and essentially iterating the overall message in a variety of tailor-made ways. Though social media may be connecting the message across borders, it also encourages a multiplicity of voices that should not be ignored. And it acknowledges the need to create internal communities to retain talent.It is this paradox \u2014 that technology, while \u201cimproving connectivity and reducing complexity\u201d as Mr. Kurzweil said, also casts an evermore seductive light on what it lacks: the human element \u2014 and how it is resolved that will define the future of an industry based on the work of the hand. \u201cCorporate\u201d and \u201ccreative\u201d are no longer enough.

{"Headline": "The Housing Crisis Lives On for Minorities", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe mortgage crisis that ravaged the economy eight years ago was especially damaging to African-American communities, where homeowners who qualified for affordable mortgages were often steered into high-priced loans that paid rich returns to mortgage brokers and lenders while leaving borrowers vulnerable to default.The ensuing glut of vacant homes drove down property values almost everywhere. But minority communities suffered disproportionately, widening the already considerable wealth gap between white and minority households.Foreclosed homes in minority areas had many more problems, as defined by the checklist, than homes in white areas. About a third of the foreclosed properties in minority areas had more than 10 problems, while only 7 percent of the foreclosed properties in white areas had that many. The suit argues that race was the driving factor in these differences, not crime levels, property values or other nonracial factors. For that reason, the plaintiffs contend, Fannie Mae was in violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968.Fannie Mae disputes the allegations and says that its maintenance standards are designed to ensure that all of its properties are treated equally. This might be true. But the copious evidence in this lawsuit suggests that those standards are being applied unequally.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denver\u2019s Gritty Back Door Could Become Its New Gateway", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetAmong the unconventional work spaces and restaurants in the district, known as RiNo and north of downtown, is Comal, a lunch spot with Latin American cuisine where women from low-income backgrounds are learning how to run a business. In RiNo\u2019s recently opened Denver Central Market, shoppers can grab a sandwich, coffee or fresh fish,or sit at a bar and take in the scene.The neighborhood has attracted artists who helped gentrify the old and neglected industrial expanse, which in its dilapidated condition was long considered the back door into downtown from westbound I-70.Mr. Campbell, a former Wall Street bond trader who moved to Denver in 2010, is hardly the first investor to descend on RiNo in recent years, though the development\u2019s successful completion would rank as one of the most ambitious projects to date. He considers it the right place for a global commerce center, citing as draws the city\u2019s growing corporate roster, affordability and active outdoor culture.\u201cWhether you\u2019re in New York or the San Francisco Bay Area, Denver is going to be 60 cents on the dollar for the foreseeable future compared to those markets,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing large companies saying, \u2018Places like Silicon Valley are nice, but we can use Denver and its Rocky Mountain backdrop as a lifestyle tool for recruitment and retention.\u2019\u201dThe first phase of the World Trade Center Denver project will include 250,000 square feet of offices and creative working space, a 200-room hotel, conference space, and shops and restaurants. It will be adjacent to a recently opened stop on a light rail line that connects Denver International Airport to Union Station downtown, about two miles away.Mr. Campbell is seeking tenants and financing, and he anticipates preleasing about 60 percent of the office space before beginning construction late next year.The World Trade Center Denver team and city officials supporting the project say it is the right time to promote the city internationally. They cite average year-over-year employment growth of 3.5 percent in the metro area from 2013 to 2015, and growth of more than 3 percent through October this year.Denver\u2019s diversified economy relies less on the boom-and-bust industries of energy and real estate than it did a few decades ago, they contend, and to a large degree, they credit the city\u2019s airport. When it opened in 1995, officials did not anticipate the high number of visitors, business travelers included, who would make Denver a destination rather than a stopover, said Tom Clark, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.Since then, the city has worked to increase nonstop flights to international destinations, he said. Today those include Munich, Tokyo and London, and the airport is pursuing flights into Dubai, Paris, Beijing and other markets.\u201cI\u2019ve lived through oil and gas ups and downs and the dot-com bust, but in none of those times did we have such a diverse economy,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cThe transformative nature of the airport has turned us into a much different economic region.\u201dJust how different can be seen in RiNo, where private investors and the city are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build it up and create a new gateway into Denver. Start-ups, and technology and creative companies have been migrating to the district for about the last five years, attracted to the area\u2019s cachet, as well as new buildings and converted warehouses that are now offices, food halls, brewpubs and entertainment venues.Larger established firms have also moved to the neighborhood or are planning to, including Uber, HomeAdvisor, a University of Colorado medical campus office and Boa Technology, a firm focused on closing systems for footwear like snowboarding boots.Other developers have added similar collaborative office environments in RiNo, and some three million square feet of office space is planned for the area, said Mr. Harrington, who is marketing a large mixed-use campus proposed by the local developer Westfield Company on 14 acres in the district. He estimated that as more office projects in RiNo are completed over the next several quarters, tenants would most likely pay $3 to $5 less per square foot than they would in the downtown and Lower Downtown submarkets, a discount of roughly 10 to 15 percent.One future disagreement is likely to be housing, Kyle Zeppelin predicted. Lenders have cooled to Denver apartment development, and he says he believes that market conditions are encouraging high-end condominium projects instead.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what RiNo needs or wants,\u201d said Mr. Zeppelin, who with his father is also developing a boutique hotel in RiNo next to the Source, a red brick foundry that they converted into an artisan food market.\u201cBut there\u2019s a disconnect between the urban fabric and culture of the neighborhood and what speculators want to do,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat to the future potential of RiNo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the approximate average cost for land in the River North Art District of Denver. It is $150 per square foot, not per acre.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Fund Seeks Both Financial and Social Returns", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cThere is a lazy mindedness that we afford the do-gooders.\u201dThat was Bono, the musician turned activist turned investor, lamenting the pitfalls of what has become an increasingly fashionable form of financing: social impact investing.Just about every big Wall Street firm and big-time philanthropist has recently tried to get in on what\u2019s often called double bottom line investing. The idea is that an investment isn\u2019t just intended to score a high return; perhaps more important, it is supposed to make a significant difference in an area that had been considered un-investable. Goldman Sachs, for example, created social impact bonds to reduce the recidivism rate for adolescent offenders at the Rikers Island correctional facility in New York City.Most of these efforts have had mixed results; either investors lost money, or the social impact was negligible or nonexistent.It has become, as Bono told me, \u201ca lot of bad deals done by good people.\u201dMr. McGlashan has long overseen TPG Growth, a fund he started that was an early investor in the sharing economy, with stakes in Uber and Airbnb, as well other technology successes like Spotify. His first fund had an annualized rate of return \u2014 the metric that private equity firms use to measure themselves \u2014 of 20 percent; the second fund\u2019s return was 45 percent.Others have tried to build social impact funds at a much smaller scale. Rise does away with benchmarks manufactured after the fact and has created a series of strict metrics by which to measure social impact. And an outside auditor has been brought in to keep it honest.And the investors involved don\u2019t consider this charity \u2014 pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are expected to be among the biggest investors. At least two large pension funds and one sovereign wealth fund have committed nine figure sums, according to people briefed on the investments, which have yet to be made public.\u201cThe reality is that no matter which side of the aisle you\u2019re on, and no matter where your framework is, if I can build a great business that\u2019s profitable and successful and, oh, by the way, here\u2019s the impact and the multiple of impact that\u2019s created through that business\u2019s successes, I think that\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d Mr. McGlashan told me.The new fund is expected to invest about half of its money domestically in areas like health care, education and clean energy technologies. The other half will be invested in emerging markets in sectors like microlending and other financial services, housing and education.\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of charity here,\u201d Mr. McGlashan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make money and build profitable successful businesses and create a top performing fund. But in the process, what we\u2019ve committed to is that we will not do a deal where there\u2019s less than a two and a half times multiple of impact,\u201d suggesting a meaningful social impact that can be measured.The problem with most of these kinds of funds is what Mr. McGlashan calls \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d a euphemism for lying, which some in philanthropy feel is rampant among socially conscious investors. Everyone wants to claim some form of success using a shifting mix of metrics aimed at demonstrating how the fund worked.\u201cNone of this makes sense unless you can actually define what \u2018impact\u2019 means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be religion; it has to be quantitative. It has to be something that a third-party view would validate.\u201dBono put it this way: \u201cI asked them to hang a sign in their office saying, \u2018Warm Fuzzy Feelings Not Welcome Here,\u2019 because we need them to be tough-minded. We need some intellectual rigor, and you\u2019ve got to get these metrics right.\u201dMr. McGlashan, often in concert with Mr. Skoll, spent the past year working with Bridgespan Group, a consulting firm that has long worked for philanthropists \u2014 including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 to come up with a rigorous set of metrics with which to measure performance.If it works, Mr. McGlashan hopes to one day change the fee structure of funds like this so the investors are paid based on social impact, not necessarily just on financial performance. For the first Rise fund, Mr. McGlashan\u2019s group, which will include most of TPG Growth\u2019s professional staff, will be paid on financial performance, which is likely to make his job harder, not easier. He needs to find good investments, but his board and investors will also be focusing on whether the fund also delivers on its social impact promise.Mr. Skoll said he expected to know whether the fund would be successful in relatively short order. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a good idea within two years,\u201d he said.Bridgespan\u2019s metrics for Rise could become a model for other investment firms if they prove successful, especially in a global political climate that is rethinking its capitalistic system.\u201cCapitalism is going up on trial, and I think that it\u2019s clear that putting profit before people is a nonsustainable business model,\u201d Bono said. \u201cI think giving those two equal time is the way forward, and I think that in the present climate, we need to rethink, reimagine what it is. It\u2019s not that capitalism is immoral; it\u2019s amoral. And it\u2019s a better servant than master.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have to be a bit modest about where we are with Rise and be actually a bit tough on ourselves. I\u2019d be more comfortable speaking about this in a year\u2019s time or two year\u2019s time as we go along.\u201dLet\u2019s plan on that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Closing China\u2019s Ivory Market: Will It Save Elephants?", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWill this save the elephants? This is what experts on the plight of elephants say:\u2022 It all depends on the price. If China simply shuts down its legal ivory trade but does little to combat the much bigger illegal trade, then the price of ivory (now about $500 a pound) will stay high, giving poachers an incentive to keep killing.\u2022 Making all ivory illegal in China could actually push the price up, like illegal drugs.\u2022 Neighboring markets will be crucial. If Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and others do not take similar steps, then many Chinese will simply buy their ivory from other places, which will keep demand high.\u2022 Many elephants are also hunted for bush meat. China\u2019s new policy will not affect that.\u2022 If the Chinese government really commits to combating the ivory trade, then the price of ivory could collapse. Criminal organizations and poachers will then abandon the business, and Africa\u2019s elephant herds could recover for the first time in years.Ivory comes from an elephant\u2019s tusks, the equivalent of its incisor teeth. Ivory has been coveted for thousands of years because it is strong, beautiful and relatively easy to carve.In the 19th century, European nations used ivory for billiard balls, piano keys, buttons, snuffboxes and false teeth. Countless elephants in central Africa were shot down. Joseph Conrad thinly fictionalized the ruthless scramble for ivory in \u201cHeart of Darkness.\u201dScientists believe that before the 19th-century ivory craze, more than 10 million elephants roamed the earth. Today, there are about 500,000.Around 2002, conservationists across Africa started noticing the same thing: a growing proportion of dead elephants with their faces sawed off and tusks missing. At the same time, China\u2019s economy was beginning to boom. In China, ivory is a status symbol, carved into bracelets, bookmarks, shot glasses, statuettes, chopsticks, combs and many other objects. As China\u2019s middle class grew to the hundreds of millions, a new scramble for ivory intensified.The ivory trade has been abetted by pervasive corruption, extreme poverty and the presence of armed groups in many areas of Africa where the last great elephant herds roam.Elephants are killed many ways. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have been shot by poachers from helicopters. In Kenya, bows and arrows are often used, a quieter method that attracts less attention. In Malawi, poisoned pumpkins are rolled into the road for the elephants to eat. The poachers include subsistence hunters, rebel groups and even American-allied African militaries.Criminal gangs buy the ivory from poachers and ship it to Asia, bribing government officials along the way. The ivory is sometimes packed with anchovies or chili peppers, to throw off the sniffer dogs used by customs agents and law enforcement officials.Wildlife researchers estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of all smuggled elephant ivory \u2014 maybe even more \u2014 ends up in China, where there are countless ivory workshops and showrooms, many perfectly legal.But many wildlife experts say this system is a farce. The ivory papers can be easily forged, and the ivory in public shops is often smuggled ivory from recently killed elephants that has been illegally imported and fraudulently labeled.Iain Douglas-Hamilton, one of the world\u2019s most renowned elephant researchers, said that up until a few years ago, Chinese officials denied that their country was a part of the ivory problem.\u201cIt was a topic you couldn\u2019t bring up with them,\u201d Mr. Douglas-Hamilton said.But over the years, he said, China has grown embarrassed by the criticism it has received around the world for its appetite for ivory. Wildlife groups, the American government, African governments and international movie stars have harangued China to say no to ivory.\u201cChina has come through an extraordinary evolution,\u201d Mr. Douglas-Hamilton said.China says it will shut down its ivory trade by the end of 2017. It says it will start by closing the legal ivory processing factories.But will this simply drive the trade underground? For instance, it is forbidden in China to traffic in tiger parts.But there is still a thriving underground trade in tiger bones, used to make very expensive wines cherished for their supposed medicinal powers.Some consumers seem to get an additional thrill from knowing tiger-bone wine is highly illegal.Karl Ammann, a documentary filmmaker and independent wildlife investigator in Kenya, said he was worried that something like this could happen to ivory.Ivory\u2019s value as a status symbol could actually increase, he said, if ivory is seen as a statement of being above the law.\u201cIf it\u2019s illegal, that might make it even more attractive,\u201d he said.Mr. Ammann also said that many ivory-carving factories had already moved to Vietnam. On a recent trip to Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, he said, he visited an ivory workshop that used a computerized machine that carved five ivory pieces at once.The reaction among many wildlife experts in Africa can be summed up in one word: cautious.\u201cAssuming they are able to break the market, for us it does offer a bit of light at the end of a very dark tunnel,\u201d said Emmanuel de Merode, the director of Virunga National Park in Congo.But he quickly added: \u201cIvory can be stockpiled. Some people may think it\u2019s worth trying to get more ivory in case the market opens one day.\u201dThat could mean an increase in poaching before China\u2019s ban takes effect.Paula Kahumbu, the chief executive of WildlifeDirect, a conservation group in Kenya, said she was \u201csuspicious\u201d about China\u2019s motives and its commitment to fight the ivory trade.\u201cChina needs Africa right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just buying good will.\u201dMs. Kahumbu cited several Chinese infrastructure projects that had caused problems for Kenya\u2019s wildlife.When it comes to Africa, she said, China does not have \u201can environmental bone\u201d in its body.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Xi Jinping Can Avoid Becoming a Dictator", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSince the 1980s, the Communist Party has followed an unwritten rule to ensure an orderly leadership transition and prevent a Mao-style autocracy. The head of the party serves a 10-year term and, halfway into his tenure, he nominates a successor with the help of party elders. In Mr. Xi\u2019s case, he would need to name an heir at the party convention next year.What makes Mr. Xi believe he could pull off this power grab?First, the Communist Party charter does not impose term limits for its top leader. The 10-year limit is based on an unwritten custom.Mr. Xi has also been reshaping regional and international affairs in the country\u2019s favor. His tough stance on territorial disputes in the South China Sea has gained him wide political support at home.Mr. Xi has no formidable rivals. He has used the anticorruption drive to purge disloyal party and military leaders, and to weaken his fellow Politburo Standing Committee members. Party elders are too old or too weak to cause him trouble.But based on my hundreds of interviews with the Chinese business and political elite, Mr. Xi is not invincible. An attempt to hold on to power by breaking with party tradition on leadership transition would be politically risky and potentially self-destructive. A power grab could set off a strong revolt within the party.Mr. Xi lacks the authority and credentials of a founding father of Communist China. While the Chinese public appears to welcome a strong leader, it may not tolerate a prolonged one-man rule reminiscent of Mao, who ruled from 1949 until his death in 1976.And the public is not as easily manipulated as it used to be. The government is finding it harder to control the content of the internet. Protests against Mr. Xi and his government spread through social media within minutes.Mr. Xi\u2019s credibility with the people is built on how well he delivers economic growth. So far, he is failing. The pace of China\u2019s economic growth continues to slide, and people appear to be losing confidence in his ability to manage the economy.Mr. Xi\u2019s best option for extending power is to overhaul the Communist Party\u2019s system of governance. Over the past year, think tanks and constitutional scholars are said to have conducted secret studies on how to legitimately prolong Mr. Xi\u2019s rule. Some scholars, including Cao Siyuan, have suggested adopting an electoral presidential system tailored for China.It may seem far-fetched, but such a system would grant Mr. Xi the legitimacy and public support he craves to stay in power. Without the legitimacy of an election, even a flawed one by Western standards, he would have to step down in 2022 or flagrantly ignore the party rules, and turn himself into a dictator who lives in constant fear of being toppled.In transitioning to an electoral system, Mr. Xi could change China\u2019s Constitution by the end of his term in 2022 to strengthen the power of the president. Once the president is given control of the government and the military, Mr. Xi could abolish the Politburo Standing Committee, shed his title as general secretary of the party, and run for a newly empowered presidency.The party\u2019s central committee could nominate candidates, and legislators could be given the power to choose the president in a competitive race. (In the current system, legislators select the president but it\u2019s a rubber stamp.) Ideally these changes would pave the way toward direct elections for members of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s top legislature. Given his popularity and leverage within the party, Mr. Xi could gain himself more time as China\u2019s leader.Such a system might resemble Russia\u2019s flawed presidential system \u2014 which may make it appealing to Mr. Xi, who is said to admire President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s grip on power. But any step in the direction of democracy is welcome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Reassures Homeowners Worried About Land Rights", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byChinese officials said that a group of homeowners in Wenzhou, an eastern city, would not have to pay a fee to extend the rights to the land under their residences. Homeowners in China own their dwellings but not the land under them. All land in China is owned by the government, which parcels it out to developers and homeowners through 20- to 70-year leases.In Wenzhou, the local government had told some homeowners whose 20-year leases had expired that they would have to pay a large fee to renew, and the situation was being monitored closely across the country. Many Chinese homeowners, a bedrock of the country\u2019s economy and growing consumer sector, worried that they would have to pay dearly to keep using the land under their homes.The decision, announced on Friday by Wang Guanghua, China\u2019s vice minister of land and resources, stops short of providing homeowners nationwide a clear legal framework on land ownership rights. Nevertheless, it could pave the way for similar moves in other cities.At a news conference, Mr. Wang said that the measures were temporary and that the government was working on \u201crelevant legal arrangements\u201d for those holding 70-year leases, according to a transcript of the briefing on the ministry\u2019s website. Much of China\u2019s residential land is covered by 70-year leases.Land ownership rights became a focus in Wenzhou in April when the local government demanded that homeowners whose land-use rights had expired after 20 years pay fees of up to a third of the value of their homes before they could sell them. The decision provoked protests from property owners in Wenzhou, a coastal city of eight million that was one of the first areas to establish private enterprise after the Chinese government opened the economy in the late 1970s.Xinhua, the main state news agency, hailed the government\u2019s decision as \u201cone small step for Wenzhou, one giant leap for China.\u201d Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, called it \u201cthe biggest news of the year.\u201dLand-use rights are set to expire in Qingdao, Jinan and Shenzhen, Xinhua said.The measures \u201cconform to the expectations of the masses,\u201d it said in a commentary on Saturday. \u201cFor all citizens, it is transmitting spring\u2019s first glow of warm air.\u201dThe number of residents affected by the 20-year land-use rights in Wenzhou is relatively small. China Youth Daily, a state-run news outlet, said about 600 households had 20-year leases expiring next year and 1,700 others had such leases expiring by 2019. But their property transactions have been in limbo because of the uncertainty over the land-use rights.\u201cIf the authorities simply cannot allow for the use of the land without paying a hefty price, then it will be very hard,\u201d said Dali Yang, who teaches at the University of Chicago and has studied property rights in China. \u201cFor many families, it will be a very significant hardship.\u201d\u201cIt will be a huge political liability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will also turn people away, not just against the government, but also against the country, in the sense that some people may decide to throw in the towel and emigrate.\u201dIn 2007, China moved to reassure homeowners by requiring that local governments renew 70-year leases automatically. Yet the law did not make clear whether homeowners would have to pay for the renewal or what would happen to those with shorter leases.In the last two decades, since the government has allowed private homeownership, many people have rushed to buy homes without considering the legal issues governing their limited land-use rights.A majority of them expected the government to grant them full ownership of their homes without repossession or a huge fee to renew their land rights. Those moves could hurt the Chinese property market and anger the middle class, which is an important constituency of the ruling Communist Party and is richer, larger and more aware of its rights than ever before.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loath to Meddle in Election, Obama Delayed Blaming Russia for D.N.C. Hack", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration spent months deliberating whether to blame Russia for a cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee, with action delayed in part because President Obama did not want to be blamed for politicizing intelligence, the White House said on Wednesday.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that \u201cit would\u2019ve been inappropriate for White House figures \u2014 including the president of the United States \u2014 to be rushing the intelligence community to expedite their analysis of the situation.\u201dIn particular, he described White House concerns that any statement by Mr. Obama would be viewed as using intelligence to meddle in the election on behalf of the president\u2019s preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton.An F.B.I. agent initially tried in September 2015 to alert officials from the Democratic National Committee that it was the target of a cyberattack by a group of hackers with links to Russian intelligence. But the administration waited until October 2016, more than a year later and after months of damaging leaks, to confirm that intelligence agencies believed the hacks were the product of a Russian intelligence operation.Part of the reason for the delay, Mr. Earnest said, was bureaucratic. \u201cFirst, they had to confirm across 17 different government agencies that they had high confidence that this is exactly what had transpired,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.But the administration\u2019s delayed response also resulted because Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, had been making repeated claims about how the election was being rigged, and Mr. Obama did not want to do anything that would feed those charges, Mr. Earnest said.When the Obama administration first took office, it was deeply aware of criticism leveled at the prior administration of President George W. Bush that top officials had sought to shape or politicize intelligence conclusions on whether President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had so-called weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Obama has said that he sought from the first days of his presidency to protect the intelligence process from any hint of political interference.So while Mr. Obama in December 2014 personally condemned North Korea\u2019s hack of Sony Pictures, he was far more reluctant to do so when political operatives were the target of a state-sponsored hack during a presidential campaign.\u201cGiven that the president had endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, he believed it was important for the intelligence community to make this announcement,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.The Obama administration has announced that its response to the Russian hack will be proportional and may never be publicly disclosed. Critics say that to discourage further cyberattacks, the administration should have responded quickly and made its response public.But Mr. Earnest cautioned that the United States would be particularly vulnerable in an international cyber-exchange \u201cbecause we rely on 21st-century communications technology for just about everything in a way that lots of other societies and economies and countries don\u2019t.\u201dHe said that much of the damage from the Russian hack resulted from decisions by news organizations to publish emails they knew to be stolen.Advertisement"}

Only 19, Mr. Matabor had waited months for this hearing. He was asking for the right to remain in Europe. His life was in the balance. He stared at the floor, terrified.First came the formalities. Mr. Matabor speaks only Bengali, so an interpreter explained the asylum system to him \u2014 and the possibility that his application could be denied. Then basic questions: Was his name spelled correctly? Was his birth date correct? Did he belong to a certain Bangladeshi ethnic group?\u201cI\u2019m an orphan,\u201d Mr. Matabor replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know my ethnic group.\u201dFor the next 46 minutes, Mr. Matabor sat inside one of Rome\u2019s Territorial Commissions for the Recognition of International Protection and pleaded for asylum to an audience of one \u2014 a smartly dressed Italian civil servant named Giorgio De Francesco. One man asking for protection; another man charged with deciding his fate.But having made it to Europe, many migrants face the challenge of proving they qualify to stay. Public attitudes have hardened against them. Most European economies remain weak and unable to absorb new workers.For the moment, a hierarchy of human misery prevails: People fleeing well-defined conflicts, like the civil war in Syria, or oppressive states, like Eritrea, have a far higher chance of success, while the fate of many others can hinge on their individual stories.Mr. De Francesco\u2019s job amounts to parsing the misery, picking winners and losers from a pool of applicants who had lost so much already.In early May, Mr. De Francesco was busy as I sat in his hearing room and listened to Mr. Matabor tell his life story. Usually, asylum hearings are confidential, but Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry allowed me to attend nearly a dozen hearings this spring so long as I had the permission of the applicants. I then kept up with those applicants as they waited for answers.One Nigerian man, Franck Iyanu, described how thugs had killed his brother as his stepfather tried to steal his land. He feared the police as much as his stepfather.One afternoon, three Syrian families appeared \u2014 part of a group of Syrians whom Pope Francis had brought to Rome from a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. I was one of the reporters traveling with Francis on that trip in April, and the Syrians had clambered onto the papal plane, dazed by their good fortune. Now, I unexpectedly met them again in the hearing room.During his hearing, Mr. Matabor described growing up illiterate in a Bangladeshi orphanage until a family informally adopted him. But the parents died, and he lived with his adoptive brother, a figure in opposition politics. Men came looking for the brother and instead found Mr. Matabor, beating him unconscious and threatening to kill him.Mr. Matabor borrowed money, fled to Libya and worked in a hotel. The hotel was destroyed in Libya\u2019s civil war. He escaped on a smuggler boat and arrived in Italy last year. In his absence, his young wife in Bangladesh had given birth to his son. He has never met the baby.\u201cThey will kill me,\u201d Mr. Matabor said, explaining what would happen if he went back to Bangladesh. \u201cThey want to find my brother, but they will kill me for revenge.\u201dMr. De Francesco listened quietly, typing notes on his computer until the hearing ended and he hit a button. The printer whirred to life, spitting out three pages.Those pieces of paper represented Mr. Matabor\u2019s old life, and would be added to his official application for a new one. He signed his name, and later that day Mr. De Francesco presented the case for a vote to the five-member asylum commission he oversees.The odds were not good: Nearly two-thirds of asylum applicants in Italy are refused asylum or lower levels of protection. Mr. Matabor\u2019s answer would not come until October.During one of his worst days, Mr. De Francesco walked to Piazza della Minerva. There, surrounded by the decaying grandeur of the ancient city, he said, he nearly broke down after hearing the case of a Nigerian woman.\u201cShe had suffered a lot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe had lost her parents. Her family had mistreated her.\u201d He needed to step away to compose himself because he knew he would have to vote against her, and that her application would be denied. \u201cThese are not things that qualify you for international protection,\u201d he said.Mr. De Francesco, 52, grew up in Rome as part of the post-World War II generation, born when an optimistic Europe was rebuilding and the political integration of the Continent was considered the best safeguard against another apocalyptic conflict. He \u201cdreamed of a united Europe, like a federation of states.\u201dTrained as a lawyer, Mr. De Francesco spent years in Italy\u2019s Interior Ministry, writing legislation for Parliament. But as he watched the arrival of migrants stir a political crisis in Europe, Mr. De Francesco requested a transfer to the overworked asylum system.\u201cThe refugee problem is a real emergency,\u201d he said.Now Mr. De Francesco worries that public anxiety over migration is threatening the ideals of the European project. Denmark introduced a much-criticized measure allowing the authorities to seize cash and valuables such as jewelry and wedding rings from asylum seekers as payment for housing them.Yet the question is as much about the quality of the commissions as the quantity, as inconsistencies plague asylum systems in Italy and across Europe.\u201cThe same case can be presented in Britain, and in Italy, and in Germany, and in France \u2014 and there could be four different results,\u201d said Bruce Leimsidor, an expert on European asylum law at Ca\u2019 Foscari University in Venice. \u201cThe same case could be presented to four different commissions in Italy, and you could get four different results.\u201dTo keep pace with an unceasing workload, the five members of Mr. De Francesco\u2019s commission hear cases separately and then present their findings on each case to the full commission for a vote.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have only one person deciding the life of someone else,\u201d said Mario Morcone, the Interior Ministry official who oversees the immigration system.Yet for now, that is close to the reality \u2014 as well as Mr. Francesco\u2019s burden. \u201cI know I will apply the law well,\u201d Mr. De Francesco said.\u201cBut there are certain human cases that don\u2019t fall under the right categories. That hits me hard. That is the hardest thing to do.\u201dOn the morning of May 6, I sat in the asylum hearings of some of the Syrians whom Pope Francis had brought to Rome. For Mr. De Francesco, the Syrians fell directly in the \u201cright categories.\u201d One woman, Wafaa Eid, reached into her bag and presented her Syrian identity card and a packet of documents, which included a short statement of support from the pope.Dressed conservatively in a head scarf and knee-length black sweater, Ms. Eid spoke of how she had fled the outskirts of Damascus with her family and then paid a smuggler in Turkey for passage to Greece. There, to her surprise, the pope scooped them up.\u201cIf we returned to Syria,\u201d she said, \u201cwe would no longer have a home, and we wouldn\u2019t know where to go.\u201dSome asylum hearings last hours. This one lasted 26 minutes.\u201cVery good,\u201d Mr. De Francesco said.Ms. Eid jumped out of her chair.\u201cThank you! Thank you very much!\u201d she said, giddy and smiling.Few people have endured more misery and death in recent years than the Syrians, and earning asylum is mostly a foregone conclusion for them. In Italy, about 90 percent of Syrians were granted protection during the first five months of this year.\u201cFor everyone coming from Syria \u2014 if we are sure they are coming from Syria \u2014 they deserve protection,\u201d Mr. De Francesco told me.Less easily classified are the situations in Nigeria, Gambia, Bangladesh and so many of the countries that are the biggest suppliers of migrants into Italy. Only 2 percent of Nigerian applicants were granted refugee status during the first five months of this year (though others did receive lower levels of protection).Many of these people had been working in Libya during the long dictatorship of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when the country was a destination for laborers from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. But with Libya now in chaos, those workers are fleeing to Italy.Some scholars argue that the definition of a refugee is outdated and should be re-examined. Traditionally, people who leave a country because of poverty are deemed \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and do not qualify for asylum.But new factors, intertwined with poverty, are pushing people to leave, like weak governance or a lawlessness that invites impunity.\u201cWe have a shifting dynamic, where more and more people are fleeing countries that are fragile,\u201d said Alexander Betts, a migration expert at the University of Oxford. \u201cCollectively, the world has a real challenge in how we categorize people who cross international borders.\u201dDr. Betts added: \u201cWe will see displacement and mobility as defining issues of the 21st century.\u201dNanue Matabor, pen in hand, stared blankly at a piece of paper. He was failing Italian class. A teacher stood at the other end of the long table prepping Chinese and African students for an exam. One of Mr. Matabor\u2019s classmates, a migrant from Mali, leaned over and jabbed his finger at the empty paper.Mr. Matabor cannot read or write in Bengali, and his teacher told me that he was often absent from class. The humiliation of trying to learn a second language when you can only speak your first apparently discouraged him.It was June, more than a month since the hearings, and I had gone to Tuscany to visit some of the asylum seekers I had met in Rome. They were living in reception centers run by charities and private entrepreneurs, and studying Italian. But mostly they waited for word on their asylum application.\u201cEat, sleep, eat, sleep,\u201d Mr. Iyanu, one of the Nigerians, said in frustration, describing his daily routine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know when they will call me. I don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Matabor lived in a reception center in the town of Calenzano, not far from Florence, which was run by Caritas, the Catholic charity. Forty migrants slept on bunk beds and took meals of pasta and salad on plastic plates. For midday prayers, Mr. Matabor and other Muslims spread small rugs or towels on the hallway floor. A dirt backyard served as a truncated soccer pitch.Barely three years ago, Italy\u2019s asylum system accommodated about 27,800 people as they waited for resolution of their cases. Today, there are nearly 176,700.For migrants, it is a crapshoot. Some are placed in well-run centers that provide good services and help them prepare for asylum hearings. Others are not. Some have their asylum hearings before well-trained commissions. Others do not.A denial of asylum is not an end to the process. A person can choose to appeal in the Italian legal system, which could take a year or longer.Or a person can simply melt into the streets, without documentation, living illegally. Some have taken up drug dealing. Others sell trinkets on city streets. Still others struggle to subsist, depending on soup kitchens for meals or working illegally for small shops or factories for paltry wages.\u201cOne option is not to have a document and to be a slave here,\u201d Katia Fitermann, a counselor who works with Mr. Matabor and other migrants. \u201cThey get paid two euros an hour. You come out of one exploitative situation and you get back into another one.\u201dMr. Matabor understands the importance of a \u201cyes\u201d from the commission. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give me the document, and I return to Bangladesh, these political people will kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I stay here without a job or documents, it is like dying.\u201dThe first person I heard from was Patrick Yeboah, a Ghanaian who spent nearly three years working construction in Libya.\u201cToday is bad news for me,\u201d he said in an audio file he sent me on WhatsApp on Sept. 20. \u201cI am granted my results. It is negative.\u201dThe two Nigerians, Mr. Iyanu and Monday Osayomwanbor, got the same bad news. The Syrians earned full refugee protection and were settling in Rome.\u201cWe are happy,\u201d Ms. Eid said.For Mr. De Francesco, the applicants kept coming. Since I had left his hearing room in early May, his commission had heard about 1,200 more cases.He knew his job was to uphold the law but still anguished over cases where an applicant had suffered so much yet did not qualify for protection.\u201cThe day I no longer feel that, I\u2019ll ask to stop,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would have lost my humanity.\u201dFinally, on Oct. 6, I went to Florence to meet Mr. Matabor.At the immigration office, Africans, Bangladeshis and Afghans loitered outside. Most of them had waited for months for an asylum decision. It took barely two minutes to receive the answer. One Moroccan woman came out sobbing. A man from Mali came out smiling.Finally, Mr. Matabor went inside. His wife in Bangladesh was waiting for the answer. A minute passed, maybe two, before he walked out, holding a piece of paper. As a translator spoke to other Bangladeshis, explaining the process of appeal, or how the government would buy them a ticket to return to Bangladesh, Mr. Matabor stood alone, his back turned, and quietly cried.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome and Florence, Italy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Whatchamacallit Economy", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt\u2019s a hip, fast-growing sector of the economy, filled with headline-grabbing companies: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Task Rabbit. But there\u2019s a gnawing problem: People aren\u2019t sure what to call it. Many critics dislike the term most commonly used, the \u201csharing economy,\u201d because there often isn\u2019t much actual sharing going on. Others prefer to call it the on-demand economy, peer-to-peer economy, crowd-based economy, gig economy or collaborative economy.Uber, Lyft and other e-hailing companies love to say they are \u201cride-sharing companies,\u201d signaling that they are collaborative and not crassly capitalistic. These companies maintain that their drivers share their cars with passengers and use apps to share information about where they are. But many academics and workers in this sector assert that the business model seems less like sharing than like traditional corporate profit-making that happens to use an app.Rochelle LaPlante, who works for Mechanical Turk, an internet platform for people to post and find piecework jobs, sees public relations spin behind the term \u201csharing economy.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an exchange of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really sharing if a person\u2019s paying for it.\u201dHer point: If you\u2019re living in San Francisco and you want to drive to Palo Alto and take a friend with you (perhaps splitting the cost of gas), that\u2019s ride sharing. But if you take an Uber to get to Palo Alto, that seems more like a taxi ride.Arun Sundararajan, author of the new book \u201cThe Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism,\u201d said he chose that term for his title because so many people use it. Yet Mr. Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, actually prefers \u201ccrowd-based capitalism,\u201d because a crowd of consumers obtains services by connecting, via a platform, with a crowd of suppliers.In the early 2000s, the sharing economy generally referred to people with underused assets \u2014 whether automobiles, homes or vacuum cleaners \u2014 who let others \u201cshare\u201d them, usually for a fee. Such sharing was viewed not as a business but as a way to promote sustainability.\u201cThe \u2018sharing economy\u2019 phrase has stuck,\u201d Professor Sundararajan said, partly because it suggests a personal touch \u2014 say, an Airbnb host putting visitors up in a spare bedroom. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection that people seem to enjoy.\u201d (Even though some say that the Airbnb hosts who own a dozen apartments are not really sharing.)Ms. Botsman added that some companies can legitimately be called sharing companies, like Turo (previously called RelayRides), which enables car owners to rent out their unused cars, and BlaBlaCar, which connects riders with car owners planning to drive from one city to another.With the term \u201csharing economy\u201d under scrutiny, experts are casting about for substitutes. Miriam A. Cherry, a St. Louis University law professor, recommends the \u201con-demand economy,\u201d but critics say that isn\u2019t exact enough, because ordering a pizza by phone can be considered part of an on-demand economy. Others prefer \u201cgig economy,\u201d but some assert that phrase isn\u2019t suitable for 21st-century app-based companies because gig workers \u2014 think jazz musicians \u2014 have been around for decades.Some embrace \u201cplatform economy,\u201d but Geoffrey G. Parker, an engineering professor at Dartmouth and the author of \u201cPlatform Revolution,\u201d says that name is too broad because it includes giants like Google, Facebook and YouTube. Others like the \u201capp-based on-demand economy\u201d (the Abode economy), the \u201cgig on-demand economy\u201d (the GOD economy) or the \u201cplatform on-demand economy\u201d (the POD economy), whose workers could be called pods.Despite the criticism that \u201csharing economy\u201d is inaccurate and sounds like corporate spin, Professor Sundararajan says we might be stuck with that description because corporations and the public so often use it. When Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue latch on to a phrase, it\u2019s not easy to shake it off.Steven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tent Cities of San Francisco", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California may be the new capital of American liberalism, but everybody who likes the sound of that ought to consider the fate of three recent San Francisco ballot initiatives.The first, Proposition Q, aimed to eliminate homeless people\u2019s unsightly tent camps by banning sidewalk tents and empowering the police to confiscate them with 24 hours notice so long as occupants were offered beds in shelters. San Francisco has only 1,203 emergency adult shelter beds, for a homeless population of 6,700, but a second initiative, Proposition J, promised to ease that shortfall by earmarking $50 million a year from a small sales-tax increase, proposed in a third initiative, Proposition K.In an exquisite illustration of California\u2019s core political neurosis \u2014 the tension between our attachment to the pretty view and our desire to care for the least among us without personal inconvenience, even as our population and economy explode \u2014 we San Franciscans voted yes on Q and J, and no on K. The people spoke, in other words, and we said, \u201cGet rid of those filthy tents and set aside heaps of money to make sure it\u2019s done in a compassionate way so I don\u2019t have to feel guilty, but don\u2019t squeeze me for a dime.\u201dSimilar contradictions were on display this month, after the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland killed 36 people. We lamented the deaths, but it was easier to criticize the warehouse owner and operator than face the desperation that drove so many to live there.San Francisco\u2019s homeless population, it bears mentioning, increased less than 7 percent over the last 10 years. Tent camps are nothing new. According to Jeff Kositsky, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, what has changed is their visibility. Tech-boom construction has filled empty lots where people \u201cexperiencing homelessness\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the preferred term \u2014 formerly slept in seclusion.\u201cWe also had one individual purchase and give away $15,000 worth of camping tents,\u201d Mr. Kositsky told me. \u201cOther organizations were giving them out as well, and now we\u2019ve got 80 encampments in the city.\u201d The individual in question turned out to be a graphic designer named Shaun Osburn who told me that, with help from a former taxi driver named Tara Spalty, he gave away more than 350 tents.This camp reportedly had 350 residents at one point, including a slumlord (tentlord?) who rented his spare tents for a few bucks a week. Conventional wisdom holds that such places are populated by drug addicts and the mentally ill, and elements of that camp supported this, from piles of garbage to apparent meth heads toiling over piles of disassembled bicycles. There was something so sane, however, about the tidy rows into which all these tents were arranged that it brought to mind a national-park campground.This resonance was not lost on the tent dwellers. Crystal Erickson, a 36-year-old who had been homeless for three years, told me, ruefully, \u201cWe call it the urban camping experience.\u201dNearby, on Seventh Street, another group built wooden shanties along a narrow strip of concrete between a street that clogs with rush-hour traffic and a railway that roars with commuter trains in the shadow of a sprawling new biotech center. Germaine Spann, a member of this crew, told me that he scavenged materials from the Dumpsters at the immense luxury-condo construction site that loomed overhead. He scaled his boxlike home for legal parking spaces, built it on wheels for easy relocation, installed a lockable door and a glass window, and painted a sign that said: \u201cBox City 7th Street. They may look like boxes to you, but to us they are home.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re ships,\u201d said Jason Albertson, a member of the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team. \u201cEverybody\u2019s building a lifeboat and living in it.\u201dSimilar outbreaks of ad hoc shelter appeared elsewhere around California and, indeed, all over the West Coast and even Hawaii. In Los Angeles, where the total homeless population grew 11 percent from 2015 to 2016 \u2014 to an astonishing 28,464 people \u2014 the number of makeshift dwellings grew 85 percent. In San Diego, the homeless population declined while those in handmade shelters grew 69 percent. Sacramento was so overwhelmed by tent dwellers that the city is contemplating creating a \u201csafe ground\u201d zone, while Santa Barbara has designated \u201csafe parking\u201d lots for people who occupy vehicles.Activists soon gathered signatures for ballot initiatives like Proposition HHH in Los Angeles, which aimed to create a $1.2 billion bond for new supportive and affordable housing as well as facilities, and Measure A in Santa Clara County, which authorized a $950 million bond for affordable housing.Public outcry included disbelief that our wealthy progressive city allows people to suffer so; assertions that our homeless come from elsewhere because of the warm weather and San Francisco\u2019s generous public services; and the notorious \u201cTech Bro\u201d letter of Feb. 15, addressed to the mayor and police chief by an entrepreneur named Justin Keller. Mr. Keller announced that he had been living in San Francisco \u201cfor over three years,\u201d declared homelessness \u201cthe worst it has ever been,\u201d and shrugged off culpability as an agent of gentrification.Mr. Kositsky, the city official, did not entirely disagree. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to demonize people who complain, who want their kids safe and don\u2019t want to step on needles and feces and be kept up all night by loud music,\u201d he told me.Patrick Kennedy, a developer, proposed solving the problem with micro-apartments that look like shipping containers (fabrication to be outsourced to China, of course), stacked into supportive communities, and rented to the city at $1,000 a month. Meanwhile, with the financial backing of wealthy investors, Supervisor Mark Farrell, a moderate who represents affluent neighborhoods, placed Proposition Q on the ballot.Mr. Keller seems like a smart fellow. He has doubtless learned by now that homelessness is decidedly not the worst it has ever been in San Francisco and also that it ranks up there with sunshine among California\u2019s defining phenomena. As The San Francisco Chronicle reported in October, the South of Market district favored by tech firms like Mr. Keller\u2019s has been a gathering place for the homeless since at least 1872, when an observer noted the concentration of \u201cblanket men\u201d who seemed to be mostly \u201crunaway sailors,\u201d \u201cold soldiers\u201d and \u201cbankrupt German scene painters.\u201d The city\u2019s homeless population peaked at 8,640 in 2002.Californian outrage over homelessness is likewise evergreen, as documented by the journalist Caleb Pershan, who found examples that ranged from a 1986 Chronicle columnist\u2019s comment that \u201cthe annual homeless crisis came to San Francisco early this year\u201d to a 2001 article mocking Mayor Willie Brown\u2019s belated acknowledgment that homelessness harmed the city\u2019s image \u2014 \u201cstunning the many merchants and residents who have been sounding that theme since the beginning of the mayor\u2019s first term six years ago.\u201dMr. Keller is less an outlier rube, in other words, than a genuine Californian, struggling to reconcile the Golden State of our shared dreams with unsettling evidence. Grumblings that our homeless come from elsewhere for services express that denial by insisting that we are too compassionate \u2014 not inadequately so \u2014 and therefore bear no responsibility for losers who wash up on our sidewalks. It is not immaterial that newcomers really do keep showing up in droves, in California, and that people who got here yesterday have a long history of feeling unnerved by those who arrived 10 minutes ago. Dust Bowl migrants, for example, were so resented that legislators passed a 1937 \u201canti-Okie\u201d law a that criminalized the bringing of \u201cany indigent person\u201d into California.San Francisco city statistics, meanwhile, suggest that most of our homeless are as Californian as anyone with a roof over their heads. A one-night census of the homeless in January 2015 found that 71 percent had lived here at the time they became homeless, and half of those had lived in San Francisco for 10 or more years.I recently heard a tech-industry veteran \u2014 a friend, born on the East Coast \u2014 suggest that proposals to build low-income housing here were misguided because of the high cost of California real estate. A more efficient alternative, he explained, would be to construct homeless shelters somewhere cheap, like Nevada. Aside from the unpleasant specter of the police forcing desperate mothers and children onto buses bound for desert concentration camps (and how long would you have to be homeless to get exiled?), my friend\u2019s remark helped me see what lurks beneath Mr. Keller\u2019s contention that wealthy people have a right to be here because they \u201cgot an education, work hard, and earned it.\u201dAmericans have been coming to California to make it big for so long \u2014 on wagons bound for the Gold Rush, via Route 66 for 1950s aerospace jobs \u2014 that a tacit understanding flourishes in certain quarters by which California is less a homeland full of locals like anywhere else than a reality show with a self-deportation approach to voting contestants off the island. As soon as you can\u2019t pay the bills, and regardless of whether your great-grandparents were born here, you\u2019re expected to get lost, or at least move to Seattle.Discussion of causes, along with the noise about weather and drug addiction, typically includes Ronald Reagan\u2019s evisceration of federal funding for subsidized housing and public mental health hospitals. Conventional homeless shelters get blamed, too, because of their tendency to separate romantic partners and forbid both pets and the storage of belongings \u2014 such that a few nights indoors might cost a person love, companionship and all their survival gear.Frigid New York City, however, has more homeless per capita than San Francisco or Los Angeles, while only 7 percent of Los Angeles homeless arrived less than a year ago, fewer than the 8.5 percent of all Los Angeles County residents to have done so, suggesting that sunshine is no more of an inducement to the destitute than to anyone else. National surveys also find that 20 percent to 25 percent of the homeless have serious mental health problems and an estimated 26 percent abuse drugs. San Francisco has also pioneered a new model of homeless shelter, known as a Navigation Center, that invites entire encampments \u2014 pets included \u2014 to come in from the cold together.The economic factors that correlate most strongly with homelessness, furthermore, according to research published in 2001 by the Public Policy Institute of California, are precisely those that bedevil every aspect of California life: extreme income inequality combined with upward-spiraling housing costs. For decades, even as employment booms have led to population booms, California voters \u2014 myself among them \u2014 have fought to freeze the good life in amber by resisting increases in housing density and mass transit.Viewed in this light, sidewalk tents are merely a rational response to an incoherent society.Californians came together for public works in the mid-20th century \u2014 freeways, public housing, the finest public schools and universities in the nation. Caring for the least among us, however, has never been a hallmark of California liberalism, and our most notable innovations of the past 50 years have been more about environmental conservation, tolerance and technology \u2014 sustainable agriculture, gay marriage, Snapchat \u2014 than formation of mutual aid societies, except for communes and cults that end with industrial-scale marijuana cultivation or mass suicide. The technology industry takes this to a millennial extreme by celebrating the moral neutrality enshrined in Google\u2019s corporate motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil.\u201dOn the upside, our political leaders \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown chief among them \u2014 see with clarity that our only defensible path forward involves the end of Nimby resistance to change and the mass construction of denser housing and public transit guided by enlightened city planning to create a more livable and sustainable future. Voters all over California did pass big bond measures in support of new housing for the homeless, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, recently made a $10 million gift meant to eliminate family homelessness in San Francisco. Facebook has likewise announced plans to create 1,500 units of housing near its Menlo Park headquarters \u2014 a colossal political breakthrough, in our stunted moral climate \u2014 with 15 percent designated affordable and $20 million dedicated to the development of still more affordable housing and tenants\u2019 rights services.In the meantime, San Francisco city employees can start giving all those tent dwellers 24 hours notice to clear out, backed by offers of, well, pretty much nothing at all.Advertisement"}

The attitude of Congress in their vote the other night shows their fear.\u201dMs. Rousseff\u2019s supporters contend that her rivals impeached her primarily to thwart the investigation into extensive corruption at the national oil company, Petrobras. Indeed, some of Mr. Temer\u2019s cabinet ministers have been caught in secret recordings discussing how to derail the inquiry, with one explicitly describing Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster as a way to impede federal prosecutors.But while Ms. Rousseff is gone, the investigation is not. Politicians are now growing especially jittery over a pending plea deal by executives from a giant Brazilian construction company at the center of the case.According to leaks of testimony, executives from the company, Odebrecht \u2014 including Marcelo Odebrecht, the former chief executive now serving a 19-year prison term \u2014 are expected to reveal a web of bribes and kickbacks involving dozens of federal legislators and other prominent political leaders.Odebrecht issued a statement on Thursday apologizing for its misdeeds, while Brazilian news organizations reported that the company had agreed to pay about $2 billion as part of the leniency agreement.With tempers flaring and suspicions high, Brazilian politicians have turned to a trusty way of protecting themselves and betraying one another: secret recordings.At each major turn in Brazil\u2019s political crisis in the past year, the recordings are revealing tactics that would make Machiavelli proud.But after Ms. Rousseff was first suspended from office in May \u2014 on charges of manipulating the budget to hide economic problems \u2014 it turned out that Brazil\u2019s double-crossing political class was just getting warmed up.S\u00e9rgio Machado, the chief executive of a subsidiary of the national oil company, revealed that he had been recording conversations with an array of leaders in Mr. Temer\u2019s party, including Jos\u00e9 Sarney, a former president, and Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate.\u201cThis thing with the recordings shows that trust in politics is in extremely short supply,\u201d said Antonio Jos\u00e9 Valverde, a professor of ethics and political philosophy at Catholic University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe best allegory for this moment is an image circulating on the internet: rats devouring the flag of Brazil.\u201dSome Brazilians had hoped that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment would calm the political system, enabling leaders to focus on mending an economy enduring its worst crisis in decades. This week, the authorities disclosed that gross domestic product shrank 2.9 percent in the third quarter from the same period last year, plunging the country deeper into a slump.But the political drama of recent days has raised concerns that the scandals could distract the authorities from focusing on the economy. On Thursday, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Calheiros, the powerful chief of the Senate and an ally of Mr. Temer, should stand trial on graft charges.Marcelo Calero, Mr. Temer\u2019s culture minister, said shortly after stepping down last month that the president had pressured him to overrule a historical preservation measure that was halting the construction of a luxury tower in the northeastern city of Salvador.Geddel Vieira Lima, a top political ally of Mr. Temer who held the title of government secretary, one of the most influential posts in the cabinet, had invested in an apartment in the building and wanted construction to proceed.Mr. Calero sought to justify recording the president as a \u201cprocedural issue.\u201dMr. Temer is now facing the most acute crisis of his short presidency, but few observers see him at any imminent risk of falling. His government\u2019s coalition still controls Congress. The calls for his impeachment are coming from parties in the opposition. Mr. Temer has argued that he was merely seeking a \u201ctechnical\u201d solution for the problem in his cabinet involving Mr. Lima, who has also resigned.But with technology advancing to the point where just about anyone with a smartphone can secretly record an office conversation, nerves are fraying about such betrayals in Brazil\u2019s increasingly paranoid political establishment.\u201cI joke that the only safe place for a conversation between politicians is in the swimming pool, where recording equipment obviously cannot function,\u201d said Renato Janine Ribeiro, a former education minister in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government who is also a professor of political philosophy at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.Paula Moura and Claire Rigby contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Royal Family Is Still Spending in an Age of Austerity", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported bySecrets of the KingdomTANGIER, Morocco \u2014 Behind a tall perimeter wall, studded with surveillance cameras and guarded by Moroccan soldiers, a sprawling new palace for King Salman of Saudi Arabia rose on the Atlantic coast here last summer.Even as the Saudi government canceled a quarter of a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of projects back home as part of a fiscal austerity program, workers hustled to finish bright blue landing pads for helicopters at the vacation compound and to erect a tent the size of a circus big-top where the king could feast and entertain his enormous retinue.The royal family\u2019s fortune derives from the reserves of petroleum discovered during the reign of Salman\u2019s father, King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, more than 75 years ago. The sale of oil provides billions of dollars in annual allowances, public-sector sinecures and perks for royals, the wealthiest of whom own French chateaus and Saudi palaces, stash money in Swiss bank accounts, wear couture dresses under their abayas and frolic on some of the world\u2019s biggest yachts out of sight of commoners.\u201cThe people have less money than before, but the royal family have the same,\u201d said Prince Khalid bin Farhan al-Saud, a dissident member of the extended family living in Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of state money which is concealed from the budget, which is determined by the king alone.\u201dThese are anxious times for the royals, led by an 80-year-old who has already had at least one stroke and is likely to be the last of six sons of the founding monarch to serve as sovereign. He must wrangle a band of relatives, from the merely well-off to billionaires, who are accustomed from birth to privilege and plenty.While there are serious problems beyond the borders \u2014 a costly war in Yemen, violence in Iraq and Syria, an emboldened Iran \u2014 it is the country\u2019s economic troubles that risk roiling ordinary citizens, if their own cradle-to-grave benefits are cut too much. Many royals are wary of any disclosures about their wealth that could provoke public criticism.Revenues from the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, have long been the lifeblood of government spending. Some in the family have resisted a proposal by the king\u2019s son Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to partly privatize it, since listing it on stock exchanges in New York or London would bring new audits of Aramco and possibly more insights into government funding, and in turn, money for the royals.That concern has led some senior family members to quietly explore alternatives to the privatization plan, though Saudi officials said it remains on track.Facing huge budget gaps, the government has cut public-sector pay along with subsidies, sending gasoline, electricity and even water bills higher. The kingdom has begun borrowing by the billions both at home and abroad. And hiring by the government \u2014 a large and sought after employer for Saudis \u2014 has been cut, instilling fear for the future in younger people who cannot find work.Royals are sharing the pain, according to Anas al-Qusayer, the spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and Information, who said that their allowances had been reduced. At least some royals, though, have seen no decline in their stipends, according to several Saudis close to the family.Some Saudi royals are still spending big. Dania Sinno, a real estate agent with Belles Demeures de France, said that multiple family members had been buying property in Paris in the last year. She recently sold a nearly 11,000-square-foot apartment on the exclusive Rue Octave-Feuillet for more than $30 million to a Saudi princess.The king, of course, does not lack for options at home, with a network of marble-columned palaces and countryside retreats stretching from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. But the Tangier compound appears to be his current favorite getaway.During his visit this summer, some hundred black Mercedes sedans and Range Rovers were waiting to chauffeur the royal party around town. The palace complex includes its own medical facilities and top-flight restaurant kitchens that turn out dishes with lobster, caviar and truffles flown in from France.Some on the household staff, who did not want to be identified so they could continue working for the Saud family, said they received an unusual gratuity when they handed in their ID badges: a free trip for a pilgrimage to Mecca.Salman bin Abdulaziz was born in 1935, just three years after his father proclaimed the new Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The power and legitimacy of the new state rested on the twin pillars of the royal family and their allies in the ultraconservative Wahhabi religious leadership. Oil, discovered in the country\u2019s east in 1938, provided a growing source of funding for both.As a young prince, Salman recalled when the family still lived in tents part of the year, as he has recounted to Secretary of State John Kerry. He could not have assumed as a boy that he would someday rule his father\u2019s dominion. King Abdulaziz entered into numerous marriages \u2014 with 17 known wives, producing at least 36 sons \u2014 to cement alliances with the many Arabian tribes.Salman, believed to be the 25th son, had one advantage in this sprawling, competitive family, where royal succession does not always follow a straight line. His mother, Hassa al-Sudairi, was a favorite wife of the king, and Salman was one of seven full brothers, a powerful bloc known as the Sudairi Seven.In contrast to the traditional robes and headdresses King Salman wears in public today, an early photo shows a dapper young man in a well-cut Western suit. In nearly half a century as governor of Riyadh, he presided over the explosion of a modest desert way station into a metropolis with millions of inhabitants, along with skyscrapers, multilane highways and palaces for the newly rich royals.The global shock of the oil embargo in 1973 sent prices soaring and petrodollars flooding into the country. Despite imposing rigid adherence to a strict version of Islam on their subjects, some Saudi princes became fixtures at high-rolling pleasure capitals like Monte Carlo.Through dozens of interviews with diplomats and money managers, economists, real-estate and travel agents, interior decorators and members of the House of Saud and by reviewing court records and real-estate documents, The New York Times has pieced together details of the family\u2019s spending.The scale of the clan\u2019s fortune is a closely guarded secret. The money is divided among many relatives and spread across several continents, making a precise accounting difficult. The funding mechanisms are opaque by design. The share of the Saudi budget that ultimately makes its way into royal coffers is not disclosed. Even people who closely follow the Saudi royal family said they could not estimate its total assets.While chinks in the wall of secrecy appear through legal cases and tabloid reports overseas, the royals have learned not to flaunt their wealth before the nation\u2019s 30 million commoners. The family members have erected high walls around their palaces, bought overseas assets with shell companies, used intermediaries for large investments and demanded nondisclosure agreements from employees.Saudi Arabia is not nearly as affluent on a per-capita basis as Qatar or Kuwait, which are also rich from oil and gas but support far fewer people than their large neighbor. (Both also have been hit hard by the low oil prices.) Despite a robust social safety net \u2014 including free education and health care \u2014 there are poor Saudis, and many in the middle class barely make ends meet.Princes and princesses can take advantage of privileges like special hospital wings decorated like palaces with five-star hotel service, and royal airport terminals with enormous chandeliers, intricate tilework and rich carpets. But even among royals, there are big differences between direct heirs to the kings and cousins on the fringes. Some younger princes live in large, but not palatial, modernist homes outside Riyadh that would not be out of place in upscale California neighborhoods. They drive Range Rovers and boxy Mercedes S.U.V.s rather than the Lamborghini or Bugatti supercars their better-off cousins race around the Knightsbridge section of London.But the Saudi ministry spokesman, Mr. Qusayer, said there were no more than 5,000 members of the House of Saud. The difference may stem in part from whether or how one counts distant relatives and families who ruled back before the time of King Abdulaziz, the current king\u2019s father.At some point, the family could grow too large to support. \u201cThere has to be some decision about lopping off some of the branches,\u201d said F. Gregory Gause III, a Middle East specialist at the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government and Public Service.Members of the royal family rely on allowances, government jobs and positions in business, aided by the status and connections conferred by nobility. Exactly how benefits are parceled out beyond seniority and service is unknown, said Mr. Kechichian, who is a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.\u201cWhat we do know is that the monarch has, for lack of a better term, let\u2019s say petty cash to distribute to various members of the family for their projects, for their businesses, for their life,\u201d he said in an interview.The stipends then ranged from up to $270,000 a month for a son of the founding king to $8,000 a month for his great-great-grandchildren, the official reported. Bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were given to some royals as wedding gifts for palace construction. The official estimated in a memorandum, released with other documents by WikiLeaks five years ago, that the allowances, which included payments to other prominent families around the kingdom, accounted for roughly $2 billion of the government\u2019s total $40 billion budget, or 5 percent of all public spending.The Saudi spokesman, Mr. Qusayer, said that the current total for annual allowances did not exceed 10 billion riyals, or $2.7 billion. The largest share, he added, went to tribal and provincial leaders, not royals.\u201cThose who are familiar with the Saudi social hierarchy know very well that the thousands of tribes\u2019 leaders and provinces\u2019 notables spend directly and indirectly most of their allowances on hundreds of thousands of people they are responsible for,\u201d he wrote.The United States memo cited Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire investor, as having told the American ambassador that revenue from one million barrels of oil per day went into off-budget programs under the control of the king and several top princes.An adviser to several members of the family and a former senior American government official said that the off-budget programs still existed; it is unclear in what amounts. Both spoke only on the condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating the Saudi government. Mr. Qusayer said that \u201cwhatever is generated from Aramco is directed to the state\u2019s public treasury.\u201dThe line between family and state assets can be blurry. United States officials have described in multiple memorandums significant land transfers to sons and grandsons of the king, and even outright grabs, such as one prince who simply had the fence line around his property slowly expand outward to encompass another 30 square miles.\u201cIf you tell me that building this whole country, and spending $350 billion out of $400 billion, that we had misused or got corrupted with $50 billion, I\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take that anytime.\u201dMany royals have succeeded in business by acting as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. Others are involved in enterprises that depend on government spending doled out by relatives or that thrive on heavy state subsidies.\u201cAs long as the royal family views this country as \u2018Al Saud Inc.,\u2019 ever increasing numbers of princes and princesses will see it as their birthright to receive lavish dividend payments, and dip into the till from time to time, by sheer virtue of company ownership,\u201d the American embassy official concluded.As the size of the family and the general population have grown, some observers say, the balance of rewards has become harder to maintain.\u201cAt the top level, they know that they have to leave something for the rest of the country; otherwise they\u2019ll be out on their ear,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, senior fellow at the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council, said of the royal family. \u201cIf you ask the population to make sacrifices in order for the state to get money, you can\u2019t have one part of the society take advantage.\u201dWhen Salman\u2019s half brother King Abdullah ascended to the throne in 2005, he tried to rein in some family excesses. Thousands of princes and princesses had free cellphones disconnected. Unlimited flights on the national airline, Saudia, were cut back so that large entourages no longer traveled gratis and blocks of tickets were no longer resold for profit.Suites at hotels in Jidda, paid year-round by the government, were relinquished. King Abdullah also tried to reduce the practice of land-grabbing and the abuse of the visa system for guest workers. Some princes received block grants of visas and profited from selling them to the workers cooking, cleaning and building across the kingdom.Among those who opposed King Abdullah in paring back privileges and entitlements, according to diplomatic cables, were Prince Salman and his brother Prince Nayef. The princes\u2019 older full brother, Crown Prince Sultan, told them that challenging the king was a \u201cred line.\u201d If the family did not stick together, he warned, it would mean trouble for all of them.Senior members of the House of Saud are keenly aware that they lost their previous kingdom in the 19th century because of family infighting. King Saud was deposed in 1964 and replaced by his brother King Faisal, who, in turn, was assassinated by a nephew.As governor of Riyadh, Salman helped oversee the family, even maintaining a jail for young princes who ran amok. \u201cWhen there was a problem in the family, misbehavior by one of the sons, the person invariably called upon to conciliate and solve the problem was Salman,\u201d said the former United States ambassador Chas W. Freeman Jr., who knew him in Riyadh.Salman, who succeeded Abdullah in January 2015, bestowed an estimated $32 billion on his subjects, including bonuses of two months\u2019 salary to government employees. Oil prices had begun their precipitous decline, but it was not yet clear how far they would fall.Three months later, the king promoted his nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, now 57, as the first crown prince among the founding king\u2019s grandsons, and his own son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now 31, as next in line. The king surprised his court by giving his son broad power, naming him defense minister, head of the economic council and ultimately responsible for Aramco. He also removed several sons of former kings from important positions.\u201cYou have resentment in other branches of the family at their sudden disempowerment,\u201d said Mr. Freeman, the former ambassador.Last year, an anonymous letter by a nephew of the monarch was published online, calling on his uncles to remove their brother, King Salman. In a second letter a couple of weeks later, the prince claimed that $100 billion had been given to the new king\u2019s sons, while the proceeds of two million barrels of oil a day were in the deputy crown prince\u2019s hands.Mr. Qusayer, the Saudi spokesman, said that information was wrong. He said that the prince\u2019s \u201cwords were manipulated\u201d and that a dissident in London had written the letter.The Saud clan remains quietly at odds over how to proceed, with doubts about Prince Mohammed\u2019s economic reform plans and his stewardship of the war in Yemen.\u201cThe family always wants to be unified, so even if they are unhappy, they are trying to stay unified,\u201d said a senior prince who is the son of a former king, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from others in the family.Indeed, criticizing the monarchy carries risks. Three princes who were living abroad and had spoken out against Saudi policy have disappeared from view since King Salman came to power. They are believed to be back in Saudi Arabia, where they cannot voice their disagreements. (The Saudi spokesman said they were not in jail or under house arrest.)While members of the family have been investing overseas for decades, the pace of buying homes abroad has quickened in the last two years, according to Ardavan Amir-Aslani, a business lawyer who has advised Saudi princes on real estate acquisitions in France. \u201cIn the event the situation becomes dire for them, they want to have an option, and a place to go to live, a place to have assets,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not only securing their capital,\u201d he added, \u201cbut also their future lives.\u201dAfter Ramadan ended in July, many royals traveled to the Mediterranean. Prince Abdulaziz, the son of the late King Fahd, rode a Jet Ski this past summer off the Spanish island of Formentera within sight of his nearly 500-foot yacht.Prince Khalid, the exiled prince in Germany, said it would be difficult for the deputy crown prince, who has led the austerity drive, to squeeze his most important constituency if he wishes to reach the throne. \u201cHe won\u2019t be king without the support of the royal family,\u201d he said.Predictions that divisions within the House of Saud could jeopardize its grip on power have come and gone for decades. Despite his advancing age, King Salman emerged this month for a tour of the Persian Gulf states, a reminder of who is in charge.\u201cSwim together or sink together,\u201d he said, \u201cis ingrained in their DNA.\u201dNicholas Kulish reported from Tangier, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.

(Virginia was a distant second.)From 1919 to 1952, California\u2019s state homes and hospitals sterilized about 20,000 people under eugenics laws that were intended to cure societal ills by halting the procreation of people deemed inferior.California officially apologized in 2003. Yet the victims were never compensated.Now, after several years of scholarly detective work, a team of researchers have created a detailed catalog of the California victims. Analyzing the data, they estimate that as many as 831 individuals, with an average age of 88, could still be alive.Patient records showed how the eugenics program was driven by the prejudices of the day. Poor people and the offspring of immigrants were more likely to be sterilized. Criminality and promiscuity were cited as justifications.\u201cSly, profane, obstinate, stealthy, dangerous to public health, low idea of morality, mentally below par,\u201d reads the 1926 case file of one woman who was selected for sterilization at Sonoma State Home in Eldridge.He said the new catalog \u2014 which includes names, birth dates and other personal information \u2014 could help solve that problem.

Other victims spoke of an abiding sorrow over their inability to have children.\u201cI see all my friends and they have children,\u201d one woman was quoted as saying. \u201cI love kids. Sometime now when I babysit, I hold the baby up to myself and think to myself, \u2018Why was I ever sterilized?\u2019\u201dIn the 1990s, Humboldt County was deeply divided over the cutting of its ancient redwoods.Environmental activists chained themselves to trees, blocked logging roads and held sit-ins at the offices of the Pacific Lumber Company, which had extensive timber holdings in the county.It was this week in 1999 that Ms. Hill finally came down from her 180-foot perch after a deal was reached to permanently protect the tree (which she named Luna).For 738 days in the tree, also known as the Stafford Giant, Ms. Hill survived on supplies hoisted by supporters and endured at times harsh weather, illness and loneliness.She proved an effective campaigner, writing letters and taking interviews.

Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations.The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world\u2019s most valuable company and one of China\u2019s largest retailers.The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple\u2019s best-selling and most profitable product.It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as \u201ciPhone City.\u201dThe local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants.It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets.All of it in support of iPhone production.\u201cWe needed something that could really develop this part of the country,\u201d said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in China: \u2018If you build the nest, the birds will come.\u2019 And now, they\u2019re coming.\u201dAmerican officials have long decried China\u2019s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China\u2019s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country.Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world.But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate \u2014 and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves.China\u2019s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world\u2019s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn.While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China\u2019s importance to American technology companies \u2014 and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple\u2019s consumer sales.A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren\u2019t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren\u2019t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn\u2019s negotiations.The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their \u201csupport\u201d for iPhone production, calling the benefits a \u201cpreferential policy.\u201d The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports.As China\u2019s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company\u2019s size and scale \u2014 and the sway that they afford in China \u2014 is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple\u2019s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn\u2019s largest customer.The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn\u2019s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world\u2019s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here.In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government\u2019s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner.Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was \u201cno different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.\u201dA growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China.China, no longer content with just being the world\u2019s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny.The two countries are playing a high-stakes game.As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs.As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store.Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone.The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation.The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn\u2019s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year.The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.Apple was late to China.In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company\u2019s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated.Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them \u2014 in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity.\u201cThis is a machine that is made in America,\u201d Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer.Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how.Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths \u2014 design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost.\u201cThey have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple\u2019s growth,\u201d said Joe O\u2019Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia.When Apple\u2019s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn\u2019s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.Foxconn\u2019s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.\u201cThe reason Foxconn\u2019s so big is Terry Gou,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. \u201cHe said he\u2019d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.\u201dAfter the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China \u2014 unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations.\u201cThese have become like Olympic competitions,\u201d said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China\u2019s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters.City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers.The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory.\u201cWe know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,\u201d said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park.\u201cI was impressed,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. \u201cThey were very focused.\u201dWhen Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers.But Apple initially had to take the \u201cHong Kong U-turn\u201d to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers.Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government\u2019s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands.Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports \u2014 hence, the U-turn employed by many companies.In 2005, Apple\u2019s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country\u2019s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China.\u201cThis was really a legacy of China\u2019s old export-oriented economy,\u201d said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. \u201cBack then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.\u201dApple and other multinationals wanted a better system.By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country.In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city\u2019s airport, to expedite Apple\u2019s global shipments.Although it wasn\u2019t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturing facility.A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world.As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple\u2019s global tax strategy.In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically.The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company\u2019s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China.\u201cU.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cIn doing so, they create stateless income \u2014 income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.\u201dAccording to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the \u201choly grail of tax avoidance.\u201d The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period.Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union.In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city\u2019s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends.In August 2014, the city\u2019s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss \u201cdeepening collaboration\u201d with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the \u201cbiggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.\u201dThere were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation\u2019s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city\u2019s tax revenue was rapidly rising.Officials had a name for it all: \u201cZhengzhou Speed.\u201dA crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab.They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones \u2014 up to 350 a minute.Apple\u2019s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government.As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers.\u201cEvery city\u2019s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,\u201d said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou.The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. \u201cIf the demand is high, then they will pay more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.\u201dCities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don\u2019t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China.As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology.To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China\u2019s State Council, the country\u2019s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters.The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue.\u201cThe government wants to know what you can give to China,\u201d said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. \u201cAnd they have the market and the muscle. They\u2019re not playing around anymore.\u201dChinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price.Apple has agreed to the government\u2019s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo \u201csecurity audits\u201d on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product.Mr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple\u2019s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country\u2019s top leaders, including Mr. Xi.In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a \u201cpillar of its environmental strategy.\u201d He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple\u2019s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing.At the Hall of Purple Light in the government\u2019s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company\u2019s first research and development center in the country and to support the government\u2019s big focus on high-end manufacturing.Opposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou. Also present was the party leader of the province where Zhengzhou is located, Xie Fuzhan.Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting from Zhengzhou, China.

{"Headline": "Clean Energy \u2018Moving Forward\u2019 Despite Trump\u2019s E.P.A. Pick, Experts Say", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice of a fossil-fuel advocate and climate-change denier to head the Environmental Protection Agency comes at a moment when the American energy market has already shifted away from the most polluting fossil fuels, driven more by investors and economics than by federal regulations.Those market forces could make Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to create at least half a million energy jobs a year in the nation\u2019s coal mines and oil shale fields all but impossible.But if Mr. Trump\u2019s promised jobs are unlikely to materialize, the impact on the planet from his policies would be significant. Without additional government policies, energy and environmental experts say, the shift from coal, oil and natural gas will not be rapid or substantial enough to stave off the worst impacts of a warming atmosphere, including rising sea levels, more powerful storms, more devastating droughts and food and water shortages.\u201cThe good news is that on its own, the U.S. economy has become less carbon intensive, and that trend will continue overall,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. The bad news, he said, is that markets alone will not lower emissions enough to offset the worst impacts of global warming.President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan was already criticized for not doing enough. Even if the plan was implemented, it would not reach the targets set under last year\u2019s Paris climate change accord, which committed nearly every country to take action to curb global warming. The targets \u201cwill be unachievable,\u201d Mr. Stavins said.\u201cMr. Pruitt will be deeply involved in the implementation of President-elect Trump\u2019s energy plan, which will move America toward energy independence, create millions of new jobs and protect clean air and water,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMr. Pruitt will ensure that we conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources, while unleashing an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.\u201dThat rebalancing of priorities, the president-elect said, will create \u201cat least a half million jobs each year\u201d and \u201c$30 billion in higher wages.\u201dA Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions.The irony of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s zeal to target President Obama\u2019s climate change and environmental rules, which focus on reducing carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, is that many of the nation\u2019s largest electric utilities \u2014 the entities that would be regulated under the plan \u2014 have already begun plans to shutter coal plants and build new wind and solar farms.Even the chief executives of coal companies agree that Mr. Pruitt can only do so much to restore the industry.Mr. Pruitt \u201cis going to do what needs to be done at the E.P.A. \u2014 to cut the numbers of bureaucrats there who have done nothing but write regulations daily, and send them back to the radical environmentalists who wrote them,\u201d said Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of the Ohio-based Murray Energy Corporation.However, he added, \u201cCoal can\u2019t come back to where it was.\u201dThe plummeting cost of wind and solar energy, helped along by federal tax incentives, has led to a boom in the use of such \u201cno-carbon\u201d power sources. And the nation\u2019s largest electric utilities, many of which have joined Mr. Pruitt in his lawsuit against the climate regulations, have at the same time realigned their long-term investment strategies.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Nicholas Akins, chief executive officer of American Electric Power, an Ohio-based electric utility that generates power in 11 states, said in an interview shortly after Election Day that his company is making investments in energy generation aimed at 20, 30 and 40 years from now. Whether or not Mr. Trump dismantles the Clean Power Plan, he said he assumes that in the long run, carbon pollution will eventually be regulated.\u201cClean Power Plan or not, there will be something in the future on carbon control. So there\u2019s no question that the industry is moving forward with cleaner energy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be building large coal facilities. We\u2019re not stopping what we\u2019re doing based on the new administration. We need to make long-term capital decisions. I don\u2019t think the course will change.\u201dBut company-driven shifts alone will still not be enough to create the steep drop-off in carbon pollution that scientists say is necessary. The use of wind power grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and the end of 2015, while the use of large-scale solar grew by more than 20 times in that same period, according to the Energy Information Administration. But renewable sources, excluding hydroelectric power, still only represent a small fraction of the American energy economy, providing just a little more than 7 percent of the country\u2019s electricity.Carbon dioxide emissions peaked in 2007 at six billion metric tons, declining slightly to 5.4 billion metric tons by 2014. But they would need to decline to about 4.8 billion metric tons annually by 2025 and 1.2 billion metric tons annually by 2050 if the United States is to meet its pledges under the Paris accord.\u201cTo get there would require reducing emissions about 5 percent per year over the next decades. In order to reduce that fast, we would need to be avoiding new fossil fuel infrastructure and actively shutting down old fossil fuel infrastructure before the end of its natural life,\u201d said Andrew Jones, the director of Climate Interactive, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible without aggressive federal policy.\u201dAt the same time, analysts are skeptical that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back the climate change rules would bring back the tens of thousands of mining jobs that have been lost in the market shift away from coal, let alone create large numbers of new jobs. Electric utilities like American Electric Power turned away from investing in coal largely because of the glut of cheap natural gas, thanks to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\u201cThe market defines the opportunities for coal,\u201d said Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan research firm. \u201cElectric utilities that have shut down coal plants are not going to reopen them. Mines that have been mothballed because they are not economic are not going to be taken out of mothballs.\u201dHe said coal could at least remain a part of America\u2019s energy mix if Mr. Pruitt made headway in removing cumbersome regulations \u2014 and if he could successfully strip away subsidies for renewables. Last year, the federal government paid out $2.2 billion in tax incentives to the industry and $1 billion to the solar industry. The wind incentive is set to start declining in value next year until it ends in 2020, while the investment credit for solar is to phase out between 2019 and 2022.\u201cWe\u2019re paying taxes to manufacture windmills. You give me billions of dollars, and I\u2019ll create jobs,\u201d Mr. Murray, the coal company executive, said.But despite the opposition of the coal industry and incoming administration to climate change policy, the tax incentives, which have been enacted by Congress in both Democratic and Republican majorities for over a decade, are unlikely to disappear. Among their greatest beneficiaries are the windswept, sun-soaked districts in Republican strongholds like Kansas, Texas and Arizona, and Rust Belt districts that manufacture wind turbines and solar panels.\u201cI don\u2019t see those renewable tax incentives going away anytime soon,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201cVoters in many of these Trump districts are benefiting from them.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi, Diane Cardwell and Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Few Questions for Poetry", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s TakeWhy Poetry? Well, yes. Most books of poetry sell a couple of thousand copies, at best. So in a quantitative sense, what\u2019s the point of supporting it? With dollars or sense? Would we make the same argument for investing in an endangered species? Like the great Indian bustard, one of the heaviest flying birds, down to a couple of hundred of its kind.The issue is larger than the number of collections of poetry sold each year. It\u2019s about the language \u2014 our language. Is it, too, endangered? If the depleted language of emails and texts and Twitter is any indication, then there\u2019s a case to be made that it might be.Still, a question I often ask myself is why so many people (and we\u2019re now talking about millions of people) turn to poetry for all important rites of passage \u2014 weddings, funerals, toasts, tragedies, eulogies, birthdays. .\u2008.\u2008. Why? Because the language of poetry avoids the quotidian \u2014 but the best poetry simultaneously celebrates the quotidian. Language that\u2019s focused in such a way that true meaning and emotion is redolent in the air. The poet W.S. Merwin once said: \u201cPoetry addresses individuals in their most intimate, private, frightened and elated moments .\u2008.\u2008. because it comes closer than any other art form to addressing what cannot be said. In expressing the inexpressible, poetry remains close to the origins of language.\u201dWhy poetry? I sent out a few emails to see what various people had to say. The poet Louise Gl\u00fcck, on the subject of book sales, wrote back, \u201cThe books may not sell, but neither are they given away or thrown away. They tend, more than other books, to fall apart in their owners\u2019 hands. Not I suppose good news in a culture and economy built on obsolescence. But for a book to be loved this way and turned to this way for consolation and intense renewable excitement seems to me a marvel.\u201dThe Greek poet Yiannis Ritsos, jailed for political reasons, wrote his poems on cigarette papers while in prison, stuffed them into the lining of his jacket and, when he was released, walked out wearing his collected poems. They were mostly short.The Ukrainian poet Irina Ratushinskaya, while in prison, wrote her poems on bars of soap. When she had them memorized, she washed them away.The novelist Richard Ford differed from the poets in his take: \u201cThe question \u2018Why poetry?\u2019 isn\u2019t asking what makes poetry unique among art forms; poetry may indeed share its origins with other forms of privileged utterance. A somewhat more interesting question would be: \u201cWhat is the nature of experience, and especially the experience of using language, that calls poetic utterance into existence? What is there about experience that\u2019s unutterable?\u201d You can\u2019t generalize very usefully about poetry; you can\u2019t reduce its nature down to a kernel that underlies all its various incarnations. I guess my internal conversation suggests that if you can\u2019t successfully answer the question of \u201cWhy poetry?,\u201d can\u2019t reduce it in the way I think you can\u2019t, then maybe that\u2019s the strongest evidence that poetry\u2019s doing its job; it\u2019s creating an essential need and then satisfying it.\u201dWhen you\u2019re looking for a poem to read at a memorial service, what is it you\u2019re looking for? And why are you looking for a poem? Do you imagine that it is in poetry that you\u2019ll find something you could not have said yourself? And when you find the right poem, what have you discovered? What do you hear? What\u2019s been said? And what do you imagine the mourners are going to hear?Again, why poetry? I wrote the poet Robert Hass. His response: \u201c\u200a\u2018Paradise Lost\u2019 was printed in an edition of no more than 1,500 copies and transformed the English language. Took a while. Wordsworth had new ideas about nature: Thoreau read Wordsworth, Muir read Thoreau, Teddy Roosevelt read Muir, and we got a lot of national parks. Took a century. What poetry gives us is an archive, the fullest existent archive of what human beings have thought and felt by the kind of artists who loved language in a way that allowed them to labor over how you make a music of words to render experience exactly and fully.\u201dSo to the question at hand: Why support poetry? Those of us who engage in the publication and sustenance of the written word do so to insure that language for our future generations remains intact, powerful and ultimately renewed, capable of its role during times of crisis and celebration.Wallace Stevens wrote that the poet\u2019s function was \u201cto help people live their lives.\u201d And because he was a financial guy as well as a poet, he wrote, \u201cMoney is a kind of poetry.\u201d I\u2019d reverse that and say poetry is a kind of currency. As Stevens himself put it, \u201cThe imagination is man\u2019s power over nature.\u201dDaniel Halpern is a poet and the president and publisher of Ecco.Advertisement"}

When he was elected mayor of this small town in Provence eight months ago, the first thing he did was to take down the European Union flag from City Hall.\u201cIn 2005, a majority voted against Europe, and we still find ourselves in Europe, by magic,\u201d he said, \u201cand I find it inadmissible.\u201dToday the European Union is wobbling under the weight of problems encouraged in part by that unchecked expansion \u2014 stagnant economies, the euro crisis, new pressures from Russia and deep strains over migration, especially from newer members in Central and Eastern Europe.But a visit to Le Luc and other villages in southern France is a reminder that the European Union faces yet another serious problem long in the making \u2014 a crisis of legitimacy \u2014 that is fueling right-wing, nationalist politics even in the traditional core of the bloc.For Mr. Verrelle, 2005 was a watershed. Since then, opposition to a much-enlarged, poorer and vastly more diverse European Union has only increased. So has support for the National Front and its leader, Marine Le Pen, who has emerged as a serious contender in France\u2019s presidential race.Having already suffered a \u201cBrexit\u201d vote this year in Britain, Europe faces a series of critical elections in the year ahead. But none is more important than the vote in France, a founding European Union member.The British decision to quit the European Union was a major blow, but a victory by Ms. Le Pen could be the death knell. And with the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States, that prospect has taken on new weight.\u201cDonald Trump makes Marine Le Pen sound reasonable,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a special adviser to the Foundation for Strategic Research in France and chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cHis victory gives her respectability. Everyone knows she\u2019s not Trump \u2014 she knows how to use a noun and a verb and is intellectually coherent about what she wants and doesn\u2019t want.\u201dWhat Ms. Le Pen wants is to lead France out of the euro currency and out of the bloc. She has said she would hold a popular referendum, \u00e0 la Britain, on French membership in the European Union \u2014 a test of public will that mainstream French politicians, she says, are afraid to have.From the mood here in southern France, a \u201cFrexit\u201d push would probably prevail in a referendum, just as 55 percent voted in 2005 against the Constitution that a former French president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, had drafted.The French \u201cnon\u201d killed the treaty, intended to create new federal institutions for a bloc enlarged the year before by 10 countries, mostly former Soviet-bloc countries like Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.\u201cIn a way, Frexit already happened,\u201d said a prominent regional Socialist member of Parliament, Jean-David Ciot. \u201cEurope did not keep its promises, to create a world of wealth and full employment.\u201d\u201cPeople feel peace has been attained but fear that the rest of the world has come to undermine this wealth,\u201d Mr. Ciot added. \u201cThey fear Europe is not protecting them from these migrants who come to pillage and steal their wealth.\u201dBrexit, he said, is \u201cjust a symptom of the rest \u2014 the feeling that we no longer share a common destiny.\u201dSince 2005, said Mr. Verrelle, southern France has been shifting steadily toward the National Front and its opposition to the European Union. In the last three elections, he said, \u201csupport has been growing systematically.\u201dThe former prison director is scathing about the radicalization of young French Muslims and the dangers he says he believes that uncontrolled immigration poses to France.\u201cWhen I saw the prayers in the corridors of the prison, and others hiding their crosses, I knew we were lost,\u201d Mr. Verrelle said. \u201cWhat\u2019s most dangerous about Europe is the loss of borders, and today we see the result,\u201d he added, speaking of terrorist attacks and migrant flows.\u201cI\u2019m worried about Daesh,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing in a Trojan horse times 1,000.\u201dAs for the European Union, it has no clear political direction, Mr. Verrelle said, adding that it is too diverse economically for a single currency and too weak to allow freedom of travel.\u201cWe\u2019re in Europe against our will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a prison. It\u2019s not a solution that will last.\u201dAbout 90 minutes away, in La Tour d\u2019Aigues, overlooked by the ruins of a Renaissance castle demolished during the French Revolution, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front organized a protest against plans to bring about 30 teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan to the nearby town of Grambois.The protesters, fewer than 200, were met by about 300 counterdemonstrators holding up banners showing solidarity with the refugees, while 90 riot police officers, dressed in black protective clothing, ringed the two groups to keep them apart.Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, a niece of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s and a rising star of the National Front, addressed the crowd from a makeshift podium, tossing her blond hair behind her.\u201cIt is not the hate of others, it is love for Provence, love for France,\u201d Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, 27, shouted into the microphone, as counterprotesters whistled and booed to try to drown her out. She railed against a \u201cdictatorial\u201d European Commission that \u201cworks to undermine national sovereignty.\u201dAsylum seekers coming to France receive generous payouts, she said, while the Vaucluse region, the home of La Tour d\u2019Aigues, is the sixth poorest in France, where one in five people are without jobs.\u201cWe are against this completely crazy plan to redistribute migrants,\u201d Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen said in a brief interview after her speech. The European project \u201cis a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to build another Europe.\u201dThe wave of anger and identity politics is washing over France, with the ready-made instrument of a modernized National Front under Ms. Le Pen, 48.She has now become both a symbol and an agent of a kind of defensive French nationalism that is proving very popular, especially in the southeast and north, near the Belgian border.As the European Union struggles with fundamental issues of coherence, policy and solidarity, she has also become a plausible, if unlikely, president of France \u2014 almost sure to make the two-candidate runoff for the post in May.Brussels is an easy target, especially for politicians like her seeking to blame domestic ills on some supranational agency.\u201cThere is huge disappointment with Europe,\u201d said Sylvie Goulard, a French member of the European Parliament for this region. \u201cBut a tendency to blame Europe for national competencies \u2014 hospitals and nurses, malaise of the police, housing \u2014 these are all Franco-French failures, nothing to do with Europe.\u201dThe mood is worse in the south, Ms. Goulard said. \u201cI\u2019m from the south, and people are angry and frustrated,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you realize that lack of transportation or the failure to integrate foreigners are not the fault of Europe, but Le Pen is exploiting these issues.\u201dBut even Ms. Goulard, who has announced her candidacy to become speaker of the European Parliament, acknowledges Brussels\u2019s many failures. It has not created functioning external borders, and its response to the migrant issue has caused severe strains among member countries and undermined solidarity.\u201cIt would be stupid to be too optimistic,\u201d Ms. Goulard said. \u201cBut we have tried to do something never done on earth, to get so many people to live and trade together in peace.\u201dThere are some strong proponents of Europe, too.Alain-Pierre Merger, president of the Maison de l\u2019Europe de Provence, the regional chapter of an association that supports the European Union and promotes European citizenship, said that it would be a tragedy to break up the union, and that young people now feel a European identity that must be strengthened. \u201cEurope is an idea, but it must be seen to be working,\u201d he said.One of the members of the chapter, Caroline Brun, 23, said: \u201cThis has been a tough year for our hopes.\u201dMany blame Europe for the migrants, she said, adding: \u201cBut it\u2019s not Europe. It\u2019s the fault of the politicians of European states who use Europe as a scapegoat.\u201dAt La Tour d\u2019Aigues, even the town\u2019s Socialist mayor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lovisolo, expressed disenchantment. Europe has \u201cfailed to fight for a European identity,\u201d he said.The monetary and economic union that underpins Europe did not translate into a closer political and social union, he said, \u201cand Europe is not working.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s supporters could not agree more. \u00c9douard, a former colonel who served in Kosovo who declined to give his surname, said at the rally that \u201cwe have not seen the benefits\u201d of Europe.\u201cMy generation was told, \u2018You are European,\u2019 and there was great hope and excitement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that translated into a recession. It has been a terrible disappointment.\u201dAn article on Dec. 18 about the European Union\u2019s crisis of legitimacy, which is fueling right-wing, nationalist politics, misidentified an area of France where the right-wing National Front party is popular. It is southeast France, not southwest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DST Global Leads $80 Million Private Investment in Nubank", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byNew backers Redpoint and Ribbit Capital, which over the last six years have been two of Silicon Valley\u2019s most active investors in Brazil, also participated. Mr. Velez did not disclose the private company\u2019s current valuation.The investment comes at a time when the broader financial technology sector in Brazil is gaining traction.Last week, the online trading platform XP Investimentos, backed by the private equity firm General Atlantic, said it had acquired Rico, another online investment platform. It paid approximately 400 million reais, or $116.7 million, according to Isaias Sznifer, a principal at Greenhill & Company in Brazil, the firm that advised Rico\u2019s founding shareholders on the deal.\u201cWe think there\u2019s a lot of interest, both from local and international players in the space, and we expect to see a number of transactions in the full spectrum of fintech in the coming 12 to 24 months,\u201d said Mr. Sznifer, a former Goldman Sachs vice president.Nubank provides a digital credit card for smartphones. It is looking to take customers away from Brazil\u2019s highly profitable banks.The start-up, based in S\u00e3o Paulo, was founded in 2013, and it rolled out its credit card in 2014.Brazil has some of the highest interest rates among emerging economies even after the country\u2019s central bank has recently begun to lower its benchmark Selic rate for the first time since 2012.The average annual interest rate for credit cards as of October was 119.7 percent, up from 97.5 percent in October 2015, according to data from Brazil\u2019s Central Bank.Nubank\u2019s monthly interest rate ranges from 2.75 percent to 14 percent, depending on a customer\u2019s credit history. Even that upper rate is lower than the average rates offered by Brazil\u2019s largest banks, according to the most recent weekly central bank data.Mr. Velez, a former Sequoia Capital partner, said the new financing was \u201ca bit more of growth capital to expand our customer base.\u201dHe said the company, which now has 392 employees, has received more than seven million applications for its card and has more than half a million people on a wait list.\u201cTo sustain our growth, we need to put the capital into systems, infrastructure, in people, and make sure we maintain really good customer service and great technology and infrastructure,\u201d he added.Nubank also faces growing competition from Brazil\u2019s traditional banks. Santander Brasil recently introduced a competing product, as did Banco CBSS, which is a joint venture between Banco Bradesco and Banco do Brasil. Bradesco has other digital initiatives as well, and Banco Itau is growing in that space.The president of Itau, Roberto Setubal, said at an event this year that fintech companies \u201crepresent a challenge and an opportunity\u201d for his and the other large banks. Last year, Itau together with Redpoint started Cubo, a co-working space for start-ups in S\u00e3o Paulo.Still, Nubank has momentum. One sign of its appeal is that it has lured multiple prominent foreign investors to make their debut investments in Brazil. The company was Sequoia Capital\u2019s first investment here.Similarly, Founders Fund\u2019s first investment in Brazil was in Nubank one year ago, even though Mr. Thiel had invested in the country through his other investment funds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Pruitt Will Make America Gasp Again", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byMuch of the commentary on the Pruitt appointment has focused on his denial of climate science and on the high likelihood that the incoming administration will undo the substantial progress President Obama was beginning to make against climate change. And that is, in the long run, the big story.After all, climate change is an existential threat in a way local pollution isn\u2019t, and the installation of the Trump team in power may mean that we have lost our last, best chance for a cooperative international effort to contain that threat.Everyone who contributed to this outcome \u2014 very much, if I may say, including the journalists who elevated the fundamentally trivial issue of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails into the dominant theme of campaign reporting \u2014 bears part of the responsibility for what may end up being a civilization-ending event. No, that\u2019s not hyperbole.But climate change is a slow-building, largely invisible threat, hard to explain or demonstrate to the general public \u2014 which is one reason lavishly funded climate deniers have been so successful at obfuscating the issue. So it\u2019s worth pointing out that most environmental regulation involves much more obvious, immediate, sometimes deadly threats. And much of that regulation may well be headed for oblivion.Think about what America was like in 1970, the year the E.P.A. was founded. It was still an industrial nation, with roughly a quarter of the work force employed in manufacturing, often at relatively high wages, in large part because of a still-strong union movement. (Funny how Trumpist pledges to bring back the good old days never mention that part.)It\u2019s far better now \u2014 not perfect, but much better. These days, to experience the kind of pollution crisis that used to be all too frequent in Los Angeles or Houston, you have to go to places like Beijing or New Delhi. And the improvement in air quality has had clear, measurable benefits. For example, we\u2019re seeing significant improvements in lung function among children in the Los Angeles area, clearly tied to reduced pollution.The key point is that better air didn\u2019t happen by accident: It was a direct result of regulation \u2014 regulation that was bitterly opposed at every step by special interests that attacked the scientific evidence of harm from pollution, meanwhile insisting that limiting their emissions would kill jobs.These special interests were, as you might guess, wrong about everything. The health benefits of cleaner air are overwhelmingly clear. Meanwhile, experience shows that a growing economy is perfectly consistent with an improving environment. In fact, reducing pollution brings large economic benefits once you take into account health care costs and the effects of lower pollution on productivity.So the looming degradation of environmental protection will be a bad thing on every level: bad for the economy as well as bad for our health. But don\u2019t expect rational arguments to that effect to sway the people who will soon be running the government. After all, what\u2019s bad for America can still be good for the likes of the Koch brothers. Besides, my correspondents keep telling me that arguing policy on the basis of facts and figures is arrogant and elitist, so there.The good news, sort of, is that some of the nasty environmental consequences of Trumpism will probably be visible \u2014 literally \u2014 quite soon. And when bad air days make a comeback, we\u2019ll know exactly whom to blame.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Restless Quest for a Good Night\u2019s Sleep", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byIf you are reading this at 3 a.m., chances are that James Proud wants to put you in a deep slumber.As the inventor of the sleep-tracking device Sense, Mr. Proud has enjoyed heady success in the quickly growing sleep tech field: Sense\u2019s 2014 Kickstarter campaign raised about $2.4 million even though the goal was only $100,000.\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by helping people live better,\u201d said Mr. Proud, 25, a British citizen who came to the United States via the Thiel Fellowship, which gives entrepreneurs $100,000 for skipping college. \u201cAnd sleep is the foundation of everything. So it\u2019s the best place to start.\u201dInsomnia and other temporary and recurring sleep disorders affect 50 million to 70 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health, and the effects only worsen as people grow older. Technology, while still nascent, is an alternative for those who do not want to take sleeping pills, which can be highly addictive.Like many other tech devices that monitor every twitch and turn of the human body, Sense uses sensors to collect reams of data. The information is then uploaded to a smartphone app that analyzes sleep cycles. An accelerometer about the size of a quarter attaches to a pillow and tracks tosses and turns. And a bedside hub, shaped like a ball, tracks sounds, light and temperature in a room. It glows green when sleep conditions are optimal.\u201cYou can fall into bed drunk and it still works,\u201d said Mr. Proud, a self-taught programmer.All are trying to solve an age-old problem with new technologies that experts say are still mostly unproven.Yet, experts agree that the market is huge and important. About half the United States population will have insomnia on any given night, Dr. Kline said.\u201cA huge slice of society would be interested in this technology,\u201d Dr. Kline said.The company invented a system that tracks time awake, breathing rate and number of tosses and turns through a mattress cover embedded with sensors. An app then \u201cgrades\u201d users\u2019 sleep, allowing them to adjust their sleeping habits.\u201cWe provide insight to users,\u201d said Mr. Franceschetti, a serial entrepreneur who started two clean-tech companies in the last several years. \u201cIt\u2019s partly education.\u201dEight, based in New York, now has 17 employees. It has raised $6.5 million so far from Y Combinator, Comcast Ventures, Azure Capital Partners and others.\u201cEveryone knows about nutrition and fitness,\u201d said Paul Ferris, general partner at Azure Capital Partners. \u201cSleep is the third pillar.\u201dThe rapid rise of wearable fitness trackers like Fitbit, he added, helped set up a fire hose of data that consumers could harness to track behavior.Early adopters like Alex Muir, a tech support analyst who works at a New York private school, are helping test these early sleep technologies. Last year, he contributed $199 to Eight\u2019s Indiegogo campaign, and got the company\u2019s smart cover, hub and app.\u201cEight is helping me identify what\u2019s going on with my sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s colder, I get a better night\u2019s sleep, and I can see that in the app.\u201dMr. Muir acknowledges that technology alone can\u2019t solve problems with sleep. \u201cIt can provide a baseline of information, though,\u201d he said.Some who study sleep, however, say sensors and technology do not necessarily solve the underlying problems of insomnia.\u201cSleep sensors are feeding back inaccurate information,\u201d said Hawley Montgomery-Downs, a sleep expert and an associate professor of psychology at West Virginia University. \u201cThey\u2019re telling people they sleep better than they do.\u201dAdditionally, she said, no federal regulations or standards govern the sleep tech niche.\u201cThe industry is screaming for grown-ups to come along,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sleep is sexy and lucrative. So people need to ask questions about empirical evidence for these apps.\u201dExperts add that sleep apps also collect lots of data that is not then interpreted. \u201cThe devices can show you when you\u2019re awake,\u201d Dr. Kline said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t tell you why. So the technology can\u2019t help consumers fix all their sleep problems.\u201dIn the sleep field, wearables may be the toughest sell. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to wear wearables at night because most people take technology off,\u201d said Mr. Proud, who also tried out his product, Sense, as a wearable. \u201cSilicon Valley is arrogant and gets it wrong sometimes.\u201dBarak Kassar\u2019s experience with a wearable is a case in point. When worn at night, it gathered sleep data and sent it to an app.But Mr. Kassar quickly found out that the data collected wasn\u2019t useful. He learned \u201cthat I wake up in the middle of the night, which showed up on the graph on my phone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I already knew that.\u201d Now he wears the modernistic-looking device as jewelry.However, recent research does show that online cognitive behavior therapies can help restore sleep. After Peter Hames developed insomnia, his doctor in England prescribed sleeping pills.\u201cDrugs have had a monopoly on evidence-based health care,\u201d Mr. Hames said. Instead, he turned to a course in cognitive behavior therapy developed by an expert, which cured him in six weeks.So far, the company has raised $15 million from backers like Kaiser Permanente Ventures and Octopus Ventures, based in London. It has a 25-person team, including three clinical researchers. Clients include big employers like LinkedIn and Comcast, which pay for a year\u2019s access.\u201cWe synthesize the world\u2019s best experts,\u201d he said. \u201cOther apps have been toys, not true medicine.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Leader, Loyal to a Fault", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byWithin minutes, the news had inundated local media, and the political opposition \u2014 which won nearly 55 percent of the open seats in recent legislative elections \u2014 was cheering. Even a good part of the pro-government camp seemed to give a collective sigh of relief.Simply put, Mr. Leung has fallen out of favor because he went too far. His efforts to interpret to Beijing\u2019s advantage the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle, the crux of Hong Kong\u2019s relations with China, have only spurred a separatist movement and alienated even some mainstream or politically neutral Hong Kongers: They now see him as too ready to shortchange the rule of the law here in order to please the Chinese government.Mr. Leung has become too unpopular in Hong Kong to be useful to Beijing \u2014 for, yes, public opinion matters to the Chinese government, and so does preserving Hong Kong\u2019s special freedoms, which serve China\u2019s interests.Why? And why is Mr. Leung allowed to serve out his term, when Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong\u2019s feckless and hapless first chief executive after Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, was made to resign unceremoniously midterm, after mass protests, invoking leg pain? Letting go of Mr. Tung early had allowed Donald Tsang, the chief secretary and second\u2013ranking official in the city, to step in as acting chief executive well ahead of the next election, giving him time to become a shoo-in. The current chief secretary, Carrie Lam, apparently is being allowed no such advantage.Since Ms. Lam is a hard-liner much in Mr. Leung\u2019s mold, Beijing may be signaling that it thinks their approach has failed and that change is in order. Perhaps taking the hint, John Tsang, the popular finance minister and the standard-bearer of a softer political line, has just resigned, suggesting an upcoming candidacy.But Mr. Leung himself is seen as having set a spark to the firewood of separatism, after having laid that out, unwittingly. He has called for \u201cfusing\u201d the two systems of the city and the mainland (\u4e2d\u6e2f\u878d\u5408) and \u201cunifying\u201d Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a major city right across the border (\u6df1\u6e2f\u540c\u57ce\u5316) \u2014 in other words, chipping away at Hong Kong\u2019s distinctiveness. In what may have been a warning, President Xi Jinping of China last year acknowledged \u201cnew developments in Hong Kong,\u201d but cautioned that, \u201cone must see to it that there be no deformation, no change in shape, in \u2018one country, two systems.\u2019 \u201dMany people here, including the politically neutral, object to such measures. When they don\u2019t want more autonomy for Hong Kong, they want the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle applied as it was originally conceived in the 1980s \u2014 not Mr. Leung\u2019s version. By going against the wishes of the majority and triggering a powerful backlash, Mr. Leung has committed, in the parlance of Chinese communism, the sin of ultra-leftism. Even his extraordinary efforts to remove the separatists from the local legislature could not redeem him and his associates in the eyes of Beijing.The leadership in China cannot abide the idea of independence for Hong Kong; Mr. Leung was correct about that. But neither does Beijing want Hong Kong to become more like China, and he failed to understand that. Hong Kong is far more useful to the Chinese government as it is today than if it became a glorified version of Shenzhen or Shanghai.Hong Kong\u2019s special legal status has allowed it to develop a sound regulatory framework, top-notch courts, a truly cosmopolitan professional class and a remarkably stable financial market. It remains a leading financial center, and Beijing needs the world to see China through that window. This is especially the case these days, now that Beijing\u2019s efforts to turn the renminbi into a fully convertible international currency are stalling and the U.S. government and other Western states have refused to formally recognize China as a market economy. In the end, Mr. Leung was done in by his failure to appreciate one simple thing: China still needs Hong Kong more than Hong Kong needs it.Yi-Zheng Lian is a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hyundai\u2019s U.S. Chief Is Out, as Automaker Seeks to Rekindle Growth", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byJust four months ago, Hyundai Motor was celebrating a key achievement \u2014 the introduction of a new line of luxury cars sold under the name Genesis.Supported by a multimillion-dollar National Football League promotional campaign, Genesis had been an ambitious bid to join the likes of Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the highest echelon of the auto industry. And it was meant to rekindle growth for once-hot Hyundai, which has cooled considerably in recent years.But it has been a bumpy ride for the Genesis brand in the United States, and on Wednesday the South Korean company unexpectedly replaced its top American executive, David Zuchowski.W. Gerald Flannery, the American unit\u2019s general counsel, was named interim president and chief executive.The company did not elaborate on the reason for the change, saying only that Mr. Flannery would focus on \u201cenhancing the company\u2019s brands, accelerating change for growth and customer satisfaction.\u201dThe challenges that Hyundai faces are well known. Sales growth has been sluggish the last few years. In the first 11 months of this year, Hyundai\u2019s sales grew by only 1.3 percent, to 707,485 cars and light trucks, from the comparable period in 2015.In contrast, a corporate cousin, Kia Motor, an affiliate controlled by the Hyundai group, has seen sales rise by 3.8 percent, to 593,245 vehicles.Although Mr. Zuchowski was in many ways executing a strategy devised at headquarters in Seoul, the company has a history of abruptly dismissing American executives when business falters.A big part of Hyundai\u2019s problem is that the Genesis arrived at the wrong time, when Americans are flocking to sport-utility vehicles. While gasoline remains cheap, they are turning from small and midsize cars \u2014 Hyundai\u2019s previous strength.Last month, amid signs the Genesis was underwhelming the market, Mr. Zuchowski used the Los Angeles Auto Show to revamp their line of S.U.V.s. He promised that Hyundai would increase the size of two current models, the Santa Fe and Tucson, and add to its lineup a small crossover \u2014 a lightweight, fuel-efficient S.U.V.\u201cThe market is not interested in sedans,\u201d said Matt DeLorenzo, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book, a research firm. \u201cGenesis needs a much wider product range, and it needs S.U.V.s, before it can be a success.\u201dThe Genesis line now offers two model, both sedans: the G80, with a starting price of about $40,000, and the larger and more luxurious G90, priced from about $68,000.Since August, Hyundai dealers in the United States have sold 5,215 Genesis cars \u2014 far fewer than the competing models from Lexus, Mercedes and BMW.Even Scott Fink, a member of Hyundai\u2019s American dealer council advisory board, had trouble expressing much enthusiasm for the Genesis.\u201cSo far it\u2019s going O.K.,\u201d said Mr. Fink, owner of a Hyundai franchise in New Port Richey, Fla. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting going, and it\u2019s going to take time.\u201dIt has not helped that the G90 has been in short supply.Previously, Hyundai offered luxury models called the Genesis and the Equus. About 350 dealers continue to sell those vehicles, but the new brand may be limited to around 250 dealers.Some dealers wanted to sign up to represent the new Genesis brand, but the cost for new signs and other modifications to their dealerships, at upward of $100,000 or more, was unappealing.\u201cIn the end, for the brand to be successful, we can\u2019t have as many dealers as we have today,\u201d Mr. Fink said.The Genesis G80 and G90 are imported from Korea, which is a factor in the shortage of G90s. About 40 percent of the vehicles Hyundai sells in the United States are made in the United States. It operates a plant in Montgomery, Ala., and also assembles some models at a Kia plant in West Point, Ga.Hyundai is the most recent automaker to run into difficulties while trying to introduce a new luxury brand. While Toyota has had great success since it added Lexus more than 20 years ago, neither Honda nor Nissan has done as well with their premium marques, Acura and Infiniti.Mr. DeLorenzo said it would be hard to attract luxury buyers as long as Genesis cars were selling in the same locations as the lower-priced Hyundai models.Hyundai enjoyed rapid growth in the United States from 2008 through 2013, helped by its Sonata sedan, which the company had redesigned with a curvaceous look. It also priced competitively against the giants of midsize cars, the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord, and included side airbags and an electronic stability control system.Hyundai had similar success with a smaller car, the Elantra, and soon Hyundai was seen as a serious competitor to Toyota, Honda, Ford Motor and General Motors.Mr. Fink, the Florida dealer, said he was happy with the job Mr. Zuchowski was doing. \u201cDave was a great leader,\u201d he said.Mr. Zuchowski joined Hyundai in 2007 as a top sales executive. He had previously worked at Mazda Motors and Ford.\u201cWe appreciate Dave\u2019s decade of service to Hyundai, especially his leadership as president and C.E.O., which has made us a stronger organization,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.An earlier version of this article misstated a 2012 finding by United States regulators about fuel-economy claims by Hyundai and Kia. The government found that the automakers had been overstating fuel economy numbers on about a third of their models, not that they had overstated the figures by as much as a third.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama Is Handing a Strong Economy to His Successor", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byDeparting occupants of the White House rarely hand off an improving economy to a successor from the opposing party.When Barack Obama was waiting in the wings after the 2008 presidential election, for example, the economy was in a severe downward spiral: Employers reported cutting 533,000 jobs that November, the biggest monthly loss in a generation.The Federal Reserve is confident enough about the economy\u2019s underlying strength that it is now set to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets later this month.The jobless rate for November, the lowest since August 2007, \u201cis a testimony to how strong employment growth has been,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.\u201cIt was an utterly terrifying time, the likes of which none of us had ever seen in our lifetimes,\u201d Mr. Furman recalled. Fearing that \u201cthe economy was following the same trajectory that it did at the beginning of the Great Depression,\u201d everyone was focused on how to \u201crapidly slow the bleeding and figure out how to get the economy growing again.\u201dBy contrast, Mr. Furman said, \u201cthe economy today is healthy and it\u2019s improving.\u201dProfound anxiety, particularly among the white working class, about the ability to reach or comfortably remain in the middle class is one of the factors that helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House.Pockets of weakness also surfaced in the latest jobs report, which showed that more people dropped out of the labor force last month than joined it. Manufacturing jobs declined further, and there are still plenty of part-time workers who would rather be full time. And while the official jobless rate for high school graduates fell to 4.9 percent, it is more than twice the rate for college graduates.For others, the prospects do not look good. \u201cThere used to be part of the work force that had well-paying jobs that were low or unskilled,\u201d Mr. Prising said. \u201cThose kinds of jobs are very difficult to find today.\u201dThe deal that Mr. Trump made with the heating and cooling company Carrier this week to keep 1,000 manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico from Indiana is emblematic of the kind of actions he said he would take as president to help blue-collar workers.But there are limits to the power of persuasion.Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former economic adviser to Mr. Obama, said that manufacturing, while still a driving force in the economy, employed fewer and fewer people. More than 80 percent of jobs are now in the service industry, Ms. Stevenson said, and Mr. Trump should be thinking more about how to match workers with those jobs.\u201cThe economy is in a great place, and his biggest challenge is continuing that,\u201d she said.Such pleas are unlikely to win the day. At last month\u2019s meeting of the Federal Reserve, members concluded that the case for an increase in the benchmark rate had been \u201cstrengthened,\u201d and that they would be ready to move \u201cso long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress.\u201dFederal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.Many employers are having a harder time finding and retaining workers.\u201cRecruiting is a tough issue right now in skilled and semiskilled industries,\u201d said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City. He mentioned a particular need for workers in accounting, information technology, call centers, warehousing and office and professional services.\u201cThe challenge out there now is finding workers and keeping the workers you have,\u201d said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. Those shortages, whatever the cause, are likely to push wages higher next year, he said.\u201cPeople are feeling good not only about their current income but their future income,\u201d Mr. Rick said.\u201cTrump can be thankful that his predecessor is handing him a fairly strong situation,\u201d Mr. Rozell said, \u201cespecially when compared to many past party transfers of power.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Center-Left Party Poised to Regain Power in Romania", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Romanian voters appeared to return the center-left Social Democratic Party to power in parliamentary elections on Sunday, a year after large protests in Bucharest over a deadly nightclub fire led to the resignation of the party\u2019s previous government.With more than 90 percent of the vote counted, the Social Democratic Party led with just over 46 percent. Its main rival, the National Liberal Party, trailed by more than 25 percentage points.If that lead bears out, the Social Democratic Party will be in a position to lead the country in a coalition with the smaller Alliance of Liberals and Democrats party, which appeared to have just over 5 percent of the vote.\u201cToday, citizens voted for economic growth, for jobs, for more money into the pockets of Romanians,\u201d Liviu Dragnea, the Social Democratic Party leader, said in a statement after exit polls pointed to a victory for the party.During the campaign, party leaders promised significant government spending \u2014 including increased salaries and pensions, investments in infrastructure and health care \u2014 and tax cuts. Romania has the fastest-growing economy in the European Union, but wages remain low, which has sent many Romanians seeking work abroad.Voter turnout on Sunday was less than 40 percent. Years of political scandals, including high-level corruption convictions, have left the electorate disillusioned.Even with the result strongly favoring the Social Democratic Party, concerns about corruption created uncertainty about who would be prime minister in the new government.The party\u2019s previous prime minister, Victor Ponta, is being investigated on accusations of forgery, money laundering and being an accessory to tax evasion. Mr. Dragnea, the party\u2019s leader, was given a two-year suspended sentence for electoral fraud in April 2016 and earlier ruled himself out of the running. So, too, did the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats\u2019 joint leader, Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, who was prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and was charged with perjury in July. He has denied the accusations.The country\u2019s president, Klaus Iohannis, is pushing for a prime minister clear of criminal convictions and active investigations.Romania has been governed for the last year by a cabinet of technocrats, with Sunday\u2019s election a chance for the main political parties to reassert themselves.The result was not wholly unexpected; polls had predicted a strong showing for the Social Democratic Party. But some had thought that the party\u2019s main rival, the National Liberal Party, might have enough support to win a majority in coalition with a new party, the Union to Save Romania. That party campaigned on a platform of greater governmental accountability and transparency.Both of those parties had supported keeping Dacian Ciolos, a technocrat in office since November 2015, as prime minister.Now, some analysts see Vasile Dancu, a deputy prime minister, as the best bet to become prime minister, said Radu Delicote, a strategist at the political consulting group Smartlink Communications.\u201cDancu is Western oriented and bourgeoisie in a good way, but he will need a strong team in place to get things done,\u201d Mr. Delicote said, adding that negotiations between the parties over ministries mean that a full cabinet will not be in place until the new year.Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj, said Mr. Dragnea might still be an option, despite his legal troubles: He might try to get himself appointed, or if that fails, choose a close ally as prime minister. The former ministers Rovana Plumb and Bogdan Teodorovici are among the most probable candidates, Mr. Miscoiu said.Unlike other votes that have taken place in Europe in 2016, Romania\u2019s position in the European Union did not figure prominently in this campaign.\u201cPeople in Romania like Brussels and the European Union,\u201d Mr. Delicote said. \u201cIn the next few years, the main theme in Romania is going to be the economy, not nationalism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ukrainian Farmers, Poised for Growth, Stumble After E.U. Deal", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosSADKI-STROYEVKA, Ukraine \u2014 A cold wind whips through the streets. Vehicles that enter must drive through a foot-deep, moatlike bath of disinfectant, lest their tires track in disease. Computers raise and lower the levels of light to match circadian rhythms.The scene is one of emptiness. One in four buildings is deserted. Fewer delivery trucks arrive than in years past.As in much of Ukraine, hard times have befallen the Slovyany farm and its million or so inhabitants \u2014 all of them chickens.\u201cWe could be a player, and not a small one,\u201d said a forlorn Oleg Bakhmatyuk, the owner of Avangard, Ukraine\u2019s biggest egg producer. \u201cWe could be a major supplier.\u201dThe plight of his company, and the broader agricultural sector, has come to encapsulate a wider disenchantment in Ukraine with a trade agreement signed two years ago with the European Union. The deal, which went into force in January, included protections for farmers in the European bloc, and, as a result, one of Ukraine\u2019s most successful industries has been effectively shut out of the new opportunities.For a blend of economic and political reasons, Ukraine built a singular capitalist achievement after the fall of Communism: enormous, technologically advanced chicken farms that are among the largest in the world.At its peak, Avangard had space nationwide for 30 million laying hens. Thanks to cheap grain and low labor costs, it is able to produce billions of eggs annually at a low price. The wholesale price of an egg in Ukraine is 4 cents, compared with 25 cents in Poland and 35 cents in Germany.Here in the hardscrabble farming town of Sadki-Stroyevka, birds far outnumber people. Each henhouse houses around 100,000 clucking, pecking, egg-laying birds. Cages stretch for as far as the eye can see. The buildings, which reek of disinfectant and manure, form extraordinarily efficient egg-producing machines.Feed flows in on one set of belts, eggs out on another. The light brightens and dims automatically to maximize the birds\u2019 biological clocks. So many eggs tumble along the main collector belt that it resembles a burbling, brown brook.The opportunities were so plentiful that Mr. Bakhmatyuk, colorfully nicknamed Ukraine\u2019s Egg King, plowed a fortune made as an executive in a natural gas company into farming.By 2013, Avangard had been listed on the London Stock Exchange, and it was still adding capacity. Its prospects looked good.The same year, Ukraine\u2019s president at the time rejected a trade pact with the European Union, choosing a deal with Russia instead. Pro-European citizens took to the streets in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev, in protests that led to a revolution.In 2014, the country\u2019s new government pivoted back to the European deal, signing what was known as the Association Agreement. The pact held great promise for this country of about 42 million people, and Europe\u2019s political leaders encouraged Kiev\u2019s pivot to the West.The agriculture industry was, however, given short shrift. The sector is often a sensitive topic during trade negotiations. Not only is it typically a major employer that countries view as strategically important, but it is also sensitive to price, fueling fears of cheap food flooding the market.The sector accounts for about 40 percent of Ukraine\u2019s exports. But tariff-free quotas for most agricultural products, under the trade deal, are tiny. Allocations for honey, for example, were so low that they were filled in the first six weeks of the year. Quotas to export eggs to the Europe Union equate to around 1.5 percent of just Avangard\u2019s annual output, let alone that of the entire sector.\u201cEurope could have done so much more in opening its borders,\u201d said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics. \u201cUkrainians associate the move to the European Union with values, like the fight against corruption.\u201dBut, Mr. Mylovanov said, if the deal does not also lift the economy, \u201cthe agreement will have limited support.\u201dThe deal itself was not particularly favorable to the agriculture sector, but there were other consequences as well. When the agreement was signed in March 2014, it almost immediately triggered conflict with Russia, Ukraine\u2019s powerful neighbor. Moscow annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists took control of parts of eastern Ukraine.Avangard lost seven farms and 7.5 million chickens. It now keeps just 10.7 million hens, barely a third of its prewar capacity.In effect, the deal provided a double blow to the agriculture sector: It went far enough to enrage Russia, but stopped short of immediately opening a lucrative new market.As if to compound Avangard\u2019s problems, unrest in the Middle East also hit the company\u2019s bottom line.Iraq was one of the company\u2019s major customers, buying 800 million eggs from Kiev producers as recently as 2013 \u2014 equivalent to around 15 percent of Avangard\u2019s total output. But then Islamic State militants took control of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, and much of the rest of the country, in the summer of 2014. After that, sales to the embattled country fell off drastically.Problems are piling up for Ukraine, Mr. Bakhmatyuk said.\u201cWe need capital investment and trade investment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no liquidity. We are losing our export market. As an agricultural territory, we are moving backward.\u201dThe European deal has not, however, been uniformly negative for Ukraine. Many businesses have benefited.And even Ukraine\u2019s farmers have reaped some rewards, albeit indirectly. By signing on to the pact, Ukraine has agreed to meet European Union standards for food quality. That has eased the way for exports to other markets, such as China.It is to those areas that Mr. Bakhmatyuk is now looking. Avangard has shifted its strategy to selling lower-margin egg powder, which goes into products like commercial baked goods and pasta, to China. The company expects to close deals to do so next year.But the future of the agreement is nevertheless cloudy.The election of Donald J. Trump, who has suggested patching up relations with Russia, has raised questions over American support for Ukraine. And even within Europe, support for the pact is lukewarm \u2014 two-thirds of Dutch voters urged their government in April to rescind the deal in a nonbinding referendum.Investors have been asking, \u201cWhen will you sell to Europe?\u2019\u201d said Vyacheslav B. Kotsun, the director of an Avangard farm.\u201cThey need to solve this problem fast,\u201d he added. \u201cThe quotas are miserable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Health Spending in 2015 Averaged Nearly $10,000 Per Person", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Total spending on health care in the United States increased last year at the fastest rate since the 2008 recession, reaching $3.2 trillion, or an average of nearly $10,000 a person, the Department of Health and Human Services reported on Friday.The growth coincided with continuing increases in the number of Americans with insurance coverage, through private health plans or Medicaid.Federal spending on health care has increased by 21 percent over the past two years, as millions of Americans gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the department said in its annual report on health spending.Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has been paying the full cost of Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries. Thirty-one states have chosen to expand eligibility.Over all, the government said, health spending accounted for 17.8 percent of the nation\u2019s economy in 2015, up from 17.4 percent in 2014.Total health spending rose 5.8 percent last year, and spending per person increased 5 percent. The Obama administration said this growth was \u201cbelow the rates of most years prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act.\u201dAnne B. Martin, an economist who was the principal author of the report, said the federal government became the largest source of health spending last year, accounting for 29 percent of the total \u2014 more than households, private businesses or state and local governments. That stems not only from rising coverage through the health law but also an aging population, which is expanding Medicare.The health law was always expected to fuel an increase in health spending, but the law has cost less than originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, in part because the number of people signing up for subsidized coverage through online insurance exchanges was lower than expected.Growth in total national health spending was exceptionally low for five years, from 2009 through 2013, in part because of lingering effects of the recession, officials said. The White House also asserted that the health law had slowed health spending, by cutting the growth of Medicare payments to many health care providers and by encouraging them to become more efficient.\u201cOver the last 55 years, the largest increases in health spending\u2019s share of the economy have typically occurred around periods of economic recession,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cThe 2014 and 2015 increases occurred more than five years after the last recession ended. But they coincided with 9.7 million individuals gaining private health insurance coverage and 10.3 million more people enrolling in Medicaid.\u201dRapid increases in retail spending on prescription drugs also contributed to the growth of national health spending, officials said.The report noted \u201cstrong growth in new specialty medications such as those used to treat hepatitis C, cancer, autoimmune diseases and multiple sclerosis, as well as in more traditional brand-name medications such as those used to treat diabetes.\u201dIn 2015, the report said, prices for existing brand-name drugs increased at a double-digit rate for the fourth consecutive year. An increase in the number of new drugs approved for use was also a factor.\u201cIn 2015,\u201d the government said, \u201c45 new drugs were approved, more than in any one year over the past decade.\u201dRetail sending on prescription drugs grew 9 percent last year \u2014 more than any other category of health care goods and services \u2014 and reached $324.6 billion, representing 10 percent of all health spending, the government said.Those figures understate drug spending, officials said, because they generally do not include spending on drugs administered in doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals and nursing homes.In the past two years, the report said, 20 million people either gained private health insurance coverage or enrolled in Medicaid, primarily as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The share of the population with health coverage increased to 90.9 percent in 2015, from 86 percent in 2013, before the law\u2019s major coverage provisions took effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Carrier: How a Modern Economy Is Like a Parking Garage", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byCreative DestructionIn the two hours that President-elect Donald J. Trump spent flying to Indiana on Thursday to boast that he saved 1,000 jobs, about 6,000 private-sector jobs in the United States were probably destroyed.Over a full presidential term, more than 100 million jobs will be destroyed. Mr. Trump can\u2019t expect to stanch much of that flow.Of course, not all jobs that go away are gone forever: Public beaches need lifeguards every summer, and Macy\u2019s hires elves around Christmastime. Not that this is necessarily much comfort to a jobless elf in January.One lesson here is that Mr. Trump\u2019s deal-cutting approach is wholly inadequate \u2014 and impractical \u2014 in view of the size of the American labor market. While the workers at Carrier benefited from Mr. Trump\u2019s attention, the problem is that this approach doesn\u2019t scale.The number of companies that are in a situation like Carrier\u2019s is so large that no president could hope to sift through and save any reasonable percentage of them. The number of companies that might pretend to be in distress in the hopes of getting a handout to remain is even larger.And distinguishing between the two groups is nearly impossible.But the Carrier case also illustrates a larger point about how the economy works. In Mr. Trump\u2019s telling, the economy is a fixed set of jobs getting shifted around a global chess board. Mexico\u2019s loss is our gain and vice versa.Think of the American economy as a 10-level parking structure or garage, where each car represents an active firm, and the seats in the car are the jobs available. A well-managed business like this is usually pretty full. But it\u2019s also in a state of constant flux, with new cars entering as some people arrive, and previously parked cars leaving as others head home. Every hour, around a tenth of the cars leave the lot, just as a tenth of existing business establishments close each year and leave the labor market.The deal at Carrier is akin to Mr. Trump\u2019s intercepting a driver on his way to his car, and trying to persuade him to stay parked a little longer \u2014 perhaps by pointing to the enticing Christmas specials at the nearby stores.It\u2019s an approach that no parking business bothers trying.Rather, the long-term strategy of such businesses is to try to attract a larger clientele by offering a more convenient experience. They understand that there are many more potential customers outside than inside the garage. In this analogy, the government\u2019s best hope for creating jobs is to create a positive business climate.Mr. Trump is focusing his resources on existing firms \u2014 the cars already parked there \u2014 rather than on the millions of potential entrepreneurs who might open the next generation of businesses.Mr. Trump has also suggested that in the future he might use an alternative strategy: using sticks rather than carrots to keep jobs parked within the United States. But this also seems problematic \u2014 after all, would you choose to park in a location where parking attendants harass you when it\u2019s time to leave?The economics of parking contain a big lesson for the Trump administration: A parking garage stays full, and an economy stays healthy, only if it\u2019s constantly refreshed.Advertisement"}

Young People Don\u2019t Get It.", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 At 12:30 p.m. on a recent Wednesday, the Ministry of the Environment offices here were almost completely in darkness, lit only by the silver-blue glow of computer screens.All of the government ministry offices are supposed to go dark for an hour in the middle of each day to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Satoru Morishita, deputy director general of global environment affairs at the ministry, said the policy is a daily reminder of the stakes of climate change.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to change behaviors in addition to changing attitudes on climate change, and from that, to change the whole society,\u201d Mr. Morishita said in an interview.Because Japan has to import most of its energy, and because of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, the country has an almost obsessive interest in tackling energy issues. The apparent drop in concern by Japanese young people alarms many in government, including Mr. Morishita.\u201cI want young people to understand that climate change is their problem, too, and to act on it,\u201d he said.This nation\u2019s approach to fighting climate change provides an illuminating contrast both to other countries straining to engage the public on the issue and to those that deny it altogether. While the United States took a global leadership role on climate change under President Obama, President-elect Donald J. Trump appears uncertain whether climate change is real, or if it is, how to deal with it.The Japanese people, though largely united in recognizing the threat of global warming and rising sea levels, are likely to face hurdles in reforming their energy policy, including some resistance from young people who say the nation faces more pressing problems, like the economy.To spur interest among the young and old, the government last summer began a campaign called \u201cCool Choice,\u201d which encourages consumers to buy energy-efficient appliances.So far, some young people seem unmoved by the government\u2019s efforts.Sui William McCauley, 24, a graduate student in journalism at Waseda University here, shrugged at the public education campaigns. \u201cThat just feels like, whatever,\u201d said Mr. McCauley, who grew up in Sendai, north of Tokyo on Japan\u2019s main island.\u201cMaybe if they say you should drink whiskey when it\u2019s cold, I\u2019ll do that,\u201d he said.His view might reflect a much deeper generational divide in Japan, according to Midori Aoyagi, principal researcher in the Integrated Environment and Economy Section of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, who studies public opinion on climate change in Japan.She said that in her focus groups with Japanese millennials, she \u201calways felt a kind of hopelessness\u201d toward their everyday lives, their careers and social issues, possibly a result of having grown up during a prolonged period of economic stagnation known as the lost decades.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Interviews with several Japanese students and office workers ages 22 to 26 elicited similar responses to arguments for the need for urgency on fighting climate change. The young cited the huge scale and timeline of the problem, a feeling of powerlessness, silence from the media, and preoccupation with more important issues.Several said other issues seemed more pressing for Japan than climate change: a stagnating economy, a declining population and tensions in East Asia, to name a few. Many worried about energy security \u2014 only three of the country\u2019s 45 nuclear reactors are now operational, a result of safety concerns after Fukushima \u2014 and expressed hope that Japan would invest more in renewable energy.Most of them said they didn\u2019t really believe that almost 75 percent of their contemporaries were actually interested in climate change. It might be considered rude in Japan to say you are not interested in something, and most Japanese people know they are supposed to care, even if that rarely translates to action.Maki Nakamatsu, 24, a graduate student at Waseda University, said the government should spend less effort on a public awareness campaign \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d she said \u2014 and more on encouraging or requiring environmentally conscious behavior.An inherent tension between the seeming ineffectiveness of immediate and individual action and the long view the government is trying to take here may be common to every society trying to reduce emissions and to encourage participation.Campaigns and voluntary programs like the ones Japan has started are \u201crelatively small bore,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, a research scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the director of its climate change communication program. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for individual people to see how those behaviors relate to climate change.\u201dThat seems to be part of the problem for many young Japanese like Shota Kanai, 23, an analyst at an e-commerce company in Tokyo.\u201cThis issue is too big,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cand I feel my actions cannot make any difference.\u201dMaya Houser contributed translation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Hacks Followed Years of Paranoia Toward Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterRussia\u2019s unprecedented intervention in the United States election came amid more than United States-Russia tension and Donald J. Trump\u2019s praise of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. It also coincided with a growing belief, in Moscow, that Russia faced an imminent threat in Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy.Mrs. Clinton is viewed in Moscow as innately hostile to Russia. Widely held conspiracy theories portray her as seeking to foment unrest that will return Russia to the chaos and depression of the 1990s. Even many government technocrats view her with suspicion that at times verges on paranoia.She referred to these views at an event on Thursday, telling donors that Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cpersonal beef\u201d with her had driven Russia\u2019s intervention in the American election.Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations, based in Prague, said the Kremlin was consumed by something more urgent than petty revenge: self-preservation.\u201cIt\u2019s not just they didn\u2019t like Clinton, but they actually thought that she represented a threat,\u201d he said, describing Russia\u2019s actions as a matter of \u201cpolicy, not pique.\u201dNo one factor can fully explain Russia\u2019s decision to hack and pass on Democratic emails, analysts say, and intelligence agencies appear divided on assessing Russian motives. But, in Moscow, fear of Mrs. Clinton has loomed as large or larger than any warmth for Mr. Trump.\u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d he said, reflecting a widespread view in Moscow that Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, had sought to topple Russia\u2019s government.Mr. Putin returned to the presidency a few months later, appearing to believe that the United States had engineered the Middle East\u2019s descent into chaos and was targeting his country to be next. He put Mrs. Clinton at the center of these plots.Mrs. Clinton is indeed more hawkish than other Democrats, including toward Russia. In 2008, while a senator, she mocked President George W. Bush\u2019s claim that he had looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s soul.But the Kremlin\u2019s views of Mrs. Clinton go beyond defining her as hawkish. They are also layered with a pre-existing Russian belief that American democracy promotion is a ploy to unseat unfriendly governments, that the United States remains bent on Russia\u2019s destabilization or even destruction, and that there is an American hand behind nearly every Russian misfortune.These suspicions go back decades. But, since Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, popular telling has cast her as the culprit responsible for America\u2019s misdeeds and, therefore, Russia\u2019s setbacks.In the summer of 2015, when Russian hacking groups first infiltrated Democratic National Committee servers, I happened to be reporting in Moscow. The American name on everyone\u2019s lips was not Mr. Trump\u2019s, who was already praising Mr. Putin, but rather Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.Consensus in Moscow, Mr. Lukyanov said, was that \u201cHillary is the worst option of any president, maybe worse than any Republican.\u201dIt was conventional wisdom, he added, that Mrs. Clinton considered her husband\u2019s efforts to reform Russia in the 1990s an unfinished project, and that she would seek to finish it by encouraging grass-roots efforts that would culminate with regime change.This summer, when Russian hacking groups began releasing Democratic emails through third parties such as WikiLeaks, many Americans suspected an effort to help Mr. Trump, who had promised to realign the United States with Russia.But Mr. Galeotti, the Russian expert, said that, in all his time in Moscow, \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to anyone who thought a Trump presidency was possible.\u201dRather, conversation there followed the same polls that dominated the discussion in America, and which all projected a landslide for Mrs. Clinton.Even as Mr. Putin deemed Mr. Trump \u201ccolorful\u201d and suggested they might get along, officials in Moscow \u201cwere absolutely working from the assumption that Clinton was going to get it,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said.This belief may have informed Russia\u2019s actions during the campaign, which a number of analysts still suspect were aimed at weakening, rather then preventing, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presumedly imminent presidency.But if Moscow does gain an ally in Mr. Trump, it will lose a foil in Mrs. Clinton \u2014 something that has been politically useful for Mr. Putin as his country\u2019s economy has sunk and its isolation deepened.Advertisement"}

There is no narrative or dialogue \u2014 everything is purely conveyed through visual language.Such is the conceptual simplicity behind the little moments throughout Richard McGuire\u2019s charming \u201cSequential Drawings.\u201d Collecting over a decade\u2019s worth of spot illustrations for The New Yorker, the art book showcases McGuire\u2019s mastery of form and economy along with his knack for highlighting the often overlooked bits of our daily lives.As in his loudly (and deservedly) praised 2014 graphic novel \u201cHere,\u201d McGuire\u2019s singular, virtuoso approach to storytelling is again the star. Whereas \u201cHere,\u201d with its static living room scene and bold leaps forward and backward in time, explores a simultaneous vision of space and history, \u201cSequential Drawings\u201d takes a more playful, spare and gag-like approach, wordlessly shuffling between imaginings of the secret lives of diner condiments (\u201cScenes From a Table\u201d) and stylish insects (\u201cInsect Fashion\u201d), inventories of funny hats (\u201cHats\u201d), obstructed faces on the subway (\u201cSubway\u201d) and ice (\u201cIce\u201d).City stories are a particular strength for McGuire. In the bravura opening sequence, \u201cThree Friends,\u201d we are presented with a banal street tableau: mailbox, parking meter, trash bin. Like all things in the city, sentient or not, they are quickly subjected to mistreatment \u2014 a moving truck backs over them, a blizzard envelops them, a puffy-jacketed dog treads over them. Seasons change, bikes get locked to them and subsequently stolen, but the three friends persevere on their sidewalk, a little dinged and maybe urine-stained, but unbroken.In the equally notable city sequence \u201cPigeon,\u201d we watch our titular hero (comically drawn by McGuire with an exaggeratedly round body and a tiny noggin) as it contemplates a crumb, sticks its head in a bag and tries to connect with other avian creatures, be they fellow pigeons or those metal birds, high above. The story ends with our protagonist examining its reflection in a puddle, eyes and expression unchanged and now mirrored.This mirror motif can get a bit overplayed as a final panel (two other stories, \u201cFramed\u201d and \u201cScenes From a Table,\u201d also incorporate the move), along with its cousin, the \u201chere\u2019s looking directly at you\u201d motif, repeated in the parting moments of \u201cSubway,\u201d \u201cWindows,\u201d \u201cBirth\u201d and \u201cFramed\u201d (which consists of both the mirror and the \u201clooking directly at you\u201d moves, though in this instance it\u2019s actually kind of neat).Occasional final panel quibbles aside, \u201cSequential Drawings\u201d (and perhaps spot illustration in general) is meant to be light, airy and likable, and there\u2019s a lot to like in it \u2014 not the least of which is McGuire\u2019s ceaselessly inventive, witty and nimble sensibility. The hyperversatile McGuire has made an impressive career out of uncommon progressions, having first entered the avant-garde\u2019s consciousness in the 1980s as the propulsive bass player in no-wave pioneers Liquid Liquid. Since then he has designed his own line of toys, written and illustrated children\u2019s books, animated short films, illustrated covers for The New Yorker and majorly influenced the comic-book titan Chris Ware. It\u2019s fitting that with \u201cSequential Drawings,\u201d McGuire has given us another original and pleasurable work, as freewheeling, artful and exuberant as the artist himself.James Yeh is a writer and culture editor at Vice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbus Will Sell 100 Planes to Iran After Similar Boeing Deal", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byThe European aircraft manufacturer Airbus completed a deal on Thursday to sell 100 jetliners to Iran, a move described by both sides as a major step toward revitalizing Iran\u2019s aged commercial fleet after years of sanctions and economic isolation.Both sales were possible because of provisions in the nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers that took effect nearly a year ago, which lifted many sanctions on Iran in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work.Despite sharp criticism of the nuclear agreement by President-elect Donald J. Trump and the Republican-led Congress, and the possibility that they could subvert it, both aviation companies moved forward with their deals, which were in the works for months.Their combined value could be more than $26 billion, and they could help employ many thousands of workers in the United States and Europe. Many Airbus components are made in the United States and are subject to American export controls.Airbus said it expected to start deliveries in early 2017. Boeing has said it expects to start deliveries in 2018.Farhad Parvaresh, chairman and chief executive of Iran Air, the national airline taking delivery of the planes, called the deal \u201cthe next decisive phase\u201d in the renewal of the airline\u2019s commercial fleet.Iranian officials have said they will need to buy at least 400 planes in the coming years to refurbish Iran\u2019s fleet, one of the world\u2019s oldest. It includes some Boeing models that predate the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah.The acquisition of modern planes is an important achievement for President Hassan Rouhani, who pledged when elected three years ago that he would negotiate a nuclear deal to help alleviate the economic privation caused by sanctions. Mr. Rouhani faces re-election next year.Proponents of the agreements with Boeing and Airbus hope that Mr. Trump, who has described Iran as a leading sponsor of terrorism, will judge the deals by the gains they provide for employment and exports. Boeing has suggested that its planned Iran sales will support tens of thousands of jobs.\u201cWhen Boeing and Airbus come forward with these massive deals, with these jobs, these things will have an impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based group that is critical of Iran\u2019s leaders but has called for improved ties and fewer sanctions.\u201cTrump made a big deal out of saving 1,000 jobs at Carrier in Indiana,\u201d Mr. Parsi said. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that Trump is sensitive to economic arguments.\u201dMr. Trump has sent mixed messages about his intentions on the nuclear agreement that made the aviation deals possible. He has called it a disaster but has not specified what he will seek to change. Some sanctions experts suggest he will do nothing, at least initially.The nuclear agreement contains provisions that could snap sanctions back into place if Iran is found to be violating the terms, raising the possibility that Boeing and Airbus would have to suspend or cancel the sales and repossess planes already delivered.American critics of Iran say the sales could also face problems if Iran Air were found to be violating other, nonnuclear American sanctions on Iran \u2014 for example, by transporting arms to Syria or to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group that the United States regards as a terrorist organization.Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that has been highly critical of Iran and the nuclear agreement, said the aircraft sales were \u201can enormous risk by Airbus and Boeing.\u201dMr. Dubowitz said it was possible that both companies would seek to expedite production and delivery schedules so that many jobs would be at risk if Mr. Trump took action against Iran.\u201cIt creates a de facto barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be more difficult for Trump to say, \u2018The deals are off.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Robot Revolution Will Be the Quietest One", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byTurning PointsIn 2016, self-driving cars made inroads in several countries, many of which rewrote their laws to accommodate the new technology. As a science-fiction writer, it\u2019s my duty to warn the human race that the robot revolution has begun \u2014 even if no one has noticed yet.When a few autonomous test cars appeared on the roads over the last few years, we didn\u2019t think of them as robots because they didn\u2019t have the humanoid shape that science-fiction movies taught us to expect. In 2016, they were adopted widely: as buses in the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, taxis in Singapore and private cars in the United States and China. There was a fatal accident in Florida involving an autonomous car, which caused some concerns, but this did not significantly affect our embrace of this technology.Instead of arming ourselves against this alien presence, as some of my fellow science-fiction writers have fearfully suggested, we gawked as the vehicles pulled up to the curb. The driverless vehicles, some of which had no steering wheels or gas pedals, merged into traffic and stopped at stop signs, smoothly taking us to our destinations. We lounged in comfort, occasionally taking selfies.Machine learning has been an important tool for autonomous car companies as they develop the systems that pilot their vehicles. Instead of rigidly following programming as an app on your phone does, an A.I. system can try to learn to do a task itself, using techniques borrowed from human learning, like pattern recognition and trial and error, and may use hardware modeled on the architecture of a human brain. Currently, the responsibilities of artificial intelligence are mostly limited to tasks like translating texts, helping with medical diagnoses and writing simple articles for media companies. But we can expect to see unimaginable progress in this field in future \u2014 and the widespread use of the autonomous car is going to accelerate that process as automobile and technology companies invest ever more resources in its development.Let\u2019s try to envision that future. As during every other technological revolution, the robots will first transform our economy. People who drive for a living will lose their jobs \u2014 around 3 million in the United States alone. E-commerce may experience further booms because of automation, and car ownership is likely to become nearly obsolete as more targeted car sharing and public transportation systems are developed. Eventually, the robot cars could be integrated with other transportation systems. Say that you live in New York City and want to go to China\u2019s Henan Province: You will enter the address into an app, a car will take you to your plane at the airport, and after you land, another will take you directly to your destination.Robots will begin to creep into other areas of our lives \u2014 serving as busboys or waiters, for example \u2014 as our investments in robotic transport improve their prowess in areas such as environmental detection and modeling, hyper-complex problem solving and fuzzy-logic applications. With every advance, the use of A.I.-powered robots will expand into other fields: health care, policing, national defense and education.There will be scandals when things go wrong and backlash movements from the new Luddites. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll protest very much. The A.I. systems that drive our cars will teach us to trust machine intelligence over the human variety \u2014 car accidents will become very rare, for example \u2014 and when given an opportunity to delegate a job to a robot, we will placidly do so without giving it much thought.In all previous technological revolutions, people who lost their jobs mostly moved to new ones, but that will be less likely when the robots take over. A.I. that can learn from experience will replace many accountants, lawyers, bankers, insurance adjusters, doctors, scientific researchers and some creative professionals. Intelligence and advanced training will no longer mean job stability.Gradually the A.I. era will transform the essence of human culture. When we\u2019re no longer more intelligent than our machines, when they can easily outthink and outperform us, making the sort of intuitive leaps in research and other areas that we currently associate with genius, a sort of learned helplessness is likely to set in for us, and the idea of work itself may cease to hold meaning.As A.I. takes over, the remaining jobs may dwindle to a fraction of what they were, employing perhaps 10 percent or even less of the total population. These may be highly creative or complex jobs that robots can\u2019t do, such as senior management, directing scientific research or nursing and child care.In the dystopian scenario, as jobless numbers rise across the globe, our societies sink into prolonged turmoil. The world could be engulfed by endless conflicts between those who control the A.I. and the rest of us. The technocratic 10 percent could end up living in a gated community with armed robot guards.There is a second, utopian scenario, where we\u2019ve anticipated these changes and come up with solutions beforehand. Those in political power have planned a smoother, gentler transition, perhaps using A.I. to help them anticipate and modulate the strife. At the end of it, almost all of us live on social welfare.How we will spend our time is hard to predict. \u201cHe who does not work, neither shall he eat\u201d has been the cornerstone of civilizations through the ages, but that will have vanished. History shows that those who haven\u2019t had to work \u2014 aristocrats, say \u2014 have often spent their time entertaining and developing their artistic and sporting talents while scrupulously observing elaborate rituals of dress and manners.In this future, creativity is highly valued. We sport ever more fantastic makeup, hairstyles and clothing. The labor of past ages seems barbaric.But the aristocrats ruled nations; in the A.I. era, machines are doing all the thinking. Because, over the decades, we\u2019ve gradually given up our autonomy, step by step, allowing ourselves to be transformed into A.I.\u2019s docile, fabulously pampered pets. As A.I. whisks us from place to place \u2014 visits to family members, art galleries and musical events \u2014 we will look out the windows, as unaware of its plans for us as a poodle on its way to the groomer\u2019s.The science-fiction writer Liu Cixin is a nine-time winner of the Galaxy Award, China\u2019s highest honor for science-fiction writing.

{"Headline": "Why Venezuela Should Default", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNew York \u2014 Guess which country has recently shown the greatest willingness to weather hardship in order to pay its foreign bondholders? Paradoxically, it\u2019s the country that has been among the most vocal in its anticapitalist rhetoric. Venezuela continues to pay despite an economic crisis that would have stymied other sovereign borrowers long ago. Riots prompted by a shortage of cash are just the latest example of the country\u2019s economic crisis. Although reallocating funds from debt service to the importation of much-needed food and medicine is tempting, the government fears that subsequent lawsuits could actually leave less money for imports.These fears are overstated. Venezuela already faces the typical costs of sovereign default, such as the loss of access to international credit markets and a decline in foreign direct investment, even though it remains up to date on its debt service. With default seemingly inevitable, the country must eventually confront any other consequences, which are unlikely to include the dreaded seizure of Venezuelan oil tankers at sea. Meanwhile, postponing default is costly to the economy and unfair to long-term creditors.The government has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid default. For example, in order to secure a two-year reprieve on the repayment of $2.8 billion in bonds, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company PDVSA agreed to repay an additional 20 percent of that amount and also pledged as collateral half of Citgo, the American oil refinery whose value far exceeds the amount of debt refinanced. Similarly, in order to fend off a $769 million lawsuit by the Canadian mining company Gold Reserve over an expropriation, the Venezuelan government will not only honor the full claim, but also grant Gold Reserve the rights to 45 percent of a new mining company, essentially paying twice.Some stakeholders argue, perhaps self-servingly, that the government should continue to resort to extraordinary measures to meet its international obligations. The government could sell its vast oil reserves, for example, as they are the largest in the world.Such measures are typically justified by portraying the legal consequences of a default with a parade of horribles. Consider what happened to Congo. The hedge fund Kensington, a subsidiary of the distressed debt investor Elliott Management, purchased defaulted Congolese debt for cents on the dollar in the late 1990s. In 2005, Kensington managed to intercept the Nordic Hawk, a tanker ship carrying $39 million in oil, and proved to a British judge that the oil originated in Congo, despite elaborate efforts by Congolese government officials to disguise the source of the ship\u2019s cargo.Venezuelan oil exports, which are an order of magnitude larger than those from Congo, cannot be immediately seized. Instead, a legal cat-and-mouse game would ensue upon default. If creditors try to confiscate tankers of oil, Venezuela will ensure that, contractually, that oil is the property of the buyer before it leaves Venezuela. If creditors go after the money paid for that oil, Venezuela will reroute that money through China to evade them. Venezuela could also sell more oil through joint ventures and to China to further complicate matters for plaintiffs.Litigation would surely take a long time. Congo defaulted on its external debt in 1985, but did not reach a settlement with Kensington until 2008. Similarly, Argentina managed to evade creditors like Elliott Management for over a decade before ultimately reaching an agreement to pay only 75 percent of the amount owed. Judge Thomas P. Griesa, the United States District Court judge handling the case, frustrated by Argentina\u2019s decade-long intransigence despite a strong economic recovery post-default, ultimately forced Argentina to pay, but also quickly extricated himself from the case once Argentina had made a reasonable offer.Considering Venezuela\u2019s dire economic situation, a United States court is unlikely to grant any immediate preliminary relief to hedge funds ahead of a lengthy proceeding on the merits. In the meantime, Venezuela would save around $10 billion in annual debt service, an amount sufficient to restock empty supermarket shelves by funding an estimated 50 percent increase in imports. By alleviating shortages, these funds would give the current government, or a future government, some breathing room to enact economic reforms that would spur growth and assure long-term viability, reforms that have so far proved politically elusive. Venezuela may eventually have to pay what it owes, but that will be easier than overpaying now.Whatever the consequences of default, they can only be postponed, not avoided. Central Bank reserves are dwindling, oil production is falling, and the economy faces recession and hyperinflation. Many bonds can be purchased for only 40 cents on the dollar because the market believes default is just a matter of time.Despite the government\u2019s extraordinary efforts, creditors are actually not being treated fairly. While short-term creditors are paid in full, long-term creditors may not be paid at all. Every time the country pledges assets as collateral or sells the rights to natural resources, it subordinates and dilutes the claims of typically unsecured long-term creditors. Now is the worst time to sell Venezuela\u2019s natural resources, considering the uncertain political and economic environment.The pension funds and other institutional investors that loaned Venezuela money over the past decade deserve to be repaid. Nevertheless, Venezuela does not need to take its assets to the pawnshop. Most investors would be happy to postpone debt service payments in return for a credible commitment to economic reforms, like exchange rate unification; default, or the threat of default, would discourage any holdouts.Once the country stabilizes, the government can offer a restructuring that includes a maturity extension and deferral of interest payments in return for warrants that pay when oil prices rise, allowing bondholders to share in the upside. Incentives for litigation for hedge funds would be few if the restructuring were fair. Both the country and its creditors would be better off in this scenario than in a continued fire sale of Venezuela\u2019s remaining assets.Joe Kogan is the co-head of Latin America Strategy at Scotiabank in New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Margot Wallstrom on Feminism, Trump and Sweden\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Margot Wallstrom, Sweden\u2019s top diplomat, has sought to advance what she calls a feminist foreign policy. What does that mean?She says it is a way to use the usual tools of diplomacy to address three questions: Do women have equal rights? Are women at the decision-making table? And, are resources equitably distributed to women?\u201cA feminist foreign policy,\u201d she said, \u201cis an analysis of the world.\u201dThat worldview will be put to its biggest test yet next month, when Sweden will begin a two-year term on the United Nations Security Council, including serving as the body\u2019s president, just as Russia and the United States seem poised for conflict.Last year, she criticized Saudi Arabia\u2019s restrictions against women, spurring a diplomatic spat: The kingdom recalled its ambassador to Sweden and temporarily refused to issue business visas to Swedes. The move sent chills through Sweden\u2019s business community. Saudi Arabia is an important trading partner, and Ms. Wallstrom is quick to say that relations have since normalized.Ms. Wallstrom must contend with what she calls Russia\u2019s \u201cprovocative posture,\u201d and an incoming American administration that she worries is uninterested in international cooperation. Sweden has staunchly held out against joining NATO, the Western military alliance, and, until recently, its defense budget had been steadily shrinking.As Sweden prepares for its term on the Security Council, I sat down with Ms. Wallstrom in New York to discuss President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, the future of NATO and the international refugee crisis.This interview has been edited and condensed.I will, of course, use the argument that this will make America great again: if he includes women and makes sure he works for gender equality. Without it, he will not be able to make America great again. It is smart policy. It is not just the right thing to do.I don\u2019t think anyone is worried they would proactively break a deal that is beneficial to both sides. I don\u2019t think we should speculate. You should be judged by what you do. We just have to prepare. We have to stand our ground and present our arguments. We have to cooperate, and we have to insist on wanting to continue our close contacts.We are an independent country that has chosen for 200 years to be militarily nonaligned. It has served us well. We have to be credible by also showing we are ready to defend ourselves. We have a worsening security situation in our neighborhood. It\u2019s a threat to the European security order since Russia has illegally annexed Crimea. We see threats of the use of nuclear weapons. They have had a very provocative posture in our neighborhood, not that we see they are direct threats to our territorial integrity or our security. There are no direct threats to Sweden. But it\u2019s a behavior that\u2019s been very provocative.Right now, we are very comfortable where we are. We don\u2019t want to be under a nuclear weapon umbrella, and we think we should stay militarily nonaligned. We are in a good position, especially now, when we don\u2019t know what will happen with NATO with the new commander in chief in the United States or with Turkey being increasingly difficult, as well. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what Trump will do with NATO.It\u2019s not as though we have closed our borders, but we apply a stricter rule book, so to say. We could not take so many people, especially so many children. We needed to have other European countries to step up. Those we gave asylum to are supposed to enjoy the same rights and opportunities and possibilities as those who have been living in Sweden a long time. This is our principle. We have to build houses, we have to make sure there are schools. We needed over 30,000 new teachers all over the country. In the end, you need also public support to continue to be generous. So you need a balance.We don\u2019t have any rules about that. You can wear a head scarf. It\u2019s not a problem.The lack of conviction about multilateral solutions. Because most of the problems we see are global. If a big country or a superpower like the United States says it will not even honor its signature on the climate deal in Paris, that worries me a lot. We want to find solutions that are of mutual interest, that create a win-win situation with the United States. Engaging in trade will bring more jobs and a better economy on both sides. The trans-Atlantic link is good for security on both sides. And those are the arguments that we have to use, maybe not so much of ideology or party lines or values. Maybe that\u2019s what he will understand best.An article on Dec. 19 about Margot Wallstrom, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, referred incorrectly to her country\u2019s position on Palestinian statehood.

{"Headline": "Surge in Dollar Provokes Jitters in Emerging Markets Around World", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byThe election of Donald J. Trump has set off a monthlong run of investor ebullience, whose highlight has been a sustained increase in the value of the dollar against the world\u2019s currencies.It is a surge that has been embraced on Wall Street as a powerful emblem for a United States economy potentially poised to hit a higher gear thanks to tax cuts, government spending and regulatory relief \u2014 policy measures that the president-elect has promised to enact immediately.But around the globe, the surge in the dollar is provoking financial jitters.Emerging market countries and corporations that have been binging on cheap dollar debt for more than a decade now face a spike in servicing costs and elevated debt burdens.And the global financial giants \u2014 banks, insurance companies and mutual, pension and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 that have financed this $10 trillion borrowing bonanza must confront a period of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions that will make them less willing to extend credit to companies and investors alike.\u201cIt is the ubiquitous nature of the dollar and its role in the global banking system,\u201d said Hyun Song Shin, the head of research at the Bank of International Settlements, a forum for global central banks. \u201cWhen the dollar goes up, it directly impairs the risk-taking capacities of banks and investors alike.\u201dA sharp move up in the currency should be seen as a blinking red warning light for investors, he wrote. When it moves in the other direction, then it is \u201crisk on,\u201d to use trader parlance for when it is time to lay down speculative bets.Since the election last month, a broad index for the dollar has risen 4 percent. This move, however, masks even sharper increases against a number of currencies.The dollar has gained 10 percent against the Mexican peso and 8 percent against the Japanese yen.Against the Chinese yuan, the move has been less pronounced \u2014 just 1.5 percent. But Mr. Trump\u2019s combative language toward China has ignited concerns in Beijing that local savers will try to send more of their deposits abroad, putting more downward pressure on the yuan.The rockiest reaction so far to the dollar\u2019s tear has been in Turkey.When the Turkish lira fell to its lowest level in decades against the dollar last week, the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took the unusual step of urging Turks to sell the dollars that they had been hoarding and buy their local currency.With its high levels of debt in dollars and reliance on volatile capital flows for its financing needs, Turkey, more than most of its peers, has been vulnerable to the episodic fits of the emerging markets contagion that have plagued the global economy in recent decades.Boldly new, as well as contentious, Mr. Shin\u2019s thesis has not been wholly embraced by economists and policy makers.For example, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the regulator that keeps the closest eye on incipient financial risks, has made it clear on numerous occasions that the dollar\u2019s recent rise should be seen as a positive sign.It is not just what a strong dollar says about a growing United States economy, but it is the further prospect that, as a result, Japan and Europe may also emerge from their years of deflationary slough.But as Mr. Shin and his team of economists at the Bank of International Settlements see it, it is not just the threat of the dollar\u2019s rise precipitating a crisis in a dollar-sensitive market like Turkey, South Africa or Brazil that is cause for worry.His concerns also center on the global banking system and the possibility that the dollar\u2019s rise will accentuate what he refers to as an emerging dearth of dollars, which could bring back memories of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when a global rush into dollars created a liquidity panic.Short-term borrowing rates skyrocketed, forcing hedge funds to shut down and banks to fail.\u201cThe lessons of the dollar is that everything is connected,\u201d he said. \u201cSpillovers and spill backs can loom large.Since the election, the cost of borrowing dollars short term in all these currencies has risen markedly, with Japan being the outlier.Connections between sustained periods of dollar strength and bouts of financial instability have been drawn by other analysts, like Julian Brigden at Macro 2 Intelligence Partners. In particular, he points to two such periods.The first is 1979 to 1985, when the dollar rose over 80 percent after Paul A. Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, increased interest rates and President Ronald Reagan came to power pushing tax cuts.Then there were the years between 1995 to 2002, when currency crises rippled through Southeast Asia and the implosion of the dot-com boom in the United States rocked stock markets.That would be the flip side of quantitative easing, the policy of the past decade where central banks have flooded the world with cash in a bid to spur growth and combat deflation.\u201cThis is a concern for Fed Chair Yellen,\u201d said Paul Christopher, an investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. \u201cIn the type of global economy we live in, she has to be careful about the dollar increasing too much, creating dollar shortages and liquidity problems as a result.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the surge in the dollar and its effects on emerging markets misstated a goal of quantitative easing. It is to combat deflation, not inflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Earth, the Final Frontier", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorRochester \u2014 On April 1, 1960, the newly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration heaved a 270-pound box of electronics into Earth orbit. In those days, getting anything into space was a major achievement. But the real significance of that early satellite, Tiros-1, was not its survival, but its mission: Its sensors were not pointed outward toward deep space, but downward, at the Earth.Tiros-1 was the first world\u2019s first weather satellite. After its launch, Americans would never again be caught without warning as storms approached.NASA critics have long wanted to shut the agency out of research related to climate change. The problem is, not only is earth science a long-running part of NASA\u2019s \u201cprime mission,\u201d but it is uniquely positioned to do it. Without NASA, climate research worldwide would be hobbled.NASA\u2019s role in earth science began at its inception: The Space Act of 1958, which created NASA, made the study of our atmosphere one of its top priorities. During the Reagan years, Congress amended the act to make Earth the first of NASA\u2019s nine fundamental missions. Right now there are at least 15 earth-science satellites that NASA helped build, launch and operate; they monitor everything from global rainfall to soil moisture.These spacecraft foster billions of dollars of economic activity and affect millions of lives. Soil moisture measurements, for example, make their way back to farmers planning their crops. Ice-pattern measurements find their way to the shipping industry for navigation. Space-based measurements of environmental conditions make it to medical workers predicting the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses.None of these missions were explicitly designed to study climate change. They were planned to study the Earth, which naturally includes the climate. But the data from these missions tell us that Earth\u2019s climate is changing.The sheer scale of NASA\u2019s 60-year mission to study Earth is why conclusions about climate change caused by human activity are so firmly established. And it\u2019s that scale that makes proposals to move NASA\u2019s earth-science program somewhere else a recipe for taxpayer waste.Critics make it seem like the program\u2019s $2 billion budget goes to a handful of climate-crazed computer modelers, and that moving earth science from NASA would just be an exercise in pushing desks around. But that money covers a lot: It goes to thousands of technicians building satellites for NASA and its contractors. It goes to people at Cape Canaveral who launch satellites atop of 100-foot pillars of high explosives. It goes to engineers operating those satellites as they wheel some 300 miles overhead.NASA\u2019s storied success comes in part through its economies of scale. Engineers building instruments for a Mars mission will bring their expertise to developing sensors for an earth-science satellite. Thus the kind of experience NASA has built isn\u2019t fungible. Just as it would be folly to ask the Army to build and operate submarines, asking someone else to do NASA\u2019s job would be an invitation to organizational chaos.Agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Geological Survey also represent monumental accomplishments of American science. But neither has the reach or experience to take on what America asks of NASA. NOAA, an agency of the Department of Commerce, has a budget of just $6 billion, a fraction of which is spent on earth science. Asking it to absorb part or all of NASA\u2019s earth science effort would be like watching a snake try to swallow an elephant.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Joins Line of Critics of Costly Fighter Jet", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the cost of building the military\u2019s next-generation fighter jet, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, had spiraled \u201cout of control,\u201d and he vowed to save billions of dollars on military programs once he enters office next month.In a Twitter post on Monday morning and a series of comments since last week, the president-elect assailed cost overruns for the Lockheed Martin-built fighter jet that have pushed the project\u2019s cost beyond $400 billion, making the plane the most expensive weapons system in military history.Mr. Trump\u2019s verbal assault on the F-35 continued a pattern in which the president-elect has targeted businesses for criticism and threatened presidential action. Since winning the election, he has challenged Boeing to lower the cost of upgrades to Air Force One, stepped in to stop Carrier from sending jobs to Mexico and taken credit for billions of dollars in investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.But in pursuing the F-35 program, Mr. Trump may be facing a target that even he cannot budge.The president-elect is just the latest in a long line of critics in both parties who have beat up on the 15-year project, only to see it survive thanks to deep political support across the country. Lockheed has spread work on the F-35 to hundreds of subcontractors in most of the 50 states, and members of Congress typically oppose any cuts that would cost jobs in their states or districts.It is unclear what alternative the president-elect could embrace if the military turns away from the F-35 this late in the jet\u2019s development; the government has spent about $100 billion on the project, and 204 planes have been built. The Pentagon, under Robert M. Gates, the secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011, canceled a different fighter jet, the F-22, leaving nothing but the F-35 to replace aging fighters used by the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines.Once in office, Mr. Trump could try to shrink overall costs by trimming back plans to buy more than 2,400 planes. But doing so simply pushes up the price of each jet. And that in turn could provoke diplomatic incidents with American allies who have contracted to add F-35s to their militaries. Higher costs per plane could exceed their budgets, as well.In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s public criticism of the plane may be about sending a warning message to private companies that contract with the military. While Mr. Trump said throughout the campaign that he would rebuild the nation\u2019s military, his Twitter post on Monday signaled to contractors that they should not try to fleece the federal government.The immediate impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on Monday was financial: After it was published, shares of Lockheed Martin had fallen by 4 percent around midday, reducing the company\u2019s market value by about $4 billion, before rebounding somewhat. Lockheed shares ended the day down about 2.5 percent, closing at $253.11 a share.Mr. Trump posted on Twitter just as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was in Israel to welcome the arrival of two F-35s, the first of a new-generation fleet meant to help maintain Israel\u2019s air superiority in the region.Speaking at the ceremony, Mr. Carter described the F-35 as \u201cthe most advanced aircraft in history\u201d and said, \u201cIsrael is our first and only friend in the region that is flying\u201d it.Lockheed Martin\u2019s program manager for the F-35, Jeff A. Babione, who was also in Israel for the planes\u2019 arrival, said, \u201cI certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question the president-elect would have about the program.\u201dMr. Babione added that Lockheed had invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane. Lockheed said that if the government stuck to plans to increase production, it could reduce the average price for each F-35 by 2020 to $85 million, about the same as less sophisticated fighters cost.The F-35 was designed as a state-of-the-art aircraft for all of the branches of the United States military, with the goal of overwhelming adversaries with technological superiority. The jet would be able to evade radar and dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles while giving pilots a better picture of enemy threats advancing toward them.But despite initial promises that the all-in-one plane would save taxpayer money, costs have veered sharply higher over 15 years of development.Mr. Trump has not said how he will seize control of the project\u2019s costs, which have risen despite repeated attempts over more than a decade to restrain spending and fix costly mistakes.In an interview on Sunday, and in a speech to supporters in Michigan on Friday, the president-elect accused military officials of failing to negotiate good deals with private-sector contractors because they know they might be hired by the companies after their military service ends.\u201cThe people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cYou know, they make a deal like that, and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal.\u201dMr. Trump said military officials who were in charge of negotiating multibillion-dollar deals like the F-35 project should be barred for life from employment with the companies that they worked with, though he did not cite any examples involving the fighter plane. That would be an expansion of the president-elect\u2019s proposal that people who work for his administration be barred from lobbying for five years.In a hearing this year, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, demonstrated the dilemma for members of Congress and others who worry about the ballooning cost of the project. He hailed the plane as a needed part of the country\u2019s arsenal even as he criticized the program\u2019s inability to deliver on time and within budget.\u201cThe full capabilities this aircraft will eventually provide are critical to America\u2019s national security,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cBut at the same time, the F-35 program\u2019s record of performance has been both a scandal and a tragedy.\u201dThe technology in the F-35 and other weapons systems is increasingly complex, and politics tend to exacerbate the problems. To lock in congressional support, the Pentagon often starts building the weapons before testing is complete. Cutting funding in the middle of programs can increase costs in the long run if it reduces the economies of scale in the manufacturing plants.Pentagon officials said recently that they needed an extra $500 million to finish development of the planes. They have also been wrangling with Lockheed over the price of the latest batch of planes.The F-35 program is also sensitive diplomatically, and as costs per plane increase, the overruns affect the ability of other countries to buy the jets.Israel, for example, has ordered 33 of the stealth fighters at a cost of more than $5.5 billion, to come from the assistance Israel receives from Washington, and the Israeli cabinet decided recently to increase the number of planes to 50.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, Christopher Drew from New York and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shirley Hazzard, Novelist Who Charted Storm-Tossed Lives, Dies at 85", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byShirley Hazzard, the Australian-born author of an acclaimed if small portfolio of fiction peopled with characters whose lives, much like her own, toss them up far from home, died on Monday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.A friend, Annabel Davis-Goff, confirmed the death, adding that Ms. Hazzard had struggled with dementia.Ms. Hazzard\u2019s fiction is dense with meaning, subtle in implication and tense in plot, often with disaster looming: A shipwreck tears away the parents of tiny children. A man who has waited a lifetime for a woman loses her at the last moment. A disease slowly saps the life from a beloved brother. Nuclear weapons wreak destruction and menace the next generation.Catastrophes are accompanied by life\u2019s cruelties: The true love turns out to be the incestuous one. The bureaucrat basks in his power, refusing compassionate leave to an underpaid young worker facing an emergency.Ms. Hazzard\u2019s major characters are fiercely intelligent, with an eye for oddments and battered trinkets to cherish as emotional souvenirs \u2014 like the teacups in the novel \u201cThe Bay of Noon,\u201d veined by time and \u201cheavy with Victorian roses.\u201dBorn in Sydney, Ms. Hazzard lived in Hong Kong, Italy and New Zealand, both with her family and on her own, before landing in the United States at 20, going to work for the United Nations and making a home in New York. She said, however, that she would never consider herself an expatriate\u201cI\u2019m not even sure which country I\u2019d be an expatriate of,\u201d she said.The poet and critic J. D. McClatchy wrote in The Paris Review in 2005 that through her early travel, frequent moves and work for the British government in Hong Kong, Ms. Hazzard \u201ccame by her precocious interest in the heart\u2019s negotiations and the mind\u2019s deceptions in a way few contemporary novelists have.\u201dShe conveyed these complex dramas with an austere economy of words, in slim books of winding sentences. \u201cSpeech \u2014 in literature as in life \u2014 can crucially suggest what is not said,\u201d Ms. Hazzard once remarked.And yet her novel \u201cThe Transit of Venus,\u201d which won the 1980 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction, is \u201cstuffed with description so intellectually active as to be sometimes exhausting,\u201d Thomas Mallon wrote in The Atlantic.\u201cThe Transit of Venus\u201d begins with the shipwreck that orphans the Australian sisters Caro and Grace Bell and traces the hopes of a man who has patiently kept alive a lonely love for Caro across the decades.The novelist John Banville described the novel as \u201cintricately plotted and gorgeously written,\u201d noting that \u201ca peculiar and powerful sense of evil hangs over the narrative, so that even as one is impelled toward the conclusion, one is at the same time fearful of getting there.\u201dTo the disappointment of her admirers, more than 20 years elapsed before Ms. Hazzard followed \u201cThe Transit of Venus\u201d with \u201cThe Great Fire,\u201d which won the 2003 National Book Award for fiction. Mr. Mallon noted that her fans had begrudged her \u201ceven the time she spent on a brief memoir of her friendship with Graham Greene\u201d \u2014 \u201cGreene on Capri,\u201d published in 2000.\u201cThe Great Fire\u201d had been a long time percolating, however, fed by experiences from Ms. Hazzard\u2019s time in Hong Kong and excerpted as early as 1987 in The New Yorker.The novel concerns an improbable couple: Aldred Leith, a British Army officer, and Helen Driscoll, an Australian, who meet in occupied Japan when she is a teenager and he, much older at 32, is engaged in a vague post-Hiroshima project.Intellectual and emotional soul mates despite the gulf between their ages, they create a triangle of friendship with Helen\u2019s dying brother, Benedict.Writing from Leith\u2019s point of view, Ms. Hazzard describes Helen: \u201cMost striking was the girl\u2019s well-being. It was as if, in this child, Benedict had been recreated in radiant health, the hair made glossy, the skin vital, the form sound. With a second try, Nature had pulled it off. The eyes were of the same uncommon clarity, and rounder.\u201dShirley Hazzard was born in Sydney on Jan. 30, 1931, to a Welsh father and a Scottish mother, both of whom had immigrated to Australia and worked for the company building the Sydney Harbor Bridge.Her childhood in Australia was filled with reading \u2014 she said of poems that she \u201cate and drank them up as nourishment\u201d \u2014 but also with family discord, alcoholism, mental illness (her mother\u2019s), infidelity (her father\u2019s) and ultimately the disintegration of her parents\u2019 marriage. She recalled seeing maimed veterans of World War I still haunting Australia years later, and she had felt the effects of the Depression.After World War II, her father joined the Foreign Service and was posted to Hong Kong. Moving to Asia opened a door to the wider world for Ms. Hazzard, but it was also the beginning of a string of wrenching leave-takings.At 16, she began working for the British Combined Intelligence Services in Hong Kong and was submerged \u2014 for a brief, happy period \u2014 in a stimulating social and intellectual atmosphere before being whisked away to New Zealand (as the fictional teenager Helen Driscoll is in \u201cThe Great Fire\u201d) and ultimately to New York.In New York \u2014 she never went to college \u2014 she was employed at the United Nations Secretariat for about a decade, during which time she wrote \u201cPeople in Glass Houses\u201d (1967), a collection of linked stories that satirized the bureaucratic life.She also took aim at the United Nations in her nonfiction, most notably in \u201cCountenance of Truth: The United Nations and the Waldheim Case\u201d (1990), a follow-up to a series of magazine articles she had written beginning in 1980 examining allegations that world powers had been complicit in covering up Kurt Waldheim\u2019s Nazi past before his rise to secretary general.Literary success came to Ms. Hazzard without the usual blizzard of rejection slips. Her long association with The New Yorker began with the first story she submitted, \u201cWoollahra Road,\u201d which had been fished from the slush pile by the fiction editor William Maxwell and published in 1961.In 1963 she met Francis Steegmuller, a Flaubert scholar, writer and translator, at a party given by Muriel Spark. They married later that year.Mr. Steegmuller died in 1994. They had no children. Ms. Hazzard had a sister, Valerie, but had lost touch with her years ago, Ms. Davis-Goff said. There was no information on survivors.Ms. Hazzard\u2019s other fiction includes a collection of short stories, \u201cCliffs of Fall\u201d (1963), and the novel \u201cThe Evening of the Holiday\u201d (1966).She became a United States citizen in the 1970s. Before her husband\u2019s death, as well as in recent years, she divided her time among apartments on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Italy \u2014 on the island of Capri and in Naples. Her time in Naples led to the book \u201cThe Ancient Shore: Dispatches From Naples,\u201d a collaboration with Mr. Steegmuller that was published in 2008.For Ms. Hazzard, Italy was the magic place where, she said in an interview, \u201cthe mysteries remain important: the accidental quality of existence, the poetry of memory, the impassioned life that is animated by awareness of eventual death.\u201dWilliam Grimes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But \u201cwhatever policy prescriptions that we\u2019ve been proposing don\u2019t reach, are not heard, by the folks in these communities.\u201dBut it largely misses the mark. Yes, the economy has added millions of jobs since President Obama took office. Even manufacturing employment has recovered some of its losses. Still, less-educated white voters had a solid economic rationale for voting against the status quo \u2014 nearly all the gains from the economic recovery have passed them by.There are almost nine million more jobs than there were at the previous peak in November 2007, just before the economy tumbled into recession. But the gains have not been evenly distributed.Despite accounting for less than 15 percent of the labor force, Hispanics got more than half of the net additional jobs. Blacks and Asians also gained millions more jobs than they lost. But whites, who account for 78 percent of the labor force, lost more than 700,000 net jobs over the nine years.The racial and ethnic divide is starker among workers in their prime. Whites ages 25 to 54 lost some 6.5 million jobs more than they gained over the period. Hispanics in their prime, by contrast, gained some three million jobs net, Asians 1.5 million and blacks one million.This lopsided racial sorting of jobs is only one of the fault lines brought to the fore by the presidential election.The political divide between high-output and low-output parts of the country also meshes with the cleavage between urban America \u2014 largely won by Mrs. Clinton \u2014 and the vast, less-populous rural stretches where Mr. Trump racked up large numbers of votes.Non-Hispanic whites account for 62 percent of the population. But they make up some 78 percent of the population of nonmetropolitan areas and 71 percent of that of small cities, according to the demographer William H. Frey from Brookings. By contrast, they account for only 56 percent of the population of the 100 largest urban areas in the country.Problem is, many of the jobs created since the economy started recovering from recession were in service industries, located primarily in large metropolitan areas \u2014 not in small towns and rural areas where the factories that once provided steady good jobs were either shuttered or were retooled to replace workers with machines.Metropolitan areas, by contrast, had 5 percent more jobs than they did eight years earlier. And that is where most Hispanics, blacks and Asians live. The low-end service jobs there certainly pay less than those that lifted white blue-collar workers into the middle class. But they do offer a more hopeful future than a shrinking employment base.\u201cIt has been a good decade for metropolitan America,\u201d said Mr. Muro, who heads the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings. By contrast, \u201cyou can\u2019t underestimate the economic and social pain across the rural tier.\u201dGiven such clear divisions \u2014 less-educated whites living in depressed rural areas, on one side, and minorities living in more vigorous big-city economies on the other \u2014 the social and racial animosity manifest during the election campaign is hardly a surprise.So there is a clear economic argument for Mr. Trump\u2019s angry voters to have bucked the establishment.But all that raises a bigger question. Will President Trump deliver on the promises \u2014 the new, well-paying jobs \u2014 that his supporters demand? Mr. Achuthan, for one, thinks not.\u201cTrump will get smacked in about a year or so,\u201d he told me. \u201cRegardless of his policies.\u201dGoods-producing jobs in manufacturing and construction, which had been roughly flat since 1979, plummeted by more than three million before a building boom fueled by an inflating housing bubble clawed back many of them. When that bubble burst, the construction jobs evaporated too. And there has been no new job-producing boom to take its place.Can Mr. Trump do more for his supporters than previous presidents? It\u2019s doubtful. Most of his promises are empty. No matter what he does, he cannot bring back the coal jobs of yore or the old labor-intensive manufacturing economy. Some of his proposals \u2014 walling off the country with protective tariffs, for example \u2014 would make things worse for the middle and working class, while tax cuts for the wealthy will exacerbate inequality rather than lessen it.The job market has tightened and there are a number of underlying forces that may well propel the economy forward for a while in a way that prosperity spreads more outside the major cities. A major program of public investment in infrastructure would probably increase employment, but it is not a long-term solution for a rural population cut off from the most dynamic sectors of the economy.What progress the nation has in store is likely to come through investments in technology and human capital. This will happen mostly in its cities. Less-educated rural whites, with deep roots in their local communities, are often reluctant to move. But that means all too many are likely to be left behind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Can Tell the Future of the Democratic Party?", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byHere\u2019s a question very few people expected to be asking this year: Does the Democratic Party have a future?The defeat of Hillary Clinton has revived with new intensity the conflict between proponents of identity politics \u2014 focusing electoral attention on African-Americans, Hispanics, women and the L.G.B.T. community \u2014 and those who advocate what they describe as a more universal strategy.American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism\u2019s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.Lilla called for a \u201cpost-identity liberalism\u201d that wouldconcentrate on widening its base by appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them.The reaction was swift and fierce.In the new political climate we now inhabit, Duke and Lilla were contributing to the same ideological project, the former cloaked in a KKK hood, the latter in an academic gown. Both men are underwriting the whitening of American nationalism, and the re-centering of white lives as lives that matter most in the U.S. Duke is happy to own the white supremacy of his statements, while Lilla\u2019s op-ed does the more nefarious background work of making white supremacy respectable. Again.On the surface, it looks as if there is no way to find common ground between these warring camps. But in fact it is not an either/or choice; it\u2019s really a matter of emphasis.In her brief public statement at 10 Downing Street on July 13, May broached Britain\u2019s version of identity politics. She declared her commitment to battle \u201cburning injustices\u201d:If you are born poor, you will die on average nine years earlier than others. If you\u2019re black, you\u2019re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you are white. If you\u2019re a white, working-class boy, you\u2019re less likely than anyone else in Britain to go to university. If you\u2019re at a state school, you\u2019re less likely to reach the top professions than if you were educated privately. If you are a woman, you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there\u2019s not enough help to hand.While acknowledging the legitimacy of these deep and abiding problems, May made the case that the larger issue facing British society is the struggle of all those trying to make ends meet:The mission to make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than just fighting these injustices. If you\u2019re from an ordinary working-class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realize. You have the job, but you don\u2019t always have the job security. You have your own home, but you worry about paying the mortgage. You can just about manage, but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school.The core mission of the May government, she promised. would be to lighten the burdens on such \u201cordinary working class\u201d families:We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful but you. When we pass new laws, we\u2019ll listen not to the mighty, but you. When it comes to taxes we\u2019ll prioritize not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won\u2019t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you.In other words, May attempted to address the specific problems of key identity groups, but emphasized that her top priority would be the concerns of all workers regardless of race, sex or ethnicity. The challenge for Democrats in this country going forward is to self-monitor more assiduously for divergence from the May-Timothy strategy. Successful Democratic candidates have often done just that.Taxes were lowered on the wealthiest people whose incomes were rising, and raised on middle class families as their incomes fell. And through it all, millions of decent, ordinary people who worked hard, played by the rules, and took responsibility for their own actions, were falling more and more behind, living a life of struggle without reward or security.I want to set our party and our country on the path toward the new center ground of British politics built on the values of fairness and opportunity where everyone plays by the same rules and where every single person \u2014 regardless of their background or that of their parents \u2014 is given the chance to be all they want to be.In a Clinton Administration, we are going to create opportunity for all. We\u2019ve got to grow this economy, not shrink it. We need to give people incentives to make long \u2014 term investment in America and reward people who produce goods and services, not those who speculate with other people\u2019s money. We\u2019ve got to invest more money in emerging technologies to help keep high-paying jobs here at home.Two and a half decades later, May said:We also value something else: the spirit of citizenship.That spirit that means you respect the bonds and obligations that make our society work. That means a commitment to the men and women who live around you, who work for you, who buy the goods and services you sell. That spirit that means recognizing the social contract that says you train up local young people before you take on cheap labor from overseas. That spirit that means you do as others do, and pay your fair share of tax.Even when speaking before civil rights and women\u2019s rights groups, Obama took pains to avoid particularistic appeals.When any human being is denied a life of dignity and respect, no matter whether they live in Anacostia or Appalachia or a village in Africa; when people are trapped in extreme poverty we know how to curb or suffering from diseases we know how to prevent; when they\u2019re going without the medicines that they so desperately need \u2014 we have more work to do. That\u2019s what this election is all about. It\u2019s about the responsibilities we all share for the future we hold in common.Not black America or white America. Not rich America or poor America, rural America or urban America, but all America. An America where no child\u2019s destiny is determined before she\u2019s born \u2014 and no one\u2019s future is confined to the neighborhood he\u2019s born into. An America where hard work is still a ticket to the middle class \u2014 and you can make it if you try.You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged. While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\u2019s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate. So, you have to wonder: \"When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\u201dThe difference in the rhetorical strategy of Hillary Clinton and Theresa May is one of stress and underscoring. While May made sure her identity group stands were secondary to her pronounced commitment to the working men and women of England generally, Clinton frequently placed her focus on identity groups.Take her speech in Nevada a week before the state\u2019s caucuses in February:\u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow \u2014 and I will, if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will \u2014 would that end racism?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d the audience replied.\u201cWould that end sexism?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWould that end discrimination against the LGBT community?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWould that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants overnight?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dEarlier, at a primary debate on CNN, Anderson Cooper asked her: \u201cSecretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama?\u201dClinton replied:Well, I think that\u2019s pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we\u2019ve had up until this point, including President Obama.Clinton\u2019s comments at the debate and in Nevada were accurate but told voters nothing about how a Clinton presidency would improve their lives in ways that the Obama presidency had not.Donald Trump won the presidency on an identity politics counterpunch: the mobilization of angry white voters, most of them men. White men supported Trump over Hillary Clinton 62 percent to 31 percent, while white women supported Trump by a more modest margin, 52 to 43. Clinton\u2019s emphasis on her gender appears to have helped Trump in key battlegrounds.The approach developed by May and her staff, and by the Obama and Bill Clinton campaigns before her, addresses a question that nags at Democratic strategists: How do you establish a commonweal when everyone is looking to have his or her own concerns ratified?The tried and true way for a politician to market a coalitional regime amid a cacophony of particularistic demands is to forcefully assert the primacy of the whole. This worked for the Obama insurgency in 2008 because his coalition members were willing to temporarily suspend their immediate demands in favor of a more encompassing victory.Looking toward the future, Democrats might turn the tables on the Republicans and explicitly demonize Trump and his party as proponents of an exclusionary politics of white male identity.But it is also legitimate to ask whether the age of identity politics is coming to an end. One lesson of 2016 is that opposition to multiculturalism has become an extraordinarily powerful mobilizing tool for the right. It has spurred the emergence of a white lower- and middle-income Republican party while simultaneously invigorating the formerly insignificant alt-right and white supremacists generally.It would be simplistic to make identity politics the sole culprit of this year\u2019s Democratic defeat, especially in light of Clinton\u2019s 2.4 million popular vote margin. While universalistic appeals have a certain allure in the face of particularistic clamor, it is unlikely that either identity politics or its hyperactive watchdog, political correctness \u2014 the current whipping boys of postelection analysis \u2014 will disappear anytime soon.Earlier, traditional societies imposed clear frameworks and roles upon individuals, but with postindustrial modernization, identity became individualized and pluralized. Individuals became more focused on self-determination and self-expression. An individual\u2019s identity is neither a stable nor a finished entity. Contemporary societies generate possibilities of creating new identities. The last ten years have been dominated by incomplete, ever more fragmented identities composed of multiplied and individualized persons. The world we live in creates new forms and breeds fragmentedness. Pluralization of forms of agency, the many sources of authority an individual can invoke and the chance to choose a lifestyle have become increasingly important in creating an identity.This has been such a profound transformation that now themeaning of the concept of identity is ambivalent and presupposes both a positive identification with other people, groups, collectives, cultures and a negative identification (differentiation) with all a person is not.Identity as a key aspect of human and thus political behavior is a reality. Should the Democrats strive for more subtle, sophisticated and ingenious appeals to their party\u2019s cross-section of identities, including a revivification of the idea of the commonweal? I would say emphatically yes. Trump\u2019s recent victory notwithstanding, the debate over how to do this needs to move forward on a higher plane, without the name calling, if it is to have any chance of success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California, at Forefront of Climate Fight, Won\u2019t Back Down to Trump", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Foreign governments concerned about climate change may soon be spending more time dealing with Sacramento than Washington.But California \u2014 a state that has for 50 years been a leader in environmental advocacy \u2014 is about to step unto the breach. In a show of defiance, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and legislative leaders said they would work directly with other nations and states to defend and strengthen what were already far and away the most aggressive policies to fight climate change in the nation. That includes a legislatively mandated target of reducing carbon emissions in California to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.\u201cCalifornia can make a significant contribution to advancing the cause of dealing with climate change, irrespective of what goes on in Washington,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t underestimate California\u2019s resolve if everything moves in this extreme climate denial direction. Yes, we will take action.\u201dThe environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California\u2019s climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state\u2019s vast research community \u2014 including two national laboratories \u2014 which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards.And some business leaders warned that California\u2019s embrace of environmental regulations \u2014 from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors \u2014 could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations.\u201cIf the other states pursue no-climate-change policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,\u201d said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable.When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders.The bills \u201cimpose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone\u2019s daily lives or the fact that California\u2019s population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,\u201d the California Chamber of Commerce said.The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for commentDemocrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2.5 trillion.\u201cCalifornia more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,\u201d said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. \u201cWe will not deviate from our leadership because of one election.\u201d\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,\u201d said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThis will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science.\u201dMs. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the fossil-fuel industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state\u2019s energy and climate initiatives. \u201cBut they would be fighting a very uphill battle,\u201d she said. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to really slow this train down.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on cap-and-trade policies.Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight.The clean-air initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very energy-efficiency policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California\u2019s economic reversal.\u201cIf the president-elect and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,\u201d Mr. de Leon said. \u201cThey will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G.D.P.\u201dStill, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama.\u201cOur system works better \u2014 our cap-and-trade system and other ways of addressing climate change \u2014 if we have more company,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. \u201cThe more company we have, the better.\u201dDan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can \u201ckeep doing what we are doing, leading the way.\u201d\u201cBut will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,\u201d he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement.Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an anti-Trump environmental movement.\u201cWe\u2019ve got the lawyers and we\u2019ve got the scientists and are ready to fight,\u201d Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to win.\u201dMr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting.\u201cIn a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Flood of Urbanites, a Canadian Hippie Haven Tries to Keep Its Mellow", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byNelson JournalNELSON, British Columbia \u2014 Marijuana, Vietnam War draft dodgers and artists gave Nelson its tree-hugging, bohemian soul.This remote mountain town in British Columbia has recently welcomed a new wave of settlers: urban refugees, increasingly priced out of cities like Vancouver and yearning for a simpler life. They are drawn to a postcard-perfect burg that seems to have it all \u2014 a music academy, two video stores, three record shops, a charcuterie owned by actual French people and a main street unmarred by a Starbucks or fast-food chains.Many of Nelson\u2019s recent transplants fled Canadian cities, where even a couple in cubicle professions can struggle to get by. Others were willing to exchange lucrative salaries for jobs that let them go mountain biking in the afternoon.\u201cNobody moves here to work their butt off,\u201d said Amy Bohigian, 43, a Harvard-educated filmmaker who relocated with her wife to Nelson from Toronto in 2006. To stay, however, they had to adapt to the town\u2019s rather quirky entrepreneurial skill set. \u201cYou may have to sell goat-milk soap at the craft market for the first few years until your massage practice has enough clients,\u201d she said, only half joking.But Nelson\u2019s charms have become something of a curse. The recent influx of people to this compact town of 10,000 has led to an affordable housing crisis, set off by bidding wars over its scarce housing stock and a zero percent rental vacancy rate caused in part by homeowners who rent their properties to tourists through sites like Airbnb.Nelson\u2019s housing crisis echoes a wider problem in booming British Columbia, where tight real estate markets, diminished government support for affordable housing and rising inflation have spawned a vacancy rate of 1.3 percent, and made rentals virtually impossible to find in Vancouver, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.But Nelson is no metropolis. Founded during a silver rush in 1897, the town is wedged between a lake and the steep slopes of the Selkirk Mountains, some 400 miles east of Vancouver by road. Around a century ago, a sect of Christian Pacifists from Russia, known as the Dukhobors, settled nearby, infusing the region with antiwar zeal. During the Vietnam War, Nelson became a haven for young Americans fleeing the draft, many of whom were spirited across the border by members of a local Quaker community.In the 1970s, Nelson and the surrounding Slocan Valley were abundant with draft dodgers, hippie communes and \u201cthe best weed in the world,\u201d said Mike Hames, 68, a Canadian carpenter whose zany, self-built house, resembling \u201ca boat on a mushroom trip,\u201d is a local landmark.Nelson lost its sawmill and university a decade later, forcing the struggling town to reinvent itself through tourism and entrepreneurship. \u201cMarijuana was definitely how people made money,\u201d said Deb Kozak, the mayor.Nelson\u2019s liberal tolerance played a major role in making it a regional hub for social service providers. But they have been overwhelmed by a swelling population and rising poverty. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm of big-city issues,\u201d said Jenny Robinson, executive director of the Nelson Cares Society, which runs the town\u2019s 17-bed homeless shelter and provides services to low-income residents.The group has received funding and donations to maintain and build some new accommodations, she said, but not enough to solve the town\u2019s extreme housing crunch. \u201cIn the last 18 months it\u2019s just gone crazy,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.Janet Mulloy and her twin, Judy, both artists, were free spirits when they moved to Nelson in 1984. Until a decade ago, Judy said, they were able to afford an apartment for under $800 a month, scraped together from their small jewelry business, odd jobs and public assistance. But Nelson\u2019s housing crisis pushed them into homelessness this year.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve lived apart in over 20 years,\u201d said Janet, 51, who had been sleeping in the shelter for a month while her sister moved in with a friend. The misery of homelessness has compounded a sense that the Nelson they once knew was disappearing. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic cleansing of this town we helped create,\u201d Judy said with a sigh.Baker Street, Nelson\u2019s main drag, is a testament to the tensions roiling the community. On a recent afternoon, a gray-ponytailed busker stood strumming a Tom Petty tune in front of a cafe that sells organic coffee. Beggars with swollen hands suggesting heroin addiction panhandled outside a boutique selling hemp yoga pants, beeswax candles and posters explaining \u201cHow to Be an Ally to Indigenous Peoples.\u201dBalancing Nelson\u2019s economic future and cultural heritage is complicated by the town\u2019s cramped mountainside locale. \u201cGeographically we can\u2019t do sprawl,\u201d Mayor Kozak said. Still, she said that Nelson was working to develop a \u201cfull spectrum\u201d of housing to ease the crisis, while trying to address the concerns of residents worried that new development will ruin their counterculture paradise.The community once thwarted the construction of a Walmart superstore, but officials have since installed broadband internet and hope to approve a tech innovation center, part of a plan to stem rural brain drain.New arrivals are not complaining. Adam Thomas, 42, who moved to Nelson in July with his family after selling their Vancouver home, said that even dual incomes there were no longer enough to keep them out of debt.\u201cWe felt trapped in Vancouver,\u201d he said, seated by the fire in the three-bedroom house they purchased for $250,000. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky. I feel like I\u2019ve got to earn the right to be here.\u201dHis wife found an office job and he dived into the town\u2019s communal economy, teaching at the local college and working at the co-op radio station.On Take Your Daughter to Work Day, Mr. Thomas took his daughter to his shift at Reo\u2019s Video store, a bustling rental throwback bought and expanded this year by another Vancouver transplant. It is stocked with about 15,000 films, a foreign section and every Academy Award best picture winner.\u201cIt\u2019s like living in the 1990s,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

We\u2019ll share some of them on a future episode of the Book Review\u2019s podcast.Siddhartha Deb:At year\u2019s end, I\u2019m remembering Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cBlood Meridian.\u201d Unflinching in its portrayal of settler colonialism and so familiar in its violence, racism and twisted masculinity, it is most memorable for me in its portrait of Judge Holden, the Devil incarnate, perched on a rock and waiting for us to pass by.Siddhartha Deb\u2019s most recent book is \u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned: A Portrait of the New India.\u201dRivka Galchen:The Italian writer Natalia Ginzburg lived through the rise of fascism, which left her widowed with three small children. Among my favorite of her works translated by Lynne Sharon Schwartz and collected in \u201cA Place to Live: Selected Essays of Natalia Ginzburg\u201d are \u201cWinter in the Abruzzi\u201d and \u201cThe Baby Who Saw Bears.\u201dRivka Galchen\u2019s most recent book is \u201cLittle Labors.\u201dAlice Gregory:Rebecca Solnit\u2019s \u201cRiver of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West\u201d is the most impressive book I read this year or maybe any year. It somehow manages to deploy the most specific and peculiar facts while telling a story that\u2019s about everything \u2014 art, politics, history, science, philosophy. It blows my mind that one person wrote it.Alice Gregory is a contributing editor at T: The New York Times Style Magazine.Zo\u00eb Heller:I really enjoyed Emma Cline\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Girls.\u201d Cline writes lovely, noticing sentences, and her story about the charismatic power of an evil cult leader turned out to be a not altogether inappropriate fable for 2016.Zo\u00eb Heller is the author of \u201cEverything You Know,\u201d \u201cNotes on a Scandal\u201d and \u201cThe Believers.\u201dAnna Holmes:Colson Whitehead\u2019s slave-narrative novel, \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d: a defiant, gorgeous triumph of human imagination and empathy that can be interpreted as a commentary on the past, a reckoning with the present or a provocation of the future. (It\u2019s probably all three.)Anna Holmes is an editorial executive at First Look Media and the editor of two books, including \u201cThe Book of Jezebel.\u201dLeslie Jamison:This year I reread Michelle Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d a necessary account of the systemic racism embedded in our justice system. Alexander\u2019s book feels more vital now than ever. It\u2019s a protest against the persecution that has persistently operated under alibis of security and justice \u2014 a protest we need to keep making as powerfully as we can.Leslie Jamison is the author of \u201cThe Empathy Exams.\u201dAdam Kirsch:\u201cMoonglow,\u201d Michael Chabon\u2019s new novel, is my favorite of his books and one of the most memorable novels I read this year. Using autobiography as a launchpad and then taking off for the moon, Chabon offers a funny, moving and dramatic tribute to his grandparents and their American generation.Adam Kirsch is a poet, critic and columnist for Tablet magazine.Thomas Mallon:In \u201cThe Dream Life of Astronauts,\u201d Patrick Ryan flies further into a little fictional empyrean he\u2019s made all his own. Peopled by kookily sad denizens of Florida\u2019s Space Coast, whose dreams rarely achieve liftoff without crashing and burning, Ryan\u2019s stories are filled with a wan tenderness and a spectacular lack of condescension.Thomas Mallon\u2019s most recent book is \u201cFinale: A Novel of the Reagan Years.\u201d Ayana Mathis:\u201cThe Plague of Doves\u201d takes as its subject the residents of a North Dakota town abutting an Ojibwe reservation. The novel is a kaleidoscope of voices, imagery and memories. Louise Erdrich\u2019s prose evokes the tumult of lived experience and ancestral trauma. She reminds us we are all yearning creatures, subject to forces set in motion long before we were born.Ayana Mathis is the author of \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie.\u201dCharles McGrath:\u201cCaught,\u201d by Henry Green. First published in 1943 and now reissued in the New York Review Classics series, \u201cCaught\u201d manages the improbable feat of being both a harrowing war story of London during the Blitz and a sharply observed comedy about social class. Green was a silver-spoon aristocrat, but his ear for common speech was as keen as Dickens\u2019s.Charles McGrath was the editor of the Book Review from 1995 to 2004.Pankaj Mishra:David Kennedy\u2019s \u201cA World of Struggle: How Power, Law, and Expertise Shape Global Political Economy\u201d describes our world more accurately than any book I have read this year. Kennedy offers no clear prescriptions. Yet he clarifies that understanding how this world of injustice and inequality came about is the essential first step toward a democratic alternative.Pankaj Mishra\u2019s next book, \u201cAge of Anger,\u201d will be published in February.Benjamin Moser:In \u201cThe Fall Of Language in the Age of English,\u201d Minae Mizumura shows, better than anyone ever has, how English is wrecking other languages \u2014 reducing even great literary languages, including Japanese and French, to local dialects \u2014 and makes a vigorous case for the superiority of the written over the spoken word.Benjamin Moser is the author of \u201cWhy This World: A Biography of Clarice Lispector.\u201dJames Parker:How I wish I\u2019d written Max Porter\u2019s ugly-beautiful post-Ted Hughes polyphonic spree of a novel \u201cGrief Is the Thing With Feathers\u201d; I listened to an interview with the author and could barely hear his (cultured, friendly) voice through the electrical envy-storm that was writhing in purple bands across my forebrain.James Parker is a contributing editor at The Atlantic.Francine Prose:\u201cPedro P\u00e1ramo,\u201d \u2014 Juan Rulfo\u2019s 1955 masterpiece \u2014 packs the scope and sweep of an epic into just over 120 pages. It has the beauty of a lyric poem and manages the dazzling magic trick of blurring the line between life and death. Set in a rural Mexican ghost town, Rulfo\u2019s book shows us how seamlessly fiction can combine the regional and the universal.Francine Prose\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cMister Monkey.\u201dLiesl Schillinger:In July, during the national conventions, I read a stunning debut that resurrects the violence and anger of the 1968 Chicago riots, carrying it forward into the present day through the story of two Midwesterners addicted to virtual-reality games. It\u2019s \u201cThe Nix,\u201d by Nathan Hill, the first book I\u2019ve read in two decades that earns the title Great American Novel.Liesl Schillinger is a critic and translator and the author of \u201cWordbirds.\u201dDana Stevens:I read Rebecca Solnit\u2019s \u201cA Field Guide to Getting Lost\u201d under ideal conditions: alone in a strange city, at bus stops and in public parks, surrounded by families speaking foreign yet familiar languages.

{"Headline": "A New Wave of Popular Fury Could Hit Europe in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 For Europe, 2016 has brought a series of political shocks: near-record numbers of immigrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa; a vote by Britain to leave the European Union and renewed threats by Russia to meddle on the continent.But 2017 could be even bumpier. There will be at least three elections in Europe next year: in Germany, France and the Netherlands for sure, and now perhaps in Italy, too. Just about everywhere, political establishments are being blamed for tepid growth, for too few jobs and for favoring global financial markets over the common citizen.Coming after Britain\u2019s vote this year to leave the European Union, the Italian outcome was taken as yet another rebuke to decades of efforts to forge a closer union of the bloc\u2019s 28 countries. And it raised new doubts about whether that union would hold in the years ahead.\u201cThis is a crisis that strikes at the absolute core of the European Union in a way even \u2018Brexit\u2019 does not,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\u201cThe U.K. was always one foot in and one foot out,\u201d he said. \u201cItaly is a founding member state, fully integrated into the union\u2019s political and economic structure. This is existential for the E.U.\u201dThe Italian electorate rejected a constitutional overhaul that, among other changes, would have increased the power of the prime minister by reducing the number of senators and decreasing their power. The political impact of the rejection lies less in any direct effect on policies than in the opening it provides for the populist Five Star movement, which campaigned against the constitutional changes. It also brought the resignation of Mr. Renzi, a strong supporter of the European Union who was working hard to stabilize some of Italy\u2019s shakiest banks.The popular anger has turned what are normally routine elections into what Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a former French defense official and the chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, described as moments of \u201cvolatility and inscrutability.\u201dHow leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.That is especially so with yes-or-no referendums \u2014 first in Britain, now in Italy \u2014 where a populist rejection of the political establishment can, by extension, also be a chance to send a message to the unelected officials in Brussels who work closely with European government leaders.In that context, Mr. Heisbourg said, the anti-European Union sentiment \u201cis just a handle for the sense of a loss of control, a loss of agency\u201d that people feel.\u201cIn Britain, one of the campaign slogans for Brexit was \u2018Vote Leave, Take Control,\u2019\u201d he noted. \u201cThe idea was the E.U. was preventing Britons from doing that. The E.U. is the pi\u00f1ata for populism.\u201dThe motivation for voters in Britain and Italy was much the same as that for American voters who backed Donald J. Trump: to drive home to the elite that the status quo was unacceptable.Compounding the frustration on both continents, and especially in Europe, are the lingering effects of the global recession of 2008, from which many European countries never fully recovered.\u201cThe social contract that we, the West, signed up to \u2014 Europe, the United States \u2014 no longer adds up,\u201d for people, said Xenia Wickett, who oversees the United States and the Americas program for the research institution Chatham House.\u201cThe population is aging, we have far more older people relying on the younger ones for support, productivity is slowing, we haven\u2019t been investing in our infrastructure and education,\u201d Ms. Wickett said. \u201cYou have the disenfranchised saying, \u2018That doesn\u2019t work for us.\u2019\u201dIn France, for example, economic growth barely reached 1 percent last year. Youth unemployment there still hovers near 25 percent. (In Italy, Spain and Greece, it is even higher.) Older and less educated workers feel overwhelmed by an economy that seems to have left them behind.\u201cThe Rust Belt isn\u2019t just in America \u2014 there\u2019s a Rust Belt in the north of France,\u201d said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund. \u201cThey feel they are the dispossessed, dispossessed of their country\u2019s sovereignty and of their economy.\u201dFar from easing those anxieties, membership in the European Union is blamed for exacerbating them. And the austerity regime that Brussels officials and international lenders have demanded, especially across southern Europe, has fueled anger still more.The Italian vote will probably widen the gulf between the northern eurozone countries, led by Germany, and those in the south, said Pawel Tokarski, a senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.Many in Germany and other northern countries, he said, will take the vote as a sign of unwillingness in Italy to overhaul its economy the way Brussels wants.\u201cDefinitely, this vote is going to strengthen the anti-E.U. voices,\u201d Mr. Tokarski said.Those voices have been building for more than 25 years, as the union expanded, the Brussels bureaucracy grew and many people began to feel that the union\u2019s regulations and requirements were more trouble than they were worth.Tensions were apparent as early as 1992, when the Maastricht treaty, which was meant to bring Europe closer together, barely won approval in Denmark and France.Today, anti-European Union positions are part of the platform of almost every populist party, including Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France; Geert Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom in the Netherlands; and the Five Star Movement in Italy, led by Beppe Grillo.The political demise of Mr. Renzi, the Italian prime minister, and his reform agenda removes an unabashedly pro-European leader who had hoped to ignite economic growth by ending an era of crippling budget austerity. Instead, he may be remembered for creating an opening for politicians who are openly hostile to Europe and the euro.\u201cThe way Washington is perceived by many American people is the way many French or Germans or Italians perceive Brussels,\u201d Ms. de Hoop Scheffer said. \u201cThey perceive Brussels as almost an illegitimate entity.\u201dThe old center-right and center-left parties that divided power in a number of countries and kept Europe stable for decades are being swept aside by new and unpredictable forces nearly across the board. Politicians who play on nationalism and worries about economic disenfranchisement are on the rise. Animosity toward the European Union is of a piece with this feeling.\u201cRight versus left doesn\u2019t exist any more,\u201d Mr. Wilders, who is regularly rated as the most popular politician in the Netherlands, said in an interview.Many voters on both sides of the Atlantic seem fed up with the old political names and faces, like Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush in the United States.In France, the list includes the former president Nicolas Sarkozy and another center-right figure, Alain Jupp\u00e9, who are both out of the 2017 presidential race, as well as the current Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who decided not to seek a second term because his approval ratings were so poor.With so many major elections on the way and so few of the big questions settled, Europe seems destined to continue to be subject to political tremors \u2014 and vulnerable to stronger forces that risk fracturing the European Union altogether.\u201cWhat we want is to bring back the values, the identity, the culture and the money, and put forward again national interests,\u201d Mr. Wilders said.Whether such changes are possible is hard to know, but Europe\u2019s populists would clearly like to project an air of inevitability.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the genie will not go back into the bottle,\u201d Mr. Wilders said. \u201cThe process will continue, and will change Europe forever.\u201dPeter S. Goodman contributed reporting from London, Alison Smale from Vienna and Milan Schreuer from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Faster Growth? Two Things Trump Supporters Won\u2019t Like", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byEconomic PolicyBut the closer you look at the math of economic growth, the more you see the inherent contradictions in trying to make that happen. The two strategies that would most directly help achieve that goal clash with other planks of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda.Economic growth can happen two ways: More hours are worked, or more economic output is generated from each hour of labor.But if the economy quickly became more productive, it would, at least in the short run, also risk the livelihoods of some of the very working-class people whom Mr. Trump pledges to help. And the surest way to increase the number of hours worked is to allow more immigration, which would be directly at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s get-tough stance on that topic.In other words, if an era of faster growth is really going to arrive, it will probably involve some changes that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters very much don\u2019t want to happen.But the connection between productivity gains and higher incomes can take time to play out. Often it means short-term disruption \u2014 job loss \u2014 for workers whose jobs are rendered unnecessary.These advances have made the United States richer \u2014 with jobs like designing software systems and taking medical images. But that\u2019s not much solace for former manufacturing workers who haven\u2019t found lucrative or rewarding work in growing fields, a group that is at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign appeals.It\u2019s not just manufacturing. Consider one innovation that could plausibly become a reality in the years ahead: trucks that drive themselves. Over time, that will make the United States economy more productive and raise incomes.But it would be daunting for any of those drivers who can\u2019t find a job with similar pay, especially during some lag period. The experience with manufacturing does not give much reason for optimism that less-educated workers will have success finding lucrative jobs after a productivity-enhancing innovation the way economics textbooks might predict.It\u2019s possible that the next wave of productivity gains could come from industries that affect white-collar professionals more than the blue-collar workers who form the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition. Think of artificial intelligence software that could one day replace doctors in diagnosing diseases (or at least make them able to serve more patients at once).If that happens, the question will be whether those displaced workers can adapt any better than the steelworkers of 30 years ago \u2014 and if not, how to deal with masses of white-collar workers who are as disconnected from the modern economy as their blue-collar counterparts seem to be.More people can make more stuff. That is the simple, brutal math behind G.D.P., and it\u2019s the other central challenge of reconciling Mr. Trump\u2019s economic growth ambitions with his other policy priorities. By extension, the more people there are in the United States with the desire to work, the higher the nation\u2019s economic output will be.One major factor in the sluggish growth of the last few years is that the United States labor force isn\u2019t growing the way it used to. The peak of the baby boom is nearing retirement age. And unlike in the second half of the 20th century, the proportion of women who work is stable, not rising.A straightforward way of increasing the labor force would be to increase the number of immigrants, especially those with advanced skills, whose economic output is the highest.Here\u2019s some fun with labor force math. There are about one million legal immigrants per year. If you doubled the rate of legal immigration and ensured that 75 percent of those extra million people would join the labor force, it would mean a boost to the labor force of 750,000 people per year over current levels.The Congressional Budget Office currently projects that the labor force will grow by 0.5 percent a year over the coming decade. But if you add in those extra people under this hypothetical, that rate would rise to 1 percent.It would put a president a good bit closer to achieving an ambitious economic growth goal, all else being equal.Of course, Mr. Trump has made hostility to immigration a hallmark of his campaign, and there seems to be little appetite for any major expansions of immigration in Congress or in public opinion, let alone a doubling.Mr. Trump has argued that there is a vast untapped pool of American workers who are not in the labor force at all, and there is truth to that. But the pool may not be as large \u2014 or have as much potential to improve growth \u2014 as he suggests.In other words, unless Mr. Trump wants to entertain immigration policies that are contrary to his campaign messages, demographics will be a major headwind making his growth promises all but impossible to achieve.Perhaps there is a broader lesson in all of this. Life is full of trade-offs. And so is economic policy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Obama Economy Has Unfinished Business", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsYou can be forgiven if it\u2019s hard to remember just how dark the economic future looked exactly eight years ago. The mind, after all, has a way of blocking out memories of trauma.December 2008 was a month in which employers in the United States eliminated 695,000 jobs; the unemployment rate rose by half a percentage point on the way toward double digits; and entire industries, notably banks and the automobile sector, stood on the brink of collapse and were saved only through billions in federal bailouts.But if you read carefully, you can also find in this 599-page document a road map to what has gone wrong in the Obama economy: where progress toward higher standards of living has been fleeting, or nonexistent, or has gone in reverse.In particular, a section that begins on Page 57 lays out \u201cfour continued structural challenges\u201d that can be read as, in effect, the unfinished business that the president will turn over to his successor.Simply as a mechanical matter, this is a big part of the reason that overall economic growth has been slow. Over time, it implies that economic well-being will increase more slowly.That said, there are a range of theories around why this has happened and what, if any, policy tools might fix it.One possibility is that the march of technological progress has slowed, and that government has few tools that might help. Another possibility is that the recession and slow recovery have created a self-reinforcing dearth of investment, and that government policy to increase overall demand in the economy could also trigger more productivity-enhancing investments.Finally, many conservatives argue that excessive regulation is the culprit, and that loosening a range of restrictions will unleash more innovation and investment by businesses.If Hillary Clinton had won the election, this approach to thinking about inequality would most likely have formed a central role in her economic agenda.The council notes that part of that is a result of people hitting retirement age, but also that there has been an enormous decline in the percentage of prime-age men working, which goes back decades. In 1953, 3 percent of 25-to-54 year-old men were neither working nor looking for work; that\u2019s now 12 percent.The Obama administration argues that the way to bring people back into the labor market is to strengthen the \u201cconnective tissue\u201d in how the job market works, for example by modernizing the unemployment insurance system; raising the minimum wage and expanding tax credits for low-income work; and increasing access to paid leave and child care.Donald J. Trump made low labor force participation a hallmark of his campaign for the presidency, but proposes different strategies to solving it; he emphasizes a pro-manufacturing trade policy and infrastructure spending that might offer opportunities for the prime-age men who have left the labor force.The White House is essentially arguing that there is a great deal of work to be done to make the United States economy more resilient when the next downturn hits. One step would be to change laws so that \u201cautomatic stabilizers\u201d like unemployment insurance can expand automatically during downturns, essentially baking into the system some automatic fiscal stimulus.The economists argue that more work to reduce the growth of health care cost could improve the prospects for the economy over the longer term, and that reducing carbon emissions is essential for long-term economic sustainability.One thing the report doesn\u2019t quite say, but which fits in the theme of sustainability, is that the nature of this expansion \u2014 heavily reliant on a loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve \u2014 has left the United States particularly vulnerable should a new downturn arise. Indeed, many of the more pessimistic scenarios for the economy involve a recession that happens because the central bank doesn\u2019t have the usual tools available to combat a minor shock.There\u2019s no doubt that the United States economy is on better footing than it was when Mr. Obama took office \u2014 but that\u2019s also a little misleading, like comparing the health of a patient a month after a catastrophic car wreck with eight years later.Mr. Trump, in other words, will inherit a patient whose short-term trauma has been fixed \u2014 but who has quite a few long-lingering problems still to be addressed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin Won\u2019t Expel U.S. Diplomats as Russian Foreign Minister Urged", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced Friday that he would not retaliate against President Obama\u2019s decision to expel Russian diplomats and impose new sanctions \u2014 only hours after his foreign minister recommended doing just that.Mr. Putin, betting on improved relations with the next American president, said he would not eject 35 diplomats or close any diplomatic facilities, rejecting a tit-for-tat response to the actions taken on Thursday by the Obama administration.Mr. Putin even said he did not want to close a wooded picnic area on a Moscow River island used by diplomats because he did not want to deprive their children. Then he went one step further, inviting all children of American diplomats accredited in Russia to celebrate the New Year and the Russian Orthodox Christmas with him at the Kremlin.President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for trying to influence the 2016 election through cyberattacks. Here\u2019s what led to the sanctions.\u201cPutin showed that he is above his own officials, that he doesn\u2019t want to take the retaliatory action suggested by his foreign minister,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, an international relations analyst and columnist. \u201cThis is an attempt to show that he is a figure not just of worldly scale, but of planetary.\u201dShould Mr. Putin have chosen to retaliate harshly against the United States, he would most likely have deepened the rift between the two countries and left President-elect Trump with a nettlesome diplomatic standoff from the moment he arrived in the Oval Office.But by choosing essentially to disregard Mr. Obama\u2019s punitive measures, Mr. Putin can try to disarm his American critics, including members of Congress who consider him an aggressive foe of the United States. That could give Mr. Trump more room to pursue the closer cooperation with Russia that he has advocated.Despite all of the statements from senior officials about the need to respect \u201creciprocity,\u201d Mr. Putin essentially warned Washington that he was waiting for the Trump administration \u2014 a tactic not unlike the one adopted by Israel in its recent rejection of a peace plan laid out by Secretary of State John Kerry.\u201cMoscow wanted Trump to have room to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Frolov added. \u201cThis decision is a clear gesture of good will toward him.\u201dMr. Putin called it \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the Obama administration chose to end its relationship with Russia in such a way, but he sent a New Year\u2019s greetings to Mr. Obama, his family, Mr. Trump and \u201call the American people.\u201dJust hours earlier, Mr. Lavrov had recommended that 31 American diplomats be expelled from Moscow and four from St. Petersburg. He also recommended the closing of two facilities: the picnic area used by diplomats, as well as a warehouse in the southern, industrial part of the Russian capital.\u201cOf course, we cannot leave such mischievous tricks without a response,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said. \u201cReciprocity is the law of diplomacy and of international relations.\u201dHow U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.The actions amounted to the strongest American response yet to a state-sponsored cyberattack.In addition to giving the Russian diplomats and their families 72 hours to leave the country, the measures announced by Mr. Obama imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s two main intelligence services. Washington described the diplomats as intelligence agents working under the cover of diplomacy.Russia announced it would send a special plane to collect the diplomats and their families by the Jan. 1 deadline.The economic sanctions covered three main areas, including blocking Russian access to international credit, cutting off cooperation in advanced oil field technology and stopping arms deals or the sale of dual-use technology.Much of their effect stemmed from the fact that they coincided with a sharp drop in global oil prices, hitting Russia with a double blow. Companies had trouble obtaining credit, driving up the short-term cost of borrowing and compounding a deep recession. Over the long run, the effect is likely to be strongest in the oil sector because it dried up most exploration in difficult areas like the Arctic.Russia responded with sanctions of its own, mostly banning agricultural products and certain foods imported from the West. Mr. Putin and other officials have repeatedly crowed that this resulted in a successful campaign of \u201cimport substitution.\u201dRussia also maintained a secret list of Western officials who were no longer allowed into the country. Most, like the former American ambassador Michael McFaul, discovered it only when they applied for visas to Russia.Before Mr. Lavrov spoke, Maria Zakharova, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, took to Facebook to denounce the Obama administration.Ms. Zakharova called the administration \u201ca group of a foreign-policy losers, embittered and narrow-minded.\u201d\u201cToday, America, the American people, were humiliated by their own president,\u201d she wrote.There is a long history of reciprocal expulsions and other measures between the United States and Russia, even after the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.While Mr. Obama framed the new American measures as a response to Russian hacking during the election, the expulsion of Russian diplomats from Washington and San Francisco was described as a response to continued harassment of American diplomats in Russia.Embassy employees said they were followed as they moved around the city, and that sometimes, when they were not at home, agents would enter and move the furniture around, just to show that they had been there.Some find it unnerving, while others shrug it off as part of the job. One young father said he was just grateful that his children were too small to realize that the family was being followed.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big Banks Are Putting Rain Forests in Peril", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Global lenders, sometimes flouting their own policies, have financed projects in Indonesia and elsewhere that destroy ecosystems and contribute to climate change.Supported byIn early 2015, scientists monitoring satellite images at Global Forest Watch raised the alarm about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia.Environmental groups raced to the scene in West Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, to find a charred wasteland: smoldering fires, orangutans driven from their nests, and signs of an extensive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\u201cThere was pretty much no forest left,\u201d said Karmele Llano S\u00e1nchez, director of the nonprofit International Animal Rescue\u2019s orangutan rescue group, which set out to save the endangered primates. \u201cAll the forest had burned.\u201dThe year before the clearing of trees in West Kalimantan, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured $235 million in loans \u2014 funds that the Indonesian company used to buy out a partner and bolster its landholdings \u2014 from banks including Credit Suisse and Bank of America, according to an examination of lending data by The New York Times.That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public. It also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia, or financing provided to other, more global players. And it contrasts with efforts by companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble to distance themselves from suppliers linked to deforestation.\u201cDestroying the world\u2019s forests makes fighting climate change almost impossible,\u201d said Andrew W. Mitchell, executive director of the Global Canopy Programme, a forestry think tank. \u201cThe finance sector is really lagging behind in realizing that.\u201dThe 2014 deal financed Rajawali\u2019s expansion into palm oil by helping the conglomerate buy out a former partner, invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. Demand for palm oil is surging worldwide, driven by rising incomes in markets like China and India and a switch away from trans fats by Americans and Europeans.Rajawali\u2019s plantations have been accused by environmental and labor groups of deforestation and illegal burning. Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s biggest palm oil producers, and forestry loss there and elsewhere ranks as one of the biggest single contributors to global warming.Sebastian Sharp, a spokesman for Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm, acknowledged that the burning and clearing on its West Kalimantan forest sites might be illegal but said local communities encroaching on its properties and starting the fires were to blame. He said the company did not engage in illegal burning or clearing.Credit Suisse declined to comment on its Rajawali deal or to say whether the deal violated its sustainability policies. A Bank of America spokesman, Bill Halldin, said that the most serious accusations against Rajawali came after the 2014 loan, in which the bank played \u201ca very small role.\u201d\u201cToday, we would certainly consider more information before making any decision on any client,\u201d he said.Brigitte Seegers, a spokeswoman for ABN Amro, declined to comment.Climate concerns have been brought into sharp relief by the impending presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.Rajawali originally operated its palm plantation business, Green Eagle Holdings, as a joint venture with the French conglomerate Louis Dreyfus. But starting in 2014, Rajawali took the first step to consolidate the palm oil business under its control, and invest in new infrastructure.Its loans from Western banks were crucial. In January 2014, Green Eagle attracted a $120 million loan from a group of lenders led by ABN Amro. In July of that year, it scored an even bigger loan of $235 million from a syndicate led by Credit Suisse. Bank of America also took part in that loan.The banks issued those loans as Rajawali was being accused of extensive forest and peatland destruction, illegal burning, use of child labor and the use of force against workers at plantations under its control.Land-cover mapping by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and satellite imagery from Global Forest Watch, show forest loss at two sites in West Kalimantan from 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, with much of the forest gone by the end of the year. Those sites included around 11,000 hectares of peat, which, when set alight, can smolder for months underground.Zamzami, who goes by one name, a Greenpeace staff member in Indonesia who visited a Rajawali plantation in West Kalimantan in September 2015, said the burning continued. \u201cIt was difficult to breathe because of the smoke,\u201d he said in field notes. \u201cFar away, on the horizon, I could see the forest wall.\u201dEagle High is now one of Indonesia\u2019s largest palm oil plantation operators, with more than a million acres in land rights under its control, according to an investors\u2019 presentation dated September 2014.In December 2015, a 22-year-old worker was shot dead at the plantation by state security forces. It was unclear why state forces were on private property.Mr. Sharp, the Eagle High spokesman, blamed local villagers for the forest clearing and burning on its sites. \u201cIt\u2019s being done by local communities, and we have no control over that,\u201d he said. Environmental groups argue that plantation companies are responsible for protecting their sites.Mr. Sharp said that there were instances in which workers brought their children to plantations but that the company was \u201ctrying to brainstorm ways in which we can stop them from doing that.\u201dHe also questioned the wisdom of Indonesian labor law. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we hire children at 15? Families need income,\u201d he said. Under the country\u2019s law, the minimum age for hazardous work, including jobs on plantations, is 18.The worker who was killed, Marvel Doga, was \u201cdrunk and violent, poured petrol everywhere and threatened to set fire, and he had with him a bow and arrow\u201d when nearby state security forces tried to incapacitate him, leading to his death, Mr. Sharp said. He said Eagle High paid \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to his family in compensation.Credit Suisse and ABN Amro declined to discuss specific deals. Bank of America declined to comment on the accusations.But in a February 2015 research note, Credit Suisse deemed Rajawali\u2019s palm oil push a success. Eagle High\u2019s increased landholdings and land rights signaled \u201csignificant headroom for expansion\u201d of palm oil production, Priscilla Tjitra, an equity analyst for the bank, said in a report to clients.\u201cThe allocation of finance is so influential in our economy and to our environment,\u201d said Tom Picken of the Rainforest Action Network. \u201cBut there\u2019s little way we can hold financial sectors to account.\u201dInternational Animal Rescue, which runs a temporary shelter for about 100 orangutans in West Kalimantan, said its staff had rescued roughly 50 of the primates during the 2015 burning season, twice the number the organization rescues in an average year.\u201cThey were all starving, all skinny,\u201d said Ms. S\u00e1nchez, the orangutan rescue group\u2019s director. So far this year, about 25 orangutans have been rehabilitated.\u201cThe problem is that every time an area is destroyed and orangutans are under real threat, we have to look for areas to release them, and that\u2019s challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of places where we can release these orangutans.\u201dIn September, Rajawali\u2019s plantation arm secured a $192 million loan from Bank Negara Indonesia, a state bank, to refinance the debt held by its plantation subsidiaries and to double the capacity of palm oil refineries in Papua and West Kalimantan.Bank Negara Indonesia\u2019s sustainability policies say that its clients must adopt \u201cminimum environmental, social and governance standards.\u201d The bank did not respond to requests for comment.An article last Sunday about some financing by global lenders for projects that contribute to climate change misstated the number of countries involved in the Paris accord on planet-warming carbon emissions. It is 195, not 95.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Presidency in Play, Can France Embrace Economic Change?", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byHis brash talk has raised concerns about a radical shift from French traditions, while reviving a perennial question: Can France actually be reformed?\u201cThe short answer is yes, but not so ambitiously,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \u201cThe French love economic reform in theory. They hate it in practice once they understand what it means.\u201dWhile the French economy has become more open and competitive in recent decades, resistance breaks out almost anytime the government tries to reshape France\u2019s way of life, especially the vaunted social model, designed to protect citizens from the ravages of the free market. When the focus is on whittling hard-fought human and worker rights \u2014 a concept whose roots reach back to the French Revolution \u2014 tensions can boil over.If elected in May, Mr. Fillon will probably face a similar showdown as he seeks government cuts and deeper labor overhauls while the economy is weak. \u201cFrance\u2019s social model is broken,\u201d he said on the campaign trail. \u201cSometimes you just need to pull the house down and rebuild it.\u201dHis most bitter medicine involves shrinking a government that accounts for more than half of the country\u2019s economy, by cutting 500,000 Civil Service jobs and slashing 100 billion euros in spending over five years. To enhance competitiveness, he wants to weaken labor union power, kill the infamous 35-hour workweek, cut corporate taxes and distill France\u2019s 3,400-page labor code to 150 pages.Much of that will not be easy to carry out. Mr. Fillon will face opposition on austerity from Socialist and National Front lawmakers in Parliament. Heightened security after the terrorist attacks in France will add pressure not to include police and hospital workers in Civil Service reductions. And his ambitious plans for helping businesses are likely to bring unions and workers back out into the streets.\u201cAt the smallest sign of change, there\u2019s protest,\u201d said Philippe Plantier, the founder of Travaux Grande Hauteur, a midsize industrial cleaning company near Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. He is one of thousands of businessmen across France who hope that Mr. Fillon, if elected, will stand firm in the face of almost certain strike action.\u201cAs an employer, anything that will streamline the labor code and get rid of the 35 hours would help create jobs,\u201d Mr. Plantier said. \u201cWe need to liberate this economy, Anglo-Saxon style, if France is to be competitive.\u201dIn the sluggish economy, his orders fell this summer for cleaning big industrial structures, like bridges and cement factories. Mr. Plantier moved to lay off several of his more than 50 employees to adjust for declining income.But the workers sued to block the layoffs and sought more than \u20ac100,000 in damages. \u201cWhen you hire someone in France, it\u2019s for life,\u201d he said.French politicians, and the French people, agree that the economy needs repairing.Since France emerged from a recession in 2010 after Europe\u2019s debt crisis, growth has languished below 2 percent annually. Unemployment is stuck around 10 percent, more than twice the rate in Germany. Nearly a quarter of young people are without work, and many of the new jobs being created are on precarious temporary contracts.France is, of course, still a rich country. It has the second-largest economy in the eurozone behind Germany\u2019s, scores of world-class multinational companies and a stream of international investment. Yet there remains a heated debate about how to improve growth.The Socialist party now in power did little to invigorate the economy. It is divided and weak, and will be in more disarray with Mr. Hollande\u2019s resignation. Other possible contenders on the left include Emmanuel Macron, a young, reformist former economy minister, who wants what he calls an \u201cUber-ization\u201d of the economy to stoke innovation, an idea that would also dilute worker security.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s program is more populist, keeping the retirement age at 60, enhancing labor protections and raising the minimum wage. She would spurn international trade deals, and promises a national referendum on \u201cFrexit,\u201d a reference to a French exit from the European Union, after Britain\u2019s departure vote this summer.Economists say those plans are unsustainable. But Ms. Le Pen is betting that voters are more worried by Mr. Fillon\u2019s Thatcheresque vision for the country. And the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States has given a lift to populists like Ms. Le Pen.\u201cPeople are going to realize that he wants to fire 500,000 civil servants, scrap the 35-hour workweek, cut social security and raise the sales tax,\u201d Florian Philippot, vice president of the National Front, said of Mr. Fillon. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201dWhile Mrs. Thatcher also tackled labor rules to reshape Britain, many in France don\u2019t buy the argument that companies will hire more if they are allowed to fire more. On this issue, France\u2019s labor unions are able to rally support.Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of the hard-line General Confederation of Labor, which spearheaded the nationwide strikes this year, threatened a \u201cmass mobilization\u201d if Mr. Fillon tried to liberalize the economy too much. He warned that Mr. Fillon\u2019s platform was little more than a pretext to strip workers of rights while companies profited.Mr. Fillon argues it\u2019s time for France to \u201cgo around the unions.\u201dAnd where mass demonstrations have struck fear into the hearts of previous presidents, Mr. Fillon\u2019s attitude is: Bring it on.\u201cI\u2019m willing to face strikes if that\u2019s the price to save France,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Technology Start-Ups to Get a License to Bank", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byRegulators are planning to create a new type of banking license that will allow upstart financial technology companies to expand more quickly across the country.The licenses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees many national banks, will be available to companies like Square and Lending Club that accept deposits, facilitate electronic payments or lend money.Many technology firms have been pushing for some sort of new regulatory system that would allow them to cut through the patchwork of state and federal laws that govern financial activities and make it hard to expand nationally.The introduction of the licenses, called special purpose national bank charters, underscores how quickly so-called fintech firms are growing and how significant they are considered to the future of the financial industry.\u201cProviding a national charter to those responsible innovators who seek one and meet our high standards can help promote economic growth across the country and recognizes that technology-based products and services are the future of banking and the economy,\u201d Mr. Curry said in a speech at Georgetown University.But consumer advocates and state banking regulators have already been expressing concern that a new national charter could allow start-ups to get around state laws intended to protect consumers in areas like payday lending.Mr. Valenti said that any weakening of state laws could be a particular problem at a time when the incoming president, Donald J. Trump, has promised to broadly cut back federal financial regulations.Mr. Curry acknowledged some of these concerns in his speech on Friday, but he argued that competition in the financial industry was driving down the prices of financial products and opening access to the financial system for lower-income people who used to be shut out.\u201cWhat excites me most about the changes occurring in financial services is the great potential to expand financial inclusion, reach unbanked and underserved populations, make products and services safer and more efficient, and accelerate their delivery,\u201d Mr. Curry said.Companies applying for the new charter would need to demonstrate their commitment to \u201cfinancial inclusion,\u201d the agency said on Friday.The financial industry has been shaken up in recent years by tech start-ups that have taken on business services that were traditionally restricted to banks, like lending and electronic payments.Mr. Curry noted that the amount of investment going into these so-called fintech companies had risen to $24 billion from $1.8 billion five years ago.Companies like Lending Club, an online loan marketplace, and Square, which allows small businesses to accept electronic payments, have been changing the ways Americans expect to receive financial services. These companies have also operated outside of some of the regulatory constraints on traditional banks.Regulators around the world have scrambled to keep up with the new developments and ensure that customers of the new companies are receiving the same protections they have had in the traditional financial system. Entrepreneurs have complained that existing regulations are stifling new innovation.Some countries, like Britain and Singapore, have tried to create a friendlier regulatory environment to encourage the new players and attract new companies.Of the many financial regulators in the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been the most active in trying to keep up with the changes in the industry. Earlier this year, the agency created an Office of Innovation to serve as a central point of contact for new companies that are trying to figure out their regulatory responsibilities.Banks and state bank supervisors have strongly objected to the agency\u2019s moves on this front, seeing them as a way to allow in new competitors without forcing them to follow all the existing rules.For their part, many fintech start-ups have complained that under existing rules they have to partner with traditional banks, which often do not want to work with them, to provide basic financial services.\u201cIt\u2019s great to have this new charter as an option,\u201d said John Beccia, the general counsel at Circle, a start-up based in Boston that allows customers to send instant payments as well as to buy and hold virtual currencies. \u201cThere are a lot of benefits to this.\u201dUnder the current rules, Circle has to hold all of its customers\u2019 deposits in a partner bank and has to use the bank\u2019s systems any time it wants to move money to another customer or issue a credit card. With a license, Circle and other companies might be able to offer many of these services on their own.Mr. Curry said on Friday that fintech companies could continue to work under the existing rules, partnering with banks, but would have the option of applying for the new charter.It is unclear if companies chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would be able to get the deposit insurance offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Banks and consumer advocates have expressed the most concern over the possibility that a national charter for fintech companies could allow new online lenders to evade state caps on interest rates and other local rules designed to cut down on predatory lending.Mr. Curry\u2019s agency will not begin offering the charters until after a public comment period that ends in January.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Moves to Curb Ticket Scalping, Banning Bots Used Online", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byWith public attention focused on the scourge of online ticket scalping, Congress has passed a bill outlawing bots, or computer programs that let users scoop up the best tickets and resell them at inflated prices.But will this law be enough to tame an $8 billion secondary ticket market that is increasingly global?On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, or BOTS Act, with bipartisan support, following the bill\u2019s passage a week ago in the Senate. It will now go to the White House for President Obama\u2019s signature.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who was a sponsor of the bill and campaigned for its passage with Mr. Miranda and others, cheered the action by the House.\u201cWith this soon-to-be-new law that will eliminate \u2018bots\u2019 and slap hackers with a hefty fine, we can now ensure those who want to attend shows in the future will not have to pay outrageous, unfair prices,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement.Yet in the trenches of the music industry, there is doubt about how much impact the act will have. The world of bots is shadowy and little understood, with much of the software being developed and even operated overseas, complicating enforcement. And there is an enormous incentive for scalping, which is legal and now largely integrated into the mainstream concert business through sites like StubHub and even Ticketmaster.\u201cThere is only one way to stop the scalping industry, and that\u2019s to make it illegal,\u201d said Seth Hurwitz, an independent concert promoter and the owner of the 9:30 Club in Washington. \u201cAnything else is just Whac-a-Mole, and grandstanding by politicians.\u201dThe passage of the BOTS Act is the result of years of frustration among members of the public as well as artists and producers irritated by an industry that profits from their work. In an interview, Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer of \u201cHamilton,\u201d called scalping \u201ca usurious, parasitic business that only serves to create a new profit center between the artist and the consumer.\u201dThe BOTS Act would make it illegal to bypass an online security system like TicketMaster\u2019s.\u201cLaws don\u2019t stop every crime, but the fact that there are new civil penalties for circumventing the technology that tries to keep tickets in the hands of fans will create a disincentive,\u201d said Daryl P. Friedman, the chief advocacy and industry relations officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization behind the Grammy Awards, which lobbied for the bill.Yet even the BOTS Act\u2019s biggest supporters acknowledge that as much as they welcome the proposed law, it alone will not end the problems of online ticket scalping.\u201cIs this the exact bill I would write? No. Is it imperfect? Of course,\u201d said Mr. Seller, the \u201cHamilton\u201d producer. \u201cIs it better than nothing? You bet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guilty Verdict for I.M.F. Chief Christine Lagarde: A Primer", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byShe will not serve jail time or have to pay a fine. Butut her position at the Washington-based I.M.F. is on shaky ground, at a time when the organization faces questions over its participation in a multibillion-dollar bailout for Greece and uncertainty about the role of the United States in the organization. The fund\u2019s executive board will meet later on Monday to consider its options.Here is a quick primer on the case.Ms. Lagarde was accused of \u201cnegligence by a person in a position of public authority,\u201d related to a 2007 arbitration case involving Bernard Tapie, a French tycoon close to Nicolas Sarkozy, then France\u2019s president. In the case, Mr. Tapie was awarded more than 400 million euros, or $430 million, to settle a dispute with the partly state-owned bank Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais.The size of the award stunned and angered the French public, and some of Ms. Lagarde\u2019s advisers suggested that she take action to appeal the arbitration decision. But she declined to do because, her lawyer said, it would have resulted in costly new lawsuits by Mr. Tapie.She maintained her innocence throughout the trial, calling the charges politically motivated.The case was heard by the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique, a special court founded in 1993 to consider criminal cases against government officials. It is made up of 12 French Parliament members and three Supreme Court justices.Ms. Lagarde can appeal the case on procedural grounds to France\u2019s highest criminal court, the Cour de Cassation. But her lawyer has suggested she may not because there was not any punishment. The court, which noted her national and international stature, spared her a criminal record.Her position in the I.M.F. is under scrutiny. At the fund\u2019s executive board meeting on Monday, the board could ask for her resignation immediately, or Ms. Lagarde could offer it voluntarily.But both of these steps are considered remote, given that the board just backed her for a second term in February.The I.M.F.\u2019s directors have been well aware of Ms. Lagarde\u2019s legal difficulties in France, which have dogged her for around a decade. With the specter of an acquittal rising, it was expected that Ms. Lagarde would quickly move past the issues.The surprise verdict could increase pressure on the fund to widen its leadership search. The I.M.F.\u2019s practice of awarding the top job to a senior European official has come under increased criticism in recent years, especially as the influence of emerging economies has grown.Of the last six leaders of the fund, four have come from France. The last two \u2014 Ms. Lagarde and her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn \u2014 have encountered serious legal problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Cash in Finland. Must Be Jobless.", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Finland will soon hand out cash to 2,000 jobless people, free of bureaucracy or limits on side earnings. The idea, universal basic income, is gaining traction worldwide.Supported byOULU, Finland \u2014 No one would confuse this frigid corner of northern Finland with Silicon Valley. Notched in low pine forests just 100 miles below the Arctic Circle, Oulu seems more likely to achieve dominance at herding reindeer than at nurturing technology start-ups.But this city has roots as a hub for wireless communications, and keen aspirations in innovation. It also has thousands of skilled engineers in need of work. Many were laid off by Nokia, the Finnish company once synonymous with mobile telephones and more recently at risk of fading into oblivion.While entrepreneurs are eager to put these people to work, the rules of Finland\u2019s generous social safety net effectively discourage this. Jobless people generally cannot earn additional income while collecting unemployment benefits or they risk losing that assistance. For laid-off workers from Nokia, simply collecting a guaranteed unemployment check often presents a better financial proposition than taking a leap with a start-up in Finland, where a shaky technology industry is trying to find its footing again.Now, the Finnish government is exploring how to change that calculus, initiating an experiment in a form of social welfare: universal basic income. Early next year, the government plans to randomly select roughly 2,000 unemployed people \u2014 from white-collar coders to blue-collar construction workers. It will give them benefits automatically, absent bureaucratic hassle and minus penalties for amassing extra income.The government is eager to see what happens next. Will more people pursue jobs or start businesses? How many will stop working and squander their money on vodka? Will those liberated from the time-sucking entanglements of the unemployment system use their freedom to gain education, setting themselves up for promising new careers? These areas of inquiry extend beyond economic policy, into the realm of human nature.The answers \u2014 to be determined over a two-year trial \u2014 could shape social welfare policy far beyond Nordic terrain. In communities around the world, officials are exploring basic income as a way to lessen the vulnerabilities of working people exposed to the vagaries of global trade and automation. While basic income is still an emerging idea, one far from being deployed on a large scale, the growing experimentation underscores the deep need to find effective means to alleviate the perils of globalization.The search has gained an extraordinary sense of urgency as a wave of reactionary populism sweeps the globe, casting the elite establishment as the main beneficiary of economic forces that have hurt the working masses. Americans\u2019 election of Donald J. Trump, who has vowed to radically constrain trade, and the stunning vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, have resounded as emergency sirens for global leaders. They must either update capitalism to share the spoils more equitably, or risk watching angry mobs dismantle the institutions that have underpinned economic policy since the end of World War II.Universal basic income is a catchall phrase that describes a range of proposals, but they generally share one feature: All people in society get a regular check from the government \u2014 regardless of their income or whether they work. These funds are supposed to guarantee food and shelter, enabling people to pursue their own betterment while contributing to society.A Silicon Valley start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is preparing a pilot project in Oakland, Calif., in which 100 families will receive unconditional cash grants ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 a month. Voters in Switzerland recently rejected a basic-income scheme, but the French Senate approved a trial. Experiments are being readied in Canada and the Netherlands. The Indian government has been studying basic income as a means of alleviating poverty.\u201cThe last two years, there\u2019s been an explosion of interest in basic income,\u201d says Guy Standing, a research associate with the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, and a co-founder of the Basic Income Earth Network, an institution created to promote the idea. \u201cThe elites realize that the inequalities are becoming politically dangerous.\u201dFor generations, policy makers have sought the magic formula for so-called full employment, with nearly everyone who wants a job able to find one. Traditional unemployment insurance schemes were devised in an age when the cyclical nature of factory life was dominant. Workers who were idled in lean times could pay their bills using unemployment benefits while awaiting the inevitable return of flush ones.Basic income is intended to be permanent, built for an age in which demand for labor may be perpetually slack. Whatever happens \u2014 say everyone becomes a part-time Uber driver, or Uber drivers are replaced by self-driving cars \u2014 everyone can count on sustenance.Strikingly, basic income is being championed across the ideological spectrum.Utopian dreamers envision it as an emancipation from the meaninglessness of low-wage work. People stuck in dead-end jobs at fast-food restaurants could abandon laboring over the fryolator in favor of growing organic vegetables and reading to their children.Labor advocates embrace basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power, enabling workers to eschew poverty-level wages while holding out for better.Libertarians see it as a means of shrinking government by consolidating social service programs. Liberals envision it as a way to remove the stigma of public assistance: Instead of standing in line at the grocery store bearing food stamps while suffering the judgment of other shoppers \u2014 Shouldn\u2019t she be buying spinach instead of frozen pizza? \u2014 poor people would get the same check as everyone else.The technology world has seized on basic income as the response to automation and its threat of joblessness. If everyone\u2019s needs are being met, then society can embrace robots and liberation from drudge work.If every American were to receive just $10,000 a year, the tab would be roughly $3 trillion a year, roughly eight times what the United States now spends on social service programs. The government might just as well commit to handing out unicorns.Beyond arithmetic, basic income confronts fundamental disagreements about human reality. If people are released from fears that \u2014 absent work \u2014 they risk finding themselves sleeping outdoors, will they devolve into freeloaders?\u201cSome people think basic income will solve every problem under the sun, and some people think it\u2019s from the hand of Satan and will destroy our work ethic,\u201d says Olli Kangas, who oversees research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers many social welfare programs. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can create some knowledge on this issue.\u201dHalf a millennium ago, Thomas More\u2019s seminal novel, \u201cUtopia,\u201d included the suggestion that public assistance might be a better way to deter thieves than a death sentence. More than two centuries later, the American revolutionary agitator Thomas Paine proposed creating a national pool of money distributed to every adult.The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. promoted basic income. The libertarian economist Milton Friedman embraced a variant: negative income taxes that would put cash in the pockets of the poor.Yet with the exception of a few experiments, basic income has been confined to the margins of policy conversations.Until now.Finland\u2019s concerns are pragmatic. The government has no interest in freeing wage earners to write poetry. It is eager to generate more jobs.The global financial crisis and its aftermath played out against a wrenching economic refashioning here. The growth of tablets and smartphones assailed a major industry, commercial paper manufacturing. A crisis in neighboring Russia diminished trade. Over the last decade, Finland\u2019s economy has grown not at all.But the social safety net also appears to be impeding the reinvigoration of the economy by discouraging unemployed people from working part time.\u201cIt always should be worth taking the job rather than staying home and taking the benefits,\u201d says Finland\u2019s minister for social affairs and health, Pirkko Mattila. \u201cWe have to take the risk to do this experiment.\u201dOulu, a city of nearly 200,000 people on the Nordic Sea, stands as a potentially fertile testing ground.In centuries past, inhabitants occupied themselves shipping salmon and tar upriver to Russia while trying not to freeze to death. More recently, the city has evolved into a center for wireless communications.Three years ago, Microsoft purchased Nokia\u2019s handset business, raising local hopes of a revival. But last year, Microsoft went on to shutter the operation. Local Nokia jobs have been halved, falling to 2,500 from 5,000. Oulu\u2019s unemployment rate now sits above 16 percent, more than double the national average.City leaders portray this as an opportunity to start over, describing a future centered on companies like Asmo Solutions.With its office in a first-story walk-up, the company checks the boxes for requisite elements of a modern start-up. Coders stare into laptops while leaning against beanbag chairs arrayed across red shag carpeting. The founder, Asmo Saloranta, 35, wears a silver hoop earring, his blond hair pulled back into a ponytail. He used to be chief executive; now he is chief visionary. He has designed a phone charger that draws power only when a phone is connected.Oulu is an ideal place to start a technology business, he says: \u201cThere are highly talented tech people.\u201dBut hiring them is maddeningly complicated.Mr. Saloranta has his eyes on a former Nokia employee who is masterly at developing prototypes. He only needs him part time. He could pay 2,000 euros a month (about $2,090). Yet this potential hire is bringing home more than that via his unemployment benefits.\u201cIt\u2019s more profitable for him to just wait at home for some ideal job,\u201d Mr. Saloranta complains.Basic income would fix this, he says: \u201cIt would activate many more unemployed people.\u201dThis is a part of the debate that often gets missed. Monthly checks for everyone may look like socialism, but proponents advance it as a way to invigorate capitalism.From Italy to India, companies that would like to leave behind unprofitable enterprises in favor of fresh pursuits hold back because of the expense and reputational damage of firing people. Basic income could be the tool that makes restructuring palatable.With basic income in place, companies might be more inclined to take a risk on hiring more aggressively \u2014 adding vigor to the local economy \u2014 knowing they have the freedom to be ruthless in cutting loose those workers who prove disappointing.\u201cIt does make it easier to have labor flexibility,\u201d says Karl Widerquist, a philosopher at Georgetown University in Qatar, and a leading advocate for basic income. \u201cI know that if I have to close down this operation, everyone is going to be O.K.\u201dPeople who lose jobs would do well to gain training in modern trades. On this point, economists universally concur. Yet in many countries, social welfare systems are so laden with rules that jobless people tend to acquire just one skill: They gain savvy in navigating the bureaucracy.This dependency is a key justification for basic income. If people receive money without having to endure appointments with government bureaucrats, they will have time for more productive exploits.\u201cBasic income is kind of a symbol that we believe in your capacity and we think that you are actually able to do things which are beneficial to you, and also for your community,\u201d says Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at Helsinki University. \u201cIt\u2019s built on a kind of a positive view of human beings. People want to be autonomous. They want to improve their well-being.\u201dJaana Matila has three degrees in computing and an obsessive interest in software, and intense aspirations to forge a career in the Oulu technology scene.What she does not have \u2014 has never had \u2014 is a full-time job.At 29, she has completed three unpaid internships. Her last stint ended when her employer folded.She teaches adults to swim. She catches freelance jobs, recently designing a website for a hair salon. Mostly, she lives on unemployment benefits \u2014 700 euros a month (about $732).Ms. Matila would like to do more freelance work, but she lives in fear of derailing her unemployment benefits. She is supposed to fill out forms that account for every bit of income while providing pay stubs, bank documents and work contracts. Earlier this year, she failed to secure a receipt for the swim lessons. While she tracked one down, she lost her benefits for a month.\u201cI had to ask my boyfriend, \u2018Can you give me some monthly money so I can buy some food?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating.\u201dShe thinks about starting a website. Mostly, though, she goes for walks through the forest with her dog. She frets that she is falling behind in skills as technology advances.\u201cPeople in a disadvantaged position, they use a major part of their cognitive ability worrying about their lives, worrying about where they will get their next meal,\u201d says Mikko Annala, a researcher at Demos Helsinki, a think tank. \u201cWhat if we have this potential there that is continuously worrying about life, about making it? What if we can get that into use by giving them something? That is a hypothesis that we should absolutely test.\u201dThe most compelling argument against basic income is the most obvious: If everyone gets money without a requirement to do anything, humans may become morally depraved slackers.Jari Viljala finds this notion ridiculous.An electrician by trade, Mr. Viljala is accustomed to braving Arctic blasts of wind in minus-35-degree temperatures while threading wires into the spines of new housing complexes. He has left his wife and two daughters behind for as long as eight months at a time to venture north for construction projects.His gaze intense, his arms covered in tattoos, he takes pride in his reputation as the guy who will do anything.\u201cThe dirtiest, trickiest job that no one else wanted to do,\u201d he says, \u201cI have always volunteered.\u201dBut since the summer, Mr. Viljala has been out of work. His 3,300 euros in monthly wages (about $3,450) have given way to 650 euros (about $680) in monthly unemployment benefits.He needs money for new brakes on his 11-year-old Ford sedan, which failed inspection. Without a car, he cannot get to what work he may secure. He also needs money to get current on the rent, having fallen more than two months behind.At 36, he is wiry and strong. He could earn additional cash on the side. But the unemployment rules say otherwise.So he stays home and does what he can \u2014 making dinner for his girls, doing the laundry. He rides the bus through the gray dawn to the unemployment office.He waits and he worries. He wonders how it makes any sense that an able-bodied man with every compulsion to work must stay idle to ensure that he can support his family.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Is Europe\u2019s Landlord. And Tenants Are Fighting Back.", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 The Tobun family never missed a rental payment on their modest brick rowhouse in eight years. But in February, the couple, who have two young children, received a letter warning that they would have to leave their home when the lease expired. Forty of their neighbors got the same notice.When they went to investigate, the tenants, in the working-class suburb of Tyrrelstown, discovered a trail that led all the way to Wall Street.After Europe was ravaged by a financial and economic crisis, the giant investment bank Goldman Sachs snapped up huge swaths of distressed debt in Ireland, including the loans of Tyrrelstown\u2019s developer in 2014. The developer now wants out of the rental game and is selling the properties. As the owner of the loans, Goldman will reap a large portion of the proceeds.Goldman has nothing to do with the actions here. But because American banks have played such a large role in Europe\u2019s housing recovery \u2014 and have made huge profits in the process \u2014 they have become the main target of a growing backlash among homeowners and renters.\u201cSomehow, these funds have gotten involved in our community,\u201d Funke Tobun said. \u201cThey\u2019re profiting, but it\u2019s the people who are being made to suffer.\u201dThe firms have made the usual calculation: buy distressed investments on the cheap during tough times, betting that the outlook will eventually turn and riches will follow. And the firms are paying little or no tax, by employing complex strategies that often involve subsidiaries with no operations or staff.The huge profits and dubious tax strategies have made Wall Street a major object of frustration and anger, as people grapple with evictions and higher mortgage payments. In some cases, the Wall Street firms are passive players, the money men behind the landlords, developers or banks that are exerting force. In other cases, they are direct participants taking action.Despite the controversy, the firms \u2014 and their purchases \u2014 have played a vital role in the cleanup of Europe\u2019s mess.Wall Street stepped in, buying mortgages on commercial properties, rental developments and even individual homes. The much-needed cash helped mend national finances, halt plunging property values and clean up banks\u2019 books.\u201cInvestment by foreign capital has helped restart the system and accelerate the adjustment and recovery,\u201d a spokesman for Goldman, Sebastian Howell, said.But the recovery has been uneven, leaving homeowners and renters with few options after they run into trouble.Homeowners who have fallen behind are being pressured to accept harsher terms that could tilt them toward foreclosure. Residents are being plied with fees that make it harder to stay in their properties. And even tenants who have not missed rental payments are being forced out at a time when rising property values make it difficult to find affordable housing.Whether or not Wall Street is directly involved, activists are invoking the firms to fire up the masses. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that these funds are not mainstream banks or charities,\u201d said David Hall, director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organization, a nonprofit that helps troubled homeowners. \u201cThey sell to make profit and they exit.\u201dProtesters have occupied empty apartments in Barcelona whose mortgages had been bought by Blackstone, and rallied around tenants in Madrid who were served eviction recently by a Goldman-run subsidiary. In Ireland, homeowners seeking protection have demonstrated outside Parliament.The deals are now getting a second look. The Spanish authorities are putting in place protections for tenants and homeowners. The Irish finance minister introduced legislation in October to tighten oversight of Wall Street\u2019s tax arrangements.In Tyrrelstown, tenants have asked the government to intervene, so they can remain in their homes. After receiving their lease termination notices, several families moved into a hostel.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t stand the pressure,\u201d Mrs. Tobun said. \u201cThey were scared of ending up homeless.\u201dFor decades, Tyrrelstown was a blank slate on the northwestern edge of Dublin, acres of rolling fields with just a few homes dotting the landscape.When Ireland joined the euro currency union in 1999, it all changed. Foreign capital flooded the country, and the economy soared. With seemingly endless growth in this so-called Celtic Tiger, banks made freewheeling loans to property developers like Rick and Michael Larkin, the brothers behind Twinlite, the developer that built Mrs. Tobun\u2019s home.The brothers undertook one of Ireland\u2019s most ambitious developments. More than 2,000 cookie-cutter-style homes were erected over vacant land that had at one point been targeted for a landfill. With three floors, modest kitchens and tidy backyards, the properties attracted teachers, police officers and other working-class tenants to an increasingly multicultural enclave.By 2006, the Larkins had added a sprawling retail center to Tyrrelstown along with a $40 million luxury four-star hotel, with 155 rooms, a fusion restaurant and an oak-paneled boardroom. At a ribbon-cutting ceremony, Bertie Ahern, then Ireland\u2019s prime minister, promoted the construction as \u201ca vote of confidence by its developers in the future of our economy.\u201dSimilar developments sprouted up across the country. By 2006, bank lending for development had grown in Ireland to more than \u20ac95 billion, from \u20ac5.5 billion in 1999. Construction comprised a quarter of the country\u2019s economic activity.Then the global financial crisis struck in 2008, and the Irish economy began to crumble. Despite warning signs, the Larkins kept building, unveiling plans for a \u20ac100 million, 11-story indoor ski slope and ice-climbing center. As the crisis deepened, city planners rejected the project.Many developers and homeowners could not pay their loans, leaving banks saddled with huge portfolios of troubled debt. Banks began frantically looking for ways to reduce their loads, even trying to get rid of the loans of borrowers like Twinlite that had not fallen behind. The government helped accelerate the process, setting up the National Asset Management Agency to package and sell off bad loans, a role that was expanded after Ireland\u2019s bailout in 2010.Wall Street firms saw opportunity, with loans selling at up to 70 percent off their face value. The firms bought nearly \u20ac100 billion worth of Irish distressed debt.Twinlite\u2019s loans in Tyrrelstown were among those picked up in the frenzy by Beltany Property Finance, a Goldman affiliate. Twinlite said it opposed the sale and sued the issuing bank, unsuccessfully, to have it halted.After that, Tyrrelstown residents faced two options: buy their properties or lose their homes..The County Council, to which Tyrrelstown residents had appealed for help, told Mrs. Tobun that a state-backed home loan might be available to purchase her property.. But Mrs. Tobun, who nets \u20ac1,000 a month caring for older people, could not afford the \u20ac16,000 down payment. Her husband, who drives a taxi, could expect to earn \u20ac40 on a 12-hour shift, compared with almost \u20ac150 before the crisis.Her worst fear, Mrs. Tobun said, was that her family might wind up among the growing ranks of the homeless.Mrs. Tobun does not have many options. She does not want to move farther out, since it would mean changing schools for her son who has special needs. A nearby rental is too expensive. Rents in Ireland have risen around 20 percent since the crisis as home construction dried up after the bust.Still, the effort showed that her home and the others in Tyrrelstown were worth much more as empty sales properties than as long-term rentals. In a statement, the Larkin family denied that Goldman\u2019s subsidiary exerted pressure to end the leases or sell. The statement said a Larkin-owned company wanted to exit the residential rental business, given regulatory changes and improving market conditions.For Tyrrelstown residents, the battles have been an all-consuming ordeal. After receiving a notice in May, Gillian Murphy and her partner, Damien Moore, refused to move from the home they had rented for six years. One of their three children has autism, and switching schools would put him at the bottom of the list for programs elsewhere.Soon after the family received the notice terminating their lease, two men working for the Larkin-owned entity arrived at their home and began taking pictures. \u201cEveryone is petrified of these people because we don\u2019t know who they are or what the purpose is,\u201d Ms. Murphy said.Before last year, few people in Ireland had heard of Cerberus Capital. Like other Wall Street players, Cerberus came into the country quietly, creating a local subsidiary under a different name and setting up a complex and extensive web of interconnected businesses.There are the 13 subsidiaries in Dublin, all with Promontoria in their names. They have no employees and no offices. They are all registered to the same address on Grant\u2019s Row, a letterbox near Parliament. Those subsidiaries, in turn, are subsidiaries of holding companies in the Netherlands, more than 110 of which had the Promontoria name.The structure has helped Cerberus profit in Ireland. Through the subsidiaries, Cerberus bought around \u20ac17 billion worth of loans on properties in Ireland and Britain in two years, for just under \u20ac6 billion euros. In Ireland alone, Cerberus has been earning hundreds of millions of euros in interest and other income.The setup, promoted by the Irish government along with other tax strategies, allows for a bit of tax magic that can make those profits seem to disappear.To buy the debt, Cerberus\u2019s Dutch Promontoria companies lent Cerberus\u2019s Irish Promontoria firms money at a high interest rate. The Irish businesses ended up paying roughly the same amount in interest that was earned on the real estate investments. Since the interest was deductible, Cerberus cut its tax bill drastically.One Irish subsidiary, Promontoria Eagle, which bought distressed loans in Northern Ireland and Britain, earned interest income in 2014 of 111 million British pounds on the deal, or around $140 million. After deducting interest charges and management and audit fees, taxable profit was only \u00a37,788. The resulting tax charge in Ireland: just \u00a31,947.Corporate filings for five other Irish subsidiaries of Cerberus, provided by DueDil, a corporate intelligence firm, show the same pattern: taxable profit and tax charges reduced to nearly identical numbers. Portfolios with up to \u00a31 billion worth of loans wound up with tax charges of less than \u00a32,000.Other Wall Street firms employed a similar method. Beltany, the Goldman subsidiary, earned interest income of \u20ac44 million on debt portfolios in Ireland at the end of 2014. After lowering taxable profit to \u20ac1,000, it netted a tax charge of \u20ac250, filings show.Lone Star collected interest income of more than $970 million at the end of 2014. Its taxable profit was just over $11 million, resulting in a tax charge of less than $1 million.\u201cWall Street firms have made a lot of profit from other people\u2019s misfortunes, and on top of that they\u2019ve systematically structured things so they pay almost no tax,\u201d said James Stewart, a finance professor at Trinity College, Dublin. \u201cSo what\u2019s their contribution to society?\u201dCerberus and Lone Star declined to comment. Goldman said that Beltany followed Irish law and that the interest it collected was subject to United States tax.On a warm summer day, 20 people crowded into a basement in central Dublin. The dimly lit room had recently been converted into makeshift headquarters for the Hub, a grass-roots operation that enlisted volunteer accountants and lawyers to help people who were facing eviction.David Walsh, a former firefighter living in Ballybunion, on the west coast of Ireland, drove six hours to attend the meeting. Two years ago, Lone Star\u2019s Irish affiliate had scooped up the mortgage on his family\u2019s award-winning bed-and-breakfast, the Ballybunion B&B, for a fraction of the original cost. He was angered that he had not been allowed to buy back his loan at the cheap price the fund received.Soon after, he said, the affiliate mounted an effort to increase his mortgage payments. In the crisis, his bookings had slumped badly, and his original bank had agreed to lower his monthly payments to \u20ac800 from \u20ac2,000.\u201cThey phoned me every day of the week and at night saying we have to increase the payments,\u201d Mr. Walsh said of the Lone Star affiliate.When the Hub\u2019s lawyers questioned the legality of Lone Star\u2019s ownership of his mortgage, Mr. Walsh diverted his loan payments into an escrow fund as a form of protest until the issue could be resolved. \u201cThe amount of harm being done to vulnerable people is immense,\u201d he said.Mr. Walsh was threatened with foreclosure, which he continues to fight.A broader rebellion has barreled ahead in Spain, where Blackstone, Goldman and other American firms bought residential properties, including subsidized rentals.While low-income rentals represent a small piece of their portfolios, the companies ignited a firestorm when they began evicting squatters, in an effort to improve property values. The activist group P.A.H. organized protests around Spain and outside Blackstone\u2019s New York headquarters.Blackstone and Goldman said they had evicted just a small number of squatters and aimed to keep renters in the properties long-term. Goldman said its policy was to help certain distressed tenants avoid eviction.The perceived invasion has prompted a political reassessment. Some Spanish regional authorities have passed laws intended to clamp down on Wall Street\u2019s involvement. Catalonia now requires firms to offer cheap alternative housing to tenants. The local authorities can also buy back homes or expropriate them if they are left empty for three years.So popular was the anti-eviction movement that Ada Colau, its main leader, was elected mayor of Barcelona last year. \u201cThe opacity and distance of a fund that is based much farther away makes it a lot harder to hold it responsible,\u201d she said.In Ireland, the Tyrrelstown episode has become a rallying cry.Housing advocates and lawmakers across the political spectrum are urging stricter oversight. Along with new legislation intended to close tax loopholes and restrict mass evictions, lawmakers are considering requiring banks and financial firms to follow a code of conduct and provide alternatives for troubled homeowners.But for Mrs. Tobun and other Tyrrelstown residents, such changes may offer little relief.Recently, she and her neighbors received word that their rents would rise sharply in the new year, after their current contracts expire. She said she and most of the 40 tenants affected would be unable to pay.The new rents will be closer to current market prices, but many residents suspect that the increase is a tactic being used to flush them out so the properties can be sold. In response, the Tyrrelstown community is planning another series of demonstrations.\u201cThis is a fight between David and Goliath,\u201d Mrs. Tobun said. \u201cThey want us out by force. All we can do is protest.\u201d\u201cWe believe in miracles,\u201d she added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to win.\u201dAn article last Sunday about European residents\u2019 fighting back against Wall Street firms that have snapped up distressed housing debt referred imprecisely to notices that were given to some tenants. While the notices told them their leases were being terminated and that they would have to leave the property, they were not given eviction notices. The error was repeated in two accompanying picture captions. The article also referred incorrectly to a loan offered to one resident to help her buy her place. The County Council, not the developer, made the offer.Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Barcelona, and Douglas Dalby from Dublin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s Surge in Tourism Keeps Food Off Residents\u2019 Plates", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 For Lisset Felipe, privation is a standard facet of Cuban life, a struggle shared by nearly all, whether they\u2019re enduring blackouts or hunting for toilet paper.But this year has been different, in an even more fundamental way, she said. She has not bought a single onion this year, nor a green pepper, both staples of the Cuban diet. Garlic, she said, is a rarity, while avocado, a treat she enjoyed once in a while, is all but absent from her table.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Ms. Felipe, 42, who sells air-conditioners for the government. \u201cWe never lived luxuriously, but the comfort we once had doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201dTourists are quite literally eating Cuba\u2019s lunch. Thanks in part to the United States embargo, but also to poor planning by the island\u2019s government, goods that Cubans have long relied on are going to well-heeled tourists and the hundreds of private restaurants that cater to them, leading to soaring prices and empty shelves.Without supplies to match the increased appetite, some foods have become so expensive that even basic staples are becoming unaffordable for regular Cubans.\u201cThe private tourism industry is in direct competition for good supplies with the general population,\u201d said Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and specialist on the Cuban economy. \u201cThere are a lot of unanticipated consequences and distortions.\u201dThere has long been a divide between Cubans and tourists, with beach resorts and Havana hotels effectively reserved for outsiders willing to shell out money for a more comfortable version of Cuba. But with the country pinning its hopes on tourism, welcoming a surge of new travelers to feed the anemic economy, a more basic inequality has emerged amid the nation\u2019s experiment with capitalism.Rising prices for staples like onions and peppers, or for modest luxuries like pineapples and limes, have left many unable to afford them. Beer and soda can be hard to find, often snapped up in bulk by restaurants.It is a startling evolution in Cuba, where a shared future has been a pillar of the revolution\u2019s promise. While the influx of new money from tourists and other visitors has been a boon for the island\u2019s growing private sector, most Cubans still work within the state-run economy and struggle to make ends meet.President Ra\u00fal Castro has acknowledged the surge in agricultural prices and moved to cap them. In a speech in April, he said the government would look into the causes of the soaring costs and crack down on middlemen for price gouging, with limits on what people could charge for certain fruits and vegetables.\u201cWe cannot sit with our hands crossed before the unscrupulous manner of middlemen who only think of earning more,\u201d he told party members, according to local news reports.But the government price ceilings seem to have done little to provide good, affordable produce for Cubans. Instead, they have simply moved goods to the commercial market, where farmers and vendors can fetch higher prices, or to the black market.Havana offers stark examples of this growing chasm.At two state-run markets, where the government sets prices, the shelves this past week were monuments to starch \u2014 sweet potatoes, yucca, rice, beans and bananas, plus a few malformed watermelons with pallid flesh.As for tomatoes, green peppers, onions, cucumbers, garlic or lettuce \u2014 to say nothing of avocados, pineapples or cilantro \u2014 there were only promises.\u201cTry back Saturday for tomatoes,\u201d one vendor offered. It was more of question than a suggestion.But at a nearby co-op market, where vendors have more freedom to set their prices, the fruits and vegetables missing from the state-run stalls were elegantly stacked in abundance. Rarities like grapes, celery, ginger and an array of spices competed for shoppers\u2019 attentions.The market has become the playground of the private restaurants that have sprung up to serve visitors. They employ cadres of buyers to scour the city each day for fruits, vegetables and nonperishable goods, bearing budgets that overwhelm those of the average household.\u201cAlmost all of our buyers are paladares,\u201d said one vendor, Ruben Mart\u00ednez, using the Cuban name for private restaurants, which include about 1,700 establishments across the country. \u201cThey are the ones who can afford to pay more for the quality.\u201dBy Cuban standards, the prices were astronomic. Several Cuban residents said simply buying a pound of onions and a pound of tomatoes at the prices charged that day would consume 10 percent or so of a standard government salary of about $25 a month.\u201cI don\u2019t even bother going to those places,\u201d said Yainelys Rodriguez, 39, sitting in a park in Havana while her daughter climbed a slide. \u201cWe eat rice and beans and a boiled egg most days, maybe a little pork.\u201dMrs. Rodriguez\u2019s family is on the lower end of the income ladder, so she supplements earnings with the odd cleaning job she can find. With that, she cares for her two children and an infirm mother.Trying to buy tomatoes, she said, \u201cis an insult.\u201dAnother mother, Leticia Alvarez Ca\u00f1ada, described what it was like to prepare decent meals for her family with prices so high. \u201cWe have to be magicians,\u201d she said.The struggle is somewhat easier now that she is in the private sector and no longer working for the government, she said. She quit her job as a nurse to start a small business selling fried pork skin and other snacks from a cart. Now she earns about 10 times more every month.\u201cThe prices have just gone crazy in the last few years,\u201d said Mrs. Ca\u00f1ada, 41. \u201cThere\u2019s just no equilibrium between the prices and the salaries.\u201dWhile many Cubans have long been hardened to the reality of going without, never more than during what they call the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a new dynamic that has emerged in recent months threatens the nation\u2019s future, experts warn.\u201cThe government has consistently failed to invest properly in the agriculture sector,\u201d said Juan Alejandro Triana, an economist at the University of Havana. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have to feed 11 million people anymore. We have to feed more than 14 million.\u201d\u201cIn the next five years, if we don\u2019t do something about it, food will become a national security issue here,\u201d he added.The government gives Cubans ration books to help provide staples like rice, beans and sugar, but they do not cover items like fresh produce. Tractors and trucks are limited and routinely break down, often causing the produce to spoil en route. Inefficiency, red tape and corruption at the local level also stymie productivity, while a lack of fertilizer reduces yield (though it keeps produce organic, by default).Economists also argue that setting price ceilings can discourage farmers and sellers. If prices are set so low they cannot turn a profit, they argue, why bother working? Most will try to redirect their goods to the private or black market.\u201cFrom the point of view of the farmer, what would you do?\u201d asked Dr. Feinberg, the California professor. \u201cWhen the differentials are that great, it requires a really selfless or foolish person to play by the rules.\u201dPaladares sometimes go directly to farms to buy goods, and even provide farmers seeds for specialty products that do not ordinarily grow in Cuba, like arugula, cherry tomatoes and zucchini.Most acknowledge that they distort the market in some ways, and this year the government stopped issuing licenses for new restaurants in Havana. But some restaurant owners argue that it is the government\u2019s responsibility to create better supply.\u201cIt\u2019s true, the prices keep going up and up,\u201d said Laura Fernandez, a manager at El Cocinero, a former peanut-oil factory converted into a high-priced restaurant. \u201cBut that\u2019s not just the fault of the private sector. There is generally a lot of chaos and disorder in the market.\u201dOn the outskirts of Havana, Miguel Salcines has cultivated a beautiful farm. Rows of tidy crops stretch toward the edge of his modest 25 acres, where he employs about 130 people.Though he grows standard products on behalf of the government, there is no product he is more excited about than his new zucchini. A farmer for nearly 50 years, he had never grown the crop before, but planted a batch two months ago.Now, the vegetables are coming into shape, the spots of bright orange flowers visible amid the green plumage. He knows this crop is not for the regular market, or for the government. It is like the arugula he grows.It is for the tourist market and, by extension, the future.\u201cWe are talking about an elite market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Cuban markets are a market of necessity.\u201dHannah Berkeley Cohen and Kirk Semple contributed reporting from Havana, and Frances Robles from Miami.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill English Is Chosen as New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byMr. English, 54, was the favorite to succeed Mr. Key, 55, a popular prime minister who had led the National Party to three election victories since 2008. Next year, Mr. English, who was Mr. Key\u2019s finance minister and deputy prime minister, faces the challenge of winning a fourth consecutive election for the National Party.\u201cI want to be a prime minister where New Zealanders feel they can flourish here,\u201d Mr. English said at a news conference in Wellington on Monday. \u201cNot just some New Zealanders, all New Zealanders.\u201dNew Zealand political analysts said that while the National Party was expected to win the next election, the resignation of Mr. Key had given the left-wing Labour and Green Parties hope that they could still claim an unlikely victory.In explaining his decision to resign one year before his term ended, Mr. Key, a former Merrill Lynch executive, cited a desire to spend more time with his family and said he had never wanted to be a career politician.Analysts said Mr. English had his work cut out for him to replicate Mr. Key\u2019s popularity with voters.\u201cBill English is not a natural leader,\u201d Jon Johansson, a senior lecturer in the school of history, philosophy, political science and international relations at Victoria University in Wellington, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe is a technocrat, and that will make the task of the National Party winning a fourth consecutive term much more difficult.\u201dMr. Johansson put the chances of the National Party\u2019s winning the 2017 election at 50 to 60 percent. If Mr. Key had not stepped down, Mr. Johansson said, the party\u2019s chances would have risen to 90 percent.Still, Mr. English\u2019s steady stewardship of the New Zealand economy through the 2008 financial crisis counts in his favor. In 2016, economic growth has been 2.8 percent, and New Zealand\u2019s Treasury forecasts growth of 3.6 percent next year, with unemployment falling to 4.8 percent from the current 5 percent.\u201cHe\u2019s very experienced, and in political terms he is quite old,\u201d Colin James, one of New Zealand\u2019s best-known political commentators, said in an interview. \u201cIf he can maintain support for the National Party at around current levels, he will be well liked in the party.\u201dIn the 2014 election, the National Party got 47 percent of the vote. The Labour Party received 25 percent, and the Green Party received 11 percent. The National Party governs with the help of small right-wing parties.\u201cJohn Key dominated our politics and had his foot on the throat of the opposition for eight years,\u201d Mr. Johansson said.First elected to Parliament in 1990, Mr. English has also been a minister in charge of regulatory reform, education and health. He was sworn in as prime minister at a brief ceremony on Monday after Mr. Key formally resigned.A Catholic, Mr. English has opposed same-sex marriage, which became legal in New Zealand in 2013. Despite a reputation for lacking charisma, he displays a dry, laconic wit as a public speaker and has boxed publicly for charity. But in 2002, he led the National Party to its worst ever performance in a century, said Mr. James, the political commentator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump, Russia Goes From Thursday\u2019s Foe of U.S. to Friday\u2019s Friend", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The diatribe against the Obama administration on prime-time television by a Russian Foreign Ministry official was hardly unusual in the long history of rocky relations between the United States and Russia.The administration \u201cdemonstrated the belief that the strongest has the right to create evil,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said on the Christmas Day broadcast.With the sitting president calling Russia a national security threat and the incoming one praising Mr. Putin, many American voters, long accustomed to being suspicious about Russia, are understandably confused and uneasy. Russia was an enemy on Friday morning, and a friend by the afternoon.\u201cWe are in a whiplash moment right now, and I think it is unprecedented in several respects,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk assessment firm in Washington, and a former State Department official from the Clinton administration. \u201cThe most important one is that the baton is about to be passed from an administration with a very hard line on Russia to one that is very much more sympathetic.\u201dNo clear agreements or even offers are on the table yet, however, bringing uncertainty. \u201cRussia\u2019s relations with the U.S. are currently up in the air \u2014 both sides have no clear strategy about how to move them forward,\u201d said Aleksandr Morozov, an independent Russian political analyst.Thus began a long roller coaster ride for the two countries, full of periodic upswings as friends when d\u00e9tente was in vogue, inevitably followed by precipitous plummets as foes that left the world shuddering about the prospects of a nuclear Armageddon.Tensions eased periodically, but it never seemed to last.President Ronald Reagan, an implacable anti-Communist, surprised the world by reaching out to the man who turned out to be the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, to begin negotiations for far-reaching arms control agreements between the two sides.After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Russian Federation that emerged entered into an extended period of decline and, inevitably, friendship with the United States as a kind of junior partner.That \u201cjunior\u201d aspect rankled, however, particular after Mr. Obama went from seeking to reset relations to dismissing Russia as a \u201cregional power.\u201dThe latest crisis began in 2014, with a revolution in Ukraine that Mr. Putin labeled an American plot \u2014 he, as many Soviet leaders have, sees the hidden hand of Washington everywhere. Mr. Putin annexed Crimea and armed rebels in eastern Ukraine, prompting Western economic sanctions, which Mr. Trump has disparaged.The last confrontation under the Obama administration between Moscow and Washington came to a head this fall after American intelligence agencies concluded that hacking by their Russian counterparts had breached national security, cracking open the computers of the Democratic National Committee to reveal emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump initially encouraged the Kremlin to hack even more, breaking with all precedents, not least the Republican tradition of painting Russia as the evil empire, as Mr. Reagan called it.Mr. Obama waited to react until last week, and it looked as if he might leave his successor a diplomatic tempest, until Mr. Putin, long the master of the unexpected stroke, defused it.\u201cTrump\u2019s spirit is already here, and already changing Russia\u2019s policies,\u201d said Igor M. Bunin, the director of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow research institute. \u201cThis will be a great plus for future relations.\u201dThere are still potential pitfalls, however, not least that Congress does not share an affectionate view of Mr. Putin.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, plans to open hearings on Thursday on Russia\u2019s efforts to manipulate the presidential election. Much of the Republican establishment in Congress endorsed the new sanctions imposed against Russia, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump.\u201cThe Russian cyberattack, and the misinformation and propaganda \u2014 they have been living with this for decades,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview.American voters have heard Mr. Trump praise Russia, and some in the far right have hailed Mr. Putin as a hero for espousing conservative values. Yet old instincts die hard.\u201cI worry about what our relationship with other countries is going to be with a Trump presidency, if we buddy-buddy up to Russia and a leader who is not so democratic in nature,\u201d said Alexis Matter, 35, walking through a Denver shopping mall.In Sandy Springs, Ga., Chase Williams, 26, the manager of a pet supply store, said that Russia had fallen off the radar in recent years. His fears now were less of the old Cold War over a nuclear weapons attack than a sense that Mr. Putin could outfox the American administration.\u201cWhen I say Russia scares me, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m scared of them coming over here and doing something,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m scared when I see a chess player playing checkers \u2014 and we are checkers.\u201dMr. Putin has made no secret of the fact that he would like to re-establish the consensus reached with the United States at the 1945 Yalta conference that carved the globe into spheres of influence.Russia no longer has the might needed to assert its right to be a superpower, analysts say, but if nothing else, cyberattacks have underscored that you do not need nuclear weapons or a strong economy to assert global influence.Some Russian analysts wonder what Mr. Putin can offer Mr. Trump. A former K.G.B. agent, he tends to view the world order as a series of special operations, coming from a different arena than Mr. Trump\u2019s world of business deals. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Putin has a plan,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former media adviser to Mr. Putin. \u201cI think that he is stunned by the number of bonus points that he has gotten.\u201dIn Syria, President Bashar al-Assad is on the verge of reasserting control over much of the country, thanks largely to Mr. Putin\u2019s intervention. Ukraine presents some problems, but has essentially boiled down into the kind of frozen conflict that Russia uses to destabilize independent-minded neighbors. And all of the attention on the cyberattacks made Mr. Putin look strong.In those successes, analysts see fodder for Mr. Putin to offer Mr. Trump a manner of foreign policy victory that would give the American leader something tangible to crow about at home in an arena where he lacks experience.\u201cI think that Putin is in a strong position,\u201d said Nicolai Petrov, a Russian political scientist. \u201cHe looks strong in relation to the United States and he has freedom to maneuver, and he can do what he wants to demonstrate that the United States should recognize that Russia is not a regional power but a great power that should be taken into account.\u201dSo, for the moment, Mr. Putin appears a potential friend to Mr. Trump.Few expect it to last, however. First of all, Mr. Trump is unpredictable. And fundamentally, the two countries are destined to be at odds, because they view the world through different lenses.\u201cThey are trying to create more of a level playing field not by raising Russia up, but through a declining West,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Putin is out to make America great again.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow, Alan Blinder from Sandy Springs, Ga., Julie Turkewitz from Denver, and Noah Weiland from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Twinkie Made the Superrich Even Richer", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 4Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.Supported byThe snack cakes flew through the air into the crowd pressed against metal barriers. One man shoved cream-filled treats into his mouth. Another \u201cToday\u201d host tucked Twinkies into the neckline of her dress.Across the nation in the summer of 2013, there was a feeding frenzy for Twinkies. The iconic snack cake returned to shelves just months after Hostess had shuttered its bakeries and laid off thousands of workers. The return was billed on \u201cToday\u201d as \u201cthe sweetest comeback in the history of ever.\u201dNowhere was it sweeter, perhaps, than at the investment firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, which spent $186 million in cash to buy some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake bakeries and brands in early 2013.Less than four years later, they sold the company in a deal that valued Hostess at $2.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos have now reaped a return totaling 13 times their original cash investment.Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives like those at Apollo have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone, took home the largest haul last year: nearly $800 million. He and other private equity executives receive more annually than the leaders of Facebook and Apple, companies that revolutionized the way society communicates.The top executives at those six publicly traded private equity firms earned, on average, $211 million last year \u2014 which is about what Leon Black, a founder of Apollo, received. That amount was nearly 10 times what the average bank chief executive earned, though firms like Apollo face less public scrutiny on pay than banks do.Private equity firms note that much of their top executives\u2019 wealth stems from owning their own stock and that they have earned their fortunes bringing companies back to life by applying their operational and financial expertise. Hostess, a defunct snack brand that was quickly returned to profitability, is a textbook example of the success of this approach.Yet even as private equity\u2019s ability to generate huge profits is indisputable, the industry\u2019s value to the work force and the broader economy is still a matter of debate. Hostess, which has bounced between multiple private equity owners over the last decade, shows how murky the jobs issue can be.In 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy under the private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. Months later, with Ripplewood having lost control and the company\u2019s creditors in charge, Hostess was shut down and its workers sent home for good.Without investment from Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess brands and all those jobs might have vanished forever after the bankruptcy. The way these firms see it, they created a new company and new jobs with higher pay and generous bonuses.But the new Hostess employs only 1,200 people, a fraction of the roughly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs at Hostess\u2019s snack cake business during the 2012 bankruptcy.And some Hostess employees who got their jobs back lost them again. Under Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess shut down one of the plants they reopened in Illinois, costing 415 jobs.The collapse and revival of Hostess illustrates how even in a business success, many workers don\u2019t share in the gains. The episode also provides a snapshot of the economic forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the White House.Since losing his job at Hostess in 2012, Mark Popovich has had three jobs, including one that paid about $10 an hour, half what he made at the Twinkie-maker. A lifelong Democrat and devoted \u201cunion man,\u201d Mr. Popovich said he supported Mr. Trump, the first time he ever voted Republican.\u201cIt\u2019s getting old, getting bounced around all the time,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, a 58-year-old Ohio resident.Such frustrations stem from broader shifts in the economy, as all types of companies turn to automation to cut costs and labor unions lose their influence. While these changes have helped keep companies profitable, private equity has used these shifts in the workplace to supercharge wealth far beyond that of the typical chief executive.And yet, Mr. Trump did not focus on private equity on the campaign trail, instead blaming the plight of the American working class on a shadowy cabal of elitist Democrats and Wall Street bankers who support trade deals that ship jobs overseas.\u201cPeople understand jobs going to China,\u201d said Michael Hillard, an economics professor at the University of Southern Maine. \u201cBut no one has ever heard of these private equity firms that come in and do all this financial engineering. It is much more complicated and less visible.\u201d\u201cAt a time when many Americans are concerned about the country\u2019s economic viability, private equity has proven itself in communities throughout the United States as an effective solution,\u201d said James Maloney, the American Investment Council\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSustainable growth strategies, adherence to responsible investments and a long-view approach are all a part of the present-day private equity model.\u201dThe Times investigation of the Hostess deal shows that today\u2019s private equity also uses another set of tactics, like special dividends and tax arrangements, that maximize profits in creative, yet financially risky ways.Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life.A year after the layoffs at the Hostess plant in Illinois, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for the company to borrow about $1.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos used most of that sum to pay themselves, and their investors, an early dividend on their investment.The firms also found a way to make money even after the company was sold. The firms, The Times investigation found, struck a deal to collect as much as $400 million over the next 15 years, based on what Hostess\u2019s future tax savings might be.These winnings do not come without risk to the private equity firms, which are often taking a gamble on troubled companies, and when they fail, the firms probably lose out.And this is not a simple story of powerful investors enriching themselves while some workers struggle. Teachers and firefighters also benefit from private equity.Pension funds that pay retirement benefits to public servants now depend on private equity to generate huge returns. Without it, taxpayers could bear more of the costs.\u201cHostess\u2019s comeback was a win-win-win-win,\u201d an Apollo spokesman said in a statement, adding that its investment benefited workers, communities, investors and consumers. \u201cAfter teaming up to take on the daunting financial and operational challenge of creating a new company around the Hostess brand, Apollo and Metropoulos & Co. completed a highly successful private equity investment.\u201dOn a more basic level, Americans enjoy what private equity has owned: GNC vitamins, affordable jewelry at Zales, and birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.It may seem an unusual choice, but this party had a special affinity for the snack cake. The bride\u2019s father is an executive at Apollo.Leon Black grew up in a family that had a home in Westport, Conn., and an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard Business School.But when Mr. Black traveled to Lubbock, Tex., to speak to a group of retired teachers, he emphasized a humbler side of his pedigree.\u201cYou should know,\u201d Mr. Black said, according to a video recording of the February 2012 meeting, \u201cmy mother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my brother-in-law is a teacher. We have a lot of teachers in our family.\u201dMr. Black had good reason to flatter the retirees: Pension funds for teachers and other public workers are some of the biggest investors in Apollo\u2019s funds and have helped make Mr. Black a very rich man.Mr. Black, or an affiliated limited liability company, owns homes in Beverly Hills, Miami Beach and several locations in New York, an analysis of real estate records shows. This year, he bought the $38 million house in Beverly Hills that had belonged to the actor Tom Cruise.Private equity\u2019s relationship with pension funds is mutually beneficial. As countless baby boomers reach retirement at a time of historically low interest rates, public pension funds need to achieve returns that match their liabilities \u2014 and private equity has delivered.Nearly half of private equity\u2019s invested assets now come from public and private pensions around the world. Private equity uses this pension fund money to place bets on companies like Hostess, and Texas teachers have shared in the profits from the deal.The Teacher Retirement System of Texas has invested in the fund that bought Hostess. And that fund has reaped 27 percent net during the three years it owned Hostess, significantly more than the stock market returned in that period.\u201cYou need to get people in whom you trust and who will keep up our fund,\u201d said Fran Plemmons, a former president of the Texas Retired Teachers Association who was a teacher and principal for 25 years. \u201cIf they do that, you need to get out of the way.\u201dMs. Plemmons said her $31,200 yearly pension allows her to live modestly but comfortably. High returns from private equity investments, she said, help keep pension payments flowing to retired school workers across Texas, which trickles down into the local economy.For the teachers in Lubbock, Mr. Black described the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind its success: buying the debt of financially troubled companies or purchasing an entire company. The investments, he said, are \u201cvalue-oriented, if not contrarian.\u201dHostess fit that formula.Not only were Americans turning to healthier snacks and eating less junk food, but Hostess had its own challenges.In 2012, the baking company had gone through a bruising bankruptcy, its second in a decade. The company laid off most of its 18,500 unionized drivers, loaders and bakers, not long after the bakers\u2019 union voted for a companywide strike rather than accept another round of concessions.But what was disaster for previous owners looked like treasure to Apollo and Metropoulos.When Hostess lenders auctioned off the company in early 2013, Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake brands, which included Twinkies and Ding Dongs.Snack cakes still produced some of the highest profit margins in the food industry and Hostess cakes were particularly well-known. The bankruptcy also provided Apollo and Metropoulos a clean slate, liberating them from union contracts, labor rules and debt and pension payments.One group of workers who had no place at the new Hostess: the unionized drivers, who transported snack cakes and bread to grocery stores nationwide.Now, Hostess would send its baked goods to warehouses, where retailers like Walmart would ship to individual stores.Ronald Litland, 44, delivered Hostess products in Illinois for 10 years. After he was laid off in 2012, he enrolled in a for-profit college in hopes of finding a new career in information technology. When his unemployment benefits ran out, he delivered pizzas. He never finished school, but is still paying back student loans and taking care of his son.\u201cI have a hard time making ends meet,\u201d said Mr. Litland, who earns about $24,000 a year.Like the drivers, Hostess\u2019s baking operation was also cut back. Apollo and Metropoulos chose to buy only a handful of its roughly one dozen snack cake bakeries.Other parts of the former Hostess baking empire were scaled back as well. Food companies picked off some of Hostess\u2019s bread brands, but reopened only a small fraction of the bakeries.Before being laid off from Hostess, Mr. Popovich made about $20 an hour. Every year, he went on vacation in the Bahamas or St. Martin. His health insurance covered the $385,000 cost when his wife needed major surgery.\u201cI lived a good life,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, whose most recent job driving a forklift at a solar panel plant paid about $16 an hour.Mr. Popovich is also entitled to a pension, which he was promised after working more than two decades at Hostess. But he recently received a letter at his home in Toledo, Ohio, warning that the pension fund was nearly insolvent.Apollo and Metropoulos are not obligated to contribute to the pension fund, which is managed by a labor union. Nor do they have to pay the severance that Hostess was obligated to pay Mr. Popovich when he was laid off. Those liabilities were wiped out in the bankruptcy.At a brick bakery in Schiller Park, Ill., Twinkies started rolling off the line nearly a century ago. And when Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s cake plants and brands out of bankruptcy in 2013, Schiller Park\u2019s plant was one of the fortunate few to reopen.\u201cSchiller Park, We \u2665 You,\u201d read a billboard that Hostess sponsored in the town, the heart carved into the image of a half-eaten Twinkie.The celebration was short-lived. Just over a year after the plant\u2019s grand reopening, Hostess shut it down.The fallout was swift. All 415 employees were fired, some for the second time in two years. Schiller Park lost one of its largest employers, creating a ripple effect through this tiny working-class suburb of Chicago. The plant itself, an institution so old that it predated nearby O\u2019Hare International Airport, was suddenly vacant.\u201cWe got our hopes up again,\u201d said the town\u2019s mayor, Barbara J. Piltaver. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, we had a big hit.\u201dThe story behind the rise and fall \u2014 and fall again \u2014 of the Schiller Park plant encapsulates private equity\u2019s relationship with workers and labor unions.In Schiller Park, Janice Ryan worked at the Hostess plant for about 20 years before the 2012 bankruptcy. She walked to work from her nearby home. And she was relieved to return, after several months of unemployment, to be part of what many workers believed was the company\u2019s long-term comeback.Schiller Park was a starting point for getting Twinkies back on the shelves by summer 2013. As part of that push, many Schiller Park employees worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, and could volunteer for a seventh day.\u201cWe were all proud of what we accomplished,\u201d said Michael Spina, who worked for Hostess for many years in St. Louis and then moved to Schiller Park to help manage production when the plant reopened.What the workers were never told, however, was that Apollo and Metropoulos had no plans to keep Schiller Park in operation over the long term.\u201cSchiller, in essence, was a contingency plan, opened only to ensure that initial demand could be met,\u201d Hannah Arnold, a Hostess spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added that the setup of the bakery \u2014 its low ceilings and lack of a loading dock \u2014 was not conducive to the company\u2019s future plans. The company says it could not tell workers of its plans because of labor rules.The expendability of Schiller Park reflects Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s plans to run a more efficient operation than their predecessors did. And that model requires far fewer workers than the one that existed for decades.In 2012, Hostess had about 8,000 employees and eight bakeries dedicated exclusively to snack cakes. Six other plants produced at least some desserts. Today, the new Hostess has only three plants and 1,200 workers.At Schiller Park, some workers earned a dollar less per hour than what workers were paid under the previous owners. Others earned more, the company said. Still, they qualified for bonuses, owed no union dues and received health insurance and dental care. Instead of pensions, they were enrolled in 401(k) plans.Former employees recalled grueling shifts when temperatures inside the plant neared 110 degrees. The workers were given Gatorade to rehydrate.\u201cBakeries are hot places,\u201d Mr. Spina said. \u201cBut Schiller Park could really be a hot son of a bitch.\u201dVeronica Pacheco, who lives in Schiller Park and joined the Hostess bakery when it reopened in 2013, described \u201cfreezing\u201d wintertime conditions that were equally arduous. She said she wore scarves and heavy gloves under her work garments.Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, noted that prospective employees answered a questionnaire about whether they were willing to work in \u201cextreme seasonal temperatures.\u201d The company said it spent about $100,000 upgrading the heating and air-conditioning system, but stopped short of a total overhaul.There were other hazards as well. In 2014, Todd Kemp was injured after heaps of Twinkie mix spilled on the factory floor, causing him to slip and injure his shoulder, back and knee. He has since had four operations.Ms. Arnold said Apollo and Metropoulos inherited old equipment, some of it in disrepair, adding that Schiller Park \u201cwas in the worst condition of the four bakeries by far.\u201dC. Dean Metropoulos, the billionaire Greek immigrant whose firm has invested in other well-known food brands like Vlasic pickles and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, personally oversaw the upgrading and cleaning of the facility, Ms. Arnold said.\u201cHe also focused on ensuring workers had new uniforms and better shoes, to make long days standing more comfortable,\u201d she said.Over the long term, Apollo and Metropoulos looked outside Schiller Park to generate profits.Hostess employed \u201cextended shelf-life technology\u201d to make the Twinkie, already jokingly thought to be capable of surviving nuclear war, even more everlasting.The company perfected its secret recipe until it contained the right amount of enzymes to better retain moisture. The enzymes extended shelf life of some products to 65 days from 26 days.The company also turned to automation. At a plant in Emporia, Kan., Hostess installed an automated baking system that churned out more cakes with fewer workers.William Toler, Hostess\u2019s chief executive, said the company spent more than $140 million \u201cto get the business up and running, and certainly our results suggest we made very good choices.\u201dThe Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga., had another advantage: government subsidies. The state\u2019s economic development agency provided Hostess with tax credits to push along the deal. The Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs.\u201cWe\u2019re not doing it to be nice guys, we\u2019re doing it to create jobs,\u201d said Wylly Harrison, who worked on the deal for the Georgia Department of Economic Development and said that the state was thrilled Hostess came back.Hostess said it also received incentives from Emporia, the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis. Employment totals at those plants have since increased.Hostess did not receive any incentives in Illinois.Three workers interviewed by The Times said they believed that the final straw for Schiller Park was when they voted to rejoin a union.Hostess fought the effort. The company plastered the plant with posters urging workers to vote \u201cno.\u201dThe union prevailed, but not for long. Around the time union officials had planned to start contract negotiations in August 2014, Hostess announced it was shutting down the Schiller Park plant.Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, said the unionization vote did not factor into the decision to close Schiller Park. Employees, she said, were provided severance and an opportunity to apply for a Hostess job in another state.Union officials declined to comment.Since then, unions have made limited inroads at Hostess. Whereas 83 percent of the work force was unionized in 2012, Hostess recently said in a securities filing that about 30 percent of employees belonged to a union in Indianapolis and Columbus. Its flagship facility, Emporia, is not unionized.\u201cBoth Apollo and Metropoulos have owned and operated numerous companies that had union employees,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, adding that \u201cMetropoulos has always enjoyed good, working relations with unions and their members.\u201dFor all the profits Apollo and Metropoulos squeezed out of the Hostess factories, a deal hatched in a hotel room on Fifth Avenue in New York shows how private equity can have its snack cake and eat it, too.There, in the Versailles Room at the St. Regis, Apollo and Metropoulos began the process of extracting returns from the company, less than a year after shutting the Schiller Park plant.Most investors seeking profit have to wait for the right moment to sell a company or take it public. But private equity uses a different playbook.First, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for Hostess to borrow money from the banking giant Credit Suisse. The two firms then pocketed about $900 million of that money for themselves and their investors. Hostess, meanwhile, is stuck repaying the debt.This type of deal is known as a dividend recapitalization, and it is a staple of private equity\u2019s money-making strategy. These deals provide private equity firms an opportunity to profit before they even sell a company, an added bonus to the firms and their investors, including public pensioners.Since 2012, private equity firms have arranged hundreds of such deals, totaling over $148 billion in debt, according to Thomson Reuters. Hostess\u2019s dividend deal was the third largest of 2015.This financial engineering is crucial to private equity\u2019s success \u2014 and to building the personal fortunes of the industry\u2019s executives. With each dividend recapitalization, more money pours into Apollo, which then flows to the firm\u2019s executives.It comes with risks. Of all the companies that carried out dividend recapitalizations since 2012, about 10 percent have faced a credit rating downgrade within six months of the deal, according to LCD/S&P Global Market Intelligence and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings, which notes that many factors could lead to a downgrade, including excessive debt.Although Hostess has not been downgraded, it now describes itself in public filings as \u201chighly leveraged.\u201dMr. Toler, the Hostess chief, said that even after the dividend payout, the company \u201chad plenty of capital to work with.\u201dAt the same time it was paying dividends to investors, Hostess earmarked $8 million to pay bonuses to workers, including those in the bakeries.And still, they arranged more ways to profit. Apollo and Metropoulos retained a combined 42 percent stake in the company, which is now publicly traded.After investing only $186 million in cash when they bought the company in 2013 (they took out debt to help finance the rest of the $410 million deal), Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s investment is now worth 13 times that initial cash investment.Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black\u2019s pocket is a byzantine task.Mr. Black collected a $100,000 salary and no bonus in 2015.How did Mr. Black, on such a relatively modest salary, come to acquire an art collection that is said to include one of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201c Scream\u201d series, which he bought in 2012 for about $120 million, then the highest price ever paid for a painting?The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries.Mr. Black\u2019s share of the Hostess profits, from the partial sale and the $900 million in cash they pulled out of the company, will be reflected in a series of distributions he collects from Apollo\u2019s publicly traded stock. The size of the distribution depends on the size of the profits from deals like Hostess.Last year, Mr. Black\u2019s distributions totaled $181 million.Other shareholders in Apollo \u2014 which include money managers like Fidelity \u2014 also receive these distributions. But Mr. Black, as the largest shareholder of a company he co-founded in 1990, gets the largest payout.While Mr. Black receives the most money at Apollo, one of his partners and co-founders, Joshua Harris, took home $121 million last year. Mr. Harris is part owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils.Mr. Black has noted that if Apollo\u2019s investments fail to make money, then its executives also miss out.Like most private equity firms, Apollo collects a management fee from investors and earns 20 percent of profits from the firm\u2019s investments, once its investors recoup their original money and reap profits of their own.Private equity\u2019s advantages don\u2019t end there. Apollo\u2019s share of the profits on Hostess or any deal ultimately flows to Mr. Black and his fellow shareholders in the company in ways that lower their tax burden.The industry\u2019s 20 percent cut of profits \u2014 also known as carried interest \u2014 is taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is roughly half the 40 percent ordinary income rate for the nation\u2019s highest earners. And since private equity executives receive much of their money from carried interest \u2014 or in the case of Mr. Black, distributions largely made up of carried interest \u2014 they enjoy a tax advantage over workers.This is what\u2019s known as the \u201ccarried-interest loophole\u201d \u2014 a tax treatment held up during the presidential campaign as evidence that the rich fail to pay their fair share.Private equity managers argue that this treatment is not a loophole or even unique to private equity. Its use originated from the cut of profits that ship captains reaped for \u201ccarrying\u201d goods.In the Hostess deal, Apollo and Metropoulos found even more ways to use the tax code to their advantage.The firms are entitled to collect a large portion of tax benefits that Hostess could earn well into the future. The idea is that by selling a stake in Hostess before they could realize these benefits, Apollo and Metropoulos could leave money on the table.These arrangements, which are now commonplace in private deals, allow the firms to collect cash from a company they may no longer own.The Hostess \u201ctax-receivable\u201d benefits, according to previously unreported securities filings and estimates by the Apollo spokesman, could provide Apollo and Metropoulos up to $400 million for the next 15 years or more.Looking out over those next 15 years, nothing seems guaranteed to Mr. Popovich, the former Hostess worker from Toledo. Right before Thanksgiving, Mr. Popovich was laid off from his most recent job at the solar panel plant.The idea of searching for work at age 58 is daunting. He has been sending out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but has not received a call back.\u201cIt\u2019s been four jobs in four years,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we go again.\u201dLeslie Picker, Kitty Bennett and Sara Olkon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Barbizet will become vice chairwoman and will remain chief executive of the Art\u00e9mis Group, the investment company founded by Mr. Pinault.Mr. Cerutti, 50, is taking over at a time when the auction houses are struggling to fill their sales with inventory, given a hesitation among sellers to consign their prize artworks in light of political and economic uncertainty.\u201cThe demand is very strong and has remained very strong from new buyers and emerging buyers,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said. \u201cThe supply side is more challenging. We have to be ready to face this part of the cycle because we know we are in a cyclical business.\u201d Mr. Cerutti\u2019s experience in Asia will be important at a time when the region is the focus of increasing attention as fertile ground for new buyers.

The company is not required to report profitability on its sales, which can carry large guarantees, or promised minimum prices.But Mr. Cerutti said that he had confidence in the remaining team, which includes Stephen Brooks as deputy chief executive and Jussi Pylkkanen as global president \u2014 and was pleased that Mr. Gorvy would continue to work closely with Christie\u2019s from the outside.\u201cBrett is a great individual but he was also a member of the team and the team remains in place,\u201d Mr. Cerutti said, \u201cI\u2019m confident they will take over.\u201dMs. Barbizet ran Christie\u2019s from Europe, where she lives in Paris.

{"Headline": "How the Fed\u2019s Interest Rate Increase Can Affect You", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byEconomists talk a lot about the impact this will have on markets, but what about everyday consumers?The Fed\u2019s decision can affect the cost of housing, cars, student loans and even the interest on your credit card \u2014 though not all necessarily right away. And when the Fed raises rates, all sorts of other expenses eventually tick up.\u201cThe bottom line, ostensibly, is that the economy is getting stronger,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cNobody in their right mind would say, \u2018I\u2019d rather have higher unemployment and lower interest rates.\u2019 Nobody wants to pay a higher interest rate, but I think that\u2019s an easy choice for most people.\u201dIn general, movement of the Fed\u2019s rate does not have a large, direct impact on long-term mortgage rates. But when the Fed\u2019s rate goes up, banks find ways to pass their higher borrowing costs along to consumers.The average interest rate on a mortgage this month is 4.3 percent, according to LendingTree, and the average loan on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is worth about $237,000. If the borrowing rate were to rise by, say, another percentage point in the coming year, this would mean an additional $138 a month on the average mortgage \u2014 leading to nearly $50,000 in added interest over the duration of the loan.As mortgage rates go up, people are a little less likely to buy a house, and those with fixed-rate mortgages are less likely to refinance (because they probably will not end up with a better deal).An interesting wrinkle is that as a result, volume \u2014 that is, the amount of new mortgage contracts being issued \u2014 goes down. So brokers could also start loosening their requirements for new mortgages.The annual percentage rate on your credit card can be anywhere from 15 percent to 20 percent \u2014 much higher than the interest rate on a mortgage or a car loan.An uptick in the Fed\u2019s interest rate might cause your credit card\u2019s A.P.R., if it\u2019s variable as opposed to fixed at a specific rate, to bounce by one or two percentage points. The effects of that can be larger than they may initially seem, in part because the interest compounds. That is, you begin to pay interest on what you owe and the interest that you have been accumulating on that.\u201cIf you\u2019re accumulating credit card debt for a year,\u201d said Markus K. Brunnermeier, a Princeton economist, \u201cmoving from 13 percent interest to 15 percent is a much bigger deal than moving something from 1 percent to 3 percent.\u201dRates for student loans, like other forms of borrowing, are at a relative low. But as the Fed\u2019s rate rises, that will change for those just starting to think about paying for college.Federal loans are tied to the 10-year Treasury rate, which factors in the Fed\u2019s anticipated interest rates over the coming decade. Because these rates are projected to tick up steadily by the Fed\u2019s own forecasts, students planning to take out loans in the next few years can expect the government\u2019s student loan rates to rise.\u201cStudents taking out new debt will be looking at higher payments,\u201d Dr. Baker said, adding that he expected rates could rise by one or two percentage points in the next few years.Rates for car loans, too, are already climbing in response to the Fed\u2019s expected move. Auto loans tend to last only a few years, so there is still time for car buyers to get ahead of the curve.That\u2019s because the Fed, in its most recent economic projection, predicted that interest rates will continue climbing into the next decade. A few years from now, a car loan issued in 2017 could be fully paid off, and interest rates may still be on the rise.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of buying it now or in two years\u2019 time, you should buy it now,\u201d Dr. Brunnermeier said.What about renters? An interest-rate increase may also affect them \u2014 just not as directly.Higher rates mean that landlords must pay more to purchase and renovate their properties, so in the long run, those are costs they could easily pass on to renters \u2014 though it\u2019s not necessarily a given that it will happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Donald Trump\u2019s Tough Talk to Create Real Jobs", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAmericans are ready for an economic nationalist to lead them. But that doesn\u2019t mean what you might think.This country, we are taught, was founded on the principles of individualism and free enterprise. But its rise to economic pre-eminence was set in motion by nationalists like Alexander Hamilton, who delivered America\u2019s first industrial policy, including plans for tariffs and spending on roads. Henry Clay\u2019s American System, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s land-grant research universities and Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal can all be counted as legacies of Hamilton\u2019s vision.Thanks to these leaders\u2019 pragmatism, the United States became the world\u2019s industrial powerhouse and, spurred by the rise of trade unions, built a prosperous middle class. That provided a foundation for economic and political stability in a rapidly changing world.But since 2000, the United States has shed almost one-third of its manufacturing jobs, and millions of Americans have been permanently shuffled into work for the service industry. Some jobs vanished because of automation, but many were also lost because of a flood of Chinese imports.And Mr. Trump can\u2019t simply tweet back into existence every factory job that has disappeared. A pragmatic economic nationalism \u2014 one not hobbled by a philosophy, and one that can imagine an economy that will work even for its forgotten corners \u2014 offers solutions.First, we need to negotiate a new manufacturing deal with China to end its trade war on the United States. We need to reduce Chinese imports and end China\u2019s lingering practice of manipulating its currency to help its businesses.We are in a surprisingly strong position to make such a deal. China has a big incentive to get along with the United States: America is the destination for nearly one in five Chinese exports, making us a market China can\u2019t afford to lose. American exports to China, meanwhile, account for less than 1 percent of our gross domestic product.There are also precedents for using tariffs to back up negotiations. President Ronald Reagan imposed tariffs on Japanese semiconductors in 1987, and the Obama administration imposed tariffs on some Chinese steel earlier this year.Next, we must ensure that domestic demand is increased through direct investments in infrastructure and research. Mr. Trump in his presidential campaign said we needed at least $500 billion in new infrastructure investment. America\u2019s civil engineers would like seven times that.Third, tax breaks to manufacturers for capital expenditures could help keep factory jobs in the United States. Companies that want to build factories face high capital costs on Wall Street, largely because it\u2019s easier to turn a quick buck on the latest financial product than to make a long-term investment in a factory. If a government is going to offer tax breaks, it makes sense to direct them to the manufacturing sector, which can support a larger number of well-paying jobs.This is about a resurgent manufacturing sector that is in the interest of both workers and businesses. Its success will ultimately strengthen America\u2019s middle class, where the bulk of our national wealth once resided. It can again.Scott N. Paul is the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonprofit labor-business advocacy organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mother Nature Is Brought to You By ...", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThis year, parks in several states including Idaho and Washington, and the National Park Service, will be blazing a new trail, figuratively at least, as they begin offering opportunities to advertisers within their borders.King County already partnered with Chipotle to hide 30 giant replica burritos on parkland bearing the logo of the agency and the restaurant chain. People who found the burritos won prizes from Chipotle.The logic behind these efforts is, in its own way, unimpeachable. Many millions of people \u2014 that is, \u201cgreen consumers\u201d \u2014 visit parks every day, representing an unrealized marketing opportunity of great value. Yes, parks are meant to be natural, not commercial, but times are tough, or so say the backers of the new schemes.The spread of advertising to natural settings is just a taste of what\u2019s coming. Over the next decade, prepare for a new wave of efforts to reach some of the last remaining bastions of peace, quiet and individual focus \u2014 like schools, libraries, churches and even our homes.Some of this reflects technological change, but the real reason is the business model of what I call the \u201cattention merchants.\u201d Unlike ordinary businesses, which sell a product, attention merchants sell people to advertisers. They do so either by finding captive audiences (like at a park or school) or by giving stuff away to gather up consumer data for resale.Once upon a time, this was a business model largely restricted to television and newspapers, where it remained within certain limits. Over the last decade, though, it has spread to nearly every new technology, and started penetrating spaces long thought inviolate.Nor are our workplaces and social spheres immune. The time and energy we spend socializing with friends and family has, almost incredibly, been harnessed for marketing, through the business models of Facebook, Instagram and other social media. At the office, the most successful of the productivity-killing distraction engines, BuzzFeed, brags of luring a \u201cbored at work\u201d network hundreds of millions strong.Unfortunately, there is worse yet to come: The nation\u2019s most talented engineers now apply themselves to making marketing platforms out of innovations \u2014 A.I. assistants like the Amazon Echo or self-driving cars. Here the intrusions will be subtle, even disguised, so as not to trip our defenses, but they will be even more powerful, going after our very decision-making processes. Consider how much we already depend on Siri or Google Maps: What happens when our most trusted tools have mixed motives?Advertising revenue often seems like \u201cfree money,\u201d but there are enormous risks for the character of any institution once it begins to rely heavily on advertising income. History and logic suggest that, once advertisers become a major funding source, they create their own priorities, and unless carefully controlled they will warp the underlying space to serve their interests.This development raises questions beyond the mere issue of how annoying ads can be. The model of individual liberty and a self-reliant citizenry was proposed by the founders and influenced by philosophers like John Stuart Mill, who envisioned sufficient time and space for self-development of character and room for making decisions that are truly ours.Similar ideas about the prerequisite of free will are to be found in the great spiritual traditions, which sanctify certain times and spaces for the sake of our spiritual development.These ideals are threatened by a way of doing business that by its nature seeks to invade the most sanctified of spaces.If you don\u2019t like the sound of this future, resistance is not futile \u2014 it is necessary. A commercial dystopia can be averted only by private resistance and principled decisions by the leaders of institutions.The first simply requires redrawing the lines that have been eroded. Where once upon a time, tradition or religion drew those lines for us, blocking out times for family and faith, nowadays personal or family initiative are required to define parts of our lives as off limits. The default setting will always be intrusion and distraction. We need to flip the switch.The second should be to reduce the attention economy by patronizing businesses or institutions with subscription models or those that keep advertising within reasonable limits.Third, the leaders of schools, libraries and even the more principled technology firms should understand that there is always a hidden cost to the proposition offered by advertising. Once an institution is dependent on ad revenue, it\u2019s impossible to put the Crest 3D White Radiant Mint toothpaste back in the tube.Above all, we should not simply resign ourselves to a world saturated by commercial appeals at the cost of our private and sacred spaces. As the great legal scholar Charles Black Jr. once put it, \u201cI tremble for the sanity of a society that talks, on the level of abstract principle, of the precious integrity of the individual mind, and all the while, on the level of concrete fact, forces the individual mind to spend a good part of every day under bombardment with whatever some crowd of promoters want to throw at it.\u201dTim Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A decade back, being seen in a Prius was tr\u00e8s chic. Now, with gasoline cheaper than bottled water, Americans are accessorizing their driveways with S.U.V.s and crossovers.The segment might be fashion-forward, but as a whole it\u2019s a thirsty bunch. Nissan\u2019s Rogue, however, already among the most fuel-efficient in its segment, just became stingier with a gallon of gas with the arrival of a new hybrid model. The cars are expected to reach dealers late this month or early in January.Compact sport utes are extremely popular, but only Rogue and Toyota\u2019s RAV4 run with a gas/electric powertrain. Subaru rejected that version of the XV Crosstrek recently and Ford hasn\u2019t made a hybrid Escape in years.A splash of cold water first: Neither RAV nor Rogue deliver Prius\u2019s 50-mile-per-gallon frugality. Then again, they don\u2019t look like a Prius either. Hey, fashion is important. You\u2019re not wearing a Members Only jacket anymore. Are you?Nissan thinks that when the Rogue Hybrid\u2019s official Environmental Protection Agency numbers are released, the all-wheel-drive version I drove will snag a rating of 31 miles per gallon city and 34 highway, which is what I saw in a week of driving. Averaging 33 m.p.g., it is only 6 m.p.g. better than a standard Rogue and bests the RAV4 Hybrid by a whisker (though the Toyota wins in the city cycle).Nissan\u2019s hybrid system starts with a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with a 30kW electric motor for 176 total horsepower. A unique setup employs two clutches, one between the gas engine and electric motor (effectively standing in for the torque converter) and a second between the motor and a continuously variable transmission.Generally, turning existing vehicles into hybrids cannibalizes the trunk. Rogue\u2019s lithium-ion battery pack occupies the space where in gasoline models an optional third row of seating can go \u2014 although those seats are best suited to kindergartners or people even smaller. But the battery housing raises the load floor only a smidgen, so cargo space remains much the same.Motors and batteries add 180 pounds, but the torquey electric motor offers sufficient grunt off the line to keep it as quick as the gas-only model. Going from 0 to 60 miles an hour in nine seconds doesn\u2019t set land speed records, but the Rogue Hybrid feels spunky bopping about town. The suspension is dialed toward the comfy side. So, predictably, there\u2019s some body roll in hard maneuvers.The hybrid system\u2019s operation is as smooth as the ride. But stomp on the throttle and there\u2019s a lag before the powertrain gets the urgent message. Seems to me it\u2019s those two clutches trying to figure how to divide power. In normal driving, though, it\u2019s not an issue.Brake pedal modulation between power regeneration (which charges the battery) and the physical disc brakes transitions gracefully. An LCD display shows where the power is coming from or going to, and a needle in the gauge cluster encourages a light throttle touch. With a well-charged battery, Rogue can skulk around the neighborhood under purely electrical power for two minutes at speeds under 25 miles per hour. It\u2019s not something I understand, but by all means have fun.All 2017 Rogues, hybrid or not, have received a solid freshening. The front has an even bolder version of Nissan\u2019s V-Motion grille and the back gets a slight nip and tuck.The cabin updates are more noticeable, dressed up with a steering wheel that is flattened at the bottom (you rogue you!) plus cut-and-sewn instrument panel sections. Top-tier SL models can be had with a safety technology package of autobraking with pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control. At $2,800, the tech is worth every penny if it prevents just one bad encounter. And that package throws in a panoramic glass roof.My adult friends never complained about legroom in the fixed rear seat. There\u2019s no power port or heated cushion option to pamper them, though.When Rogue Hybrid hits dealerships, expect a price premium of $1,000. I would estimate my fully optioned SL AWD tester in the $36,000 range. A front-drive model should be available for under 30K.Rogue Hybrid offers the form factor buyers want these days along with good fuel economy. And efficiency is always in fashion.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White Resentment on the Night Shift at Walmart", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byOpinionSeven years ago, I joined the night shift at a Walmart in rural Michigan. For $8.10 an hour, I spent four or five nights a week filling shelves with the flour and sugar and marshmallow fluff that residents of the local county, which in 2008 voted for Barack Obama, needed to get through the holidays. Four years ago, the county went with President Obama a second time, though by a thinner margin. But this past November, the county, like the state, turned red.A few shifts into my time on Walmart\u2019s sales floor, I spent a smoke break outside in the damp November air with a co-worker, a white single mother of four. We squatted on a concrete curb in the gray cast of parking-lot lights and surveyed what lay before us. Walmart\u2019s expanse of asphalt, dotted with worn-out pickups and domestic sedans, gave way to a road lined with strip malls and dollar stores. Beyond it, a sign for Meijer, a regional competitor to Walmart, glowed red against a black sky.If she made it to 15 years at Walmart, which was common among workers on our shift, she said she\u2019d even get to keep her employee discount card \u2014 which offered 10 percent off produce and other items \u2014 for life. As I talked to other co-workers, nearly all of whom were white, I got the impression that Walmart wasn\u2019t necessarily considered a good job, but it was one of the best jobs in town. At least it wasn\u2019t going to up and move to Mexico, the way factories had.I was on that night shift at Walmart for a couple months undercover, chronicling my work for a book on America\u2019s food system. But while I was there I also got a good look at how things had changed for folks in Michigan. I don\u2019t remember my single-mom co-worker saying anything about that directly, but the way she talked about that discount card made me think about it a lot.I\u2019d grown up in Michigan, in a town of 10,000 people sprawled out on dirt roads and two-lane highways, attending a public school with the children of factory workers and farmers, and plenty of kids who were just plain poor. My dad sold lawn mowers, and my grandfather had worked at Ford for decades. That union job had helped put two kids through college and given my grandparents a decent enough retirement. They\u2019d had, as much as anyone else, the American dream. It was hard to see how my co-workers would get there.From my reporter\u2019s perspective, I could see similarities between the lives of the people I spent the night shift with and those of folks I\u2019d met covering poverty in New York City: Unpredictable work schedules damaging health and home life; no dependable child care wreaking havoc on work; transportation and health care so tenuous that basic household functions like grocery shopping and doctor\u2019s appointments fell by the wayside; wages that almost never matched expenses.For all the variations that race and geography produced, there was a sameness to the tone of life for everyone I met who was working class, which usually meant they worked but were still poor.Still, there was a bitterness among my Walmart colleagues and, if I was honest, I heard echoes of it in myself that I never encountered reporting on New York\u2019s working class and poor, who were mostly black and brown.Nobody I worked with had the luxury of my aerial view. They had high school diplomas and uncertain futures, and no easy explanation for why the dream didn\u2019t work out for them.If being white made life so much easier, the thinking seemed to go, why was it still so hard? The ready-made answers that are front and center in our culture \u2014 a rigged system, new workers taking jobs, corrupt politicians \u2014 are a big part of what put Donald J. Trump in office.At its ugliest, whites\u2019 resentment is channeled along race lines, often toward groups that many white people believe compete against them for resources \u2014 or don\u2019t deserve resources at all. Grappling with this idea of who deserves benefits is a longstanding, difficult conversation.I have no idea how or whether my co-workers from Walmart voted. But the county I worked in saw an increase in voter turnout of about 2,500 this year. If that all went to Mr. Trump, it accounts for a little more than one-fifth of his margin of victory in Michigan.During one of my training days, a tall, red-mustachioed loss-prevention manager addressed our group of trainees. He informed us we were being watched closely for theft on the job, and then took stock of what our future options might be. There were, he said, many career paths available at Walmart: store management, corporate lawyer, bomb-sniffing-dog handler. Then he reminded us of the biggest benefit our new employer offered: \u201cYou can be with Walmart forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Clinton Aides Clash During Election Forum", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Top strategists from the campaigns of Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, interrupting each other and sometimes raising their voices, engaged in an angry debate on Thursday about how Mr. Trump pulled off his upset victory.Emotions were still raw at the campaign post-mortem, held at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, particularly over the influence of Stephen K. Bannon, who left Breitbart News \u2014 which he has called a \u201cplatform\u201d for the white nationalist alt-right \u2014 to help run Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Mr. Bannon will serve as a senior aide to Mr. Trump. David Bossie, Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, called Mr. Bannon a \u201cbrilliant strategist.\u201dThat provoked the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri, to respond, \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am more proud to have lost.\u201dWith campaign managers and pollsters talking over one another and a large crowd of campaign veterans from the news media looking on, Ms. Palmieri said her proudest moment from the campaign was a speech Mrs. Clinton gave in Nevada condemning the alt-right.\u201cI would rather lose than win the way you guys did,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said.Kellyanne Conway, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s third and final campaign manager, asked, \u201cHow exactly did we win?\u201dShe answered her own question: by connecting with voters in places \u201cwhere we were either ignored or mocked roundly by most of the people in this room.\u201d\u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Ms. Conway asked Ms. Palmieri. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look me in the face and tell me that?\u201dMs. Conway went on, pointing out Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failings. \u201cDo you think you could have just had a decent message for the white working-class voters?\u201d she asked the Clinton advisers. \u201cHow about it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, she doesn\u2019t connect with people? How about they had nothing in common with her? How about you had no economic message?\u201dDonald J. Trump made good on his strategy of stoking the enthusiasm of white voters to defeat Hillary Clinton.Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pollster, accused the Trump campaign of using \u201cdog whistles\u201d about immigrants and minorities to appeal to white voters in battleground states. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, disputed the notion that Mr. Trump won primarily by appealing on economic issues, citing exit polls in Michigan and Wisconsin showing Mrs. Clinton carried more voters who ranked the economy as their top issue.The highly charged exchange was followed by a more restrained conversation between Ms. Conway and Mr. Mook, moderated by the CNN host Jake Tapper. CNN will broadcast the discussion on Sunday.But it was the more raucous session earlier in the day where the passions of the campaign still seemed at a barely contained boil.The participants, half a dozen from each campaign who faced each other while seated at two tables, argued about whether Mr. Trump had won a mandate. \u201cYou won the Electoral College; don\u2019t pretend you have a mandate,\u201d Mr. Benenson said. \u201cTwo and a half million more Americans thought she was a better candidate.\u201d\u201cHey guys,\u201d Ms. Conway replied. \u201cWe won. Why is there no mandate?\u201dIn a rare point of agreement, both campaigns faulted the news media. They said leading newspapers and TV networks were so convinced Mr. Trump was unelectable that they never took him seriously. That led to \u201chyper-fixation\u201d on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, Mr. Mook said.\u201cMr. Trump had a unique ability to speak directly to the American people and go past the media, whether in 140 characters or making a statement somewhere,\u201d Mr. Bossie said.The Trump strategists repeatedly said the Clinton campaign had tried to disqualify Mr. Trump based on his temperament and statements, while misunderstanding the appeal of his promise to keep Americans safe from terrorism at home and abroad.\u201cThey wanted to frame the race as, \u2018Do you trust him to have his finger on the button?\u2019\u201d said Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Trump\u2019s pollster.\u201cAt the end of the day, what a lot of voters didn\u2019t buy was that it was ever going to be a time where you have to worry about his finger on the button,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t Barry Goldwater.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the president-elect, so that\u2019s presidential behavior,\u201d she said.At one point, Ms. Conway threw up her hands in frustration at the close scrutiny of the campaign. \u201cEverybody wants to go back in a time machine and do things differently so this result that nobody saw coming won\u2019t come somehow,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Chaos Theory: A Single Tweet Causes Jobs to Return", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump spent much of his campaign peddling hope to beleaguered working-class Americans that, on his watch, those old-fashioned, good-paying manufacturing jobs would come back to America.On Thursday, the president-elect was in Indiana to celebrate the news that the Carrier Corporation will move only 1,300 jobs to Mexico, not 2,100 as planned. That\u2019s not bringing jobs back to the United States; they are just leaving more slowly.Manufacturing employment in the United States peaked at 19.6 million in June 1979; today, 12.3 million Americans work in factories. Even during the economic recovery, amid proclamations of a renaissance in American manufacturing, production jobs barely grew. So far in 2016, they have fallen by 62,000, even as 1.8 million new jobs were created.The lesson: You can\u2019t fight a vast tide with a Twitter account.To some degree, trade liberalization \u2014 including those deals that Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders railed against \u2014 has encouraged countries like China to engage in anti-competitive practices. But the vast preponderance of American job losses has come simply because emerging-market countries have gotten much better at making stuff with workers earning far less.In 2015, a typical factory employee in the United States earned $37.71 an hour, including benefits; his Mexican counterpart received $5.90 an hour. And American executives say that the productivity that they get in Mexico is at least as good as what they get in the United States.No wonder then that Mexico currently has a booming auto sector. Between 2007 and 2015, employment in the Mexican auto sector grew to 558,000 from 405,000, while auto jobs in the United States declined to 762,000 from 828,000.Mr. Trump\u2019s recent proclamation that he kept a Ford plant in Kentucky from closing was a mirage \u2014 Ford never planned to shutter the plant or eliminate any positions. More significantly, Ford is still going forward with the construction of a $1.6 billion facility in Mexico to assemble small cars, which cannot be done profitably using expensive American labor.All told, Ford and General Motors plan to invest a combined $9.1 billion in Mexican facilities and hire 12,200 more workers over the next four years. By 2020, analysts project that about 40 percent of small cars sold by the Detroit automakers will be made in Mexico, more than double current levels.Against that backdrop, I don\u2019t see how the Carrier experience \u2014 even in its imperfect state \u2014 can be replicated.For one thing, Carrier was apparently promised $7 million over 10 years in state tax incentives. It\u2019s simply not realistic for Mr. Trump (or anyone) to run around the country subsidizing manufacturing jobs at high costs.For another, Carrier\u2019s parent corporation, United Technologies, garners about 10 percent of its revenues from Pentagon contracts, making the company particularly receptive to a president-elect.And, of course, Mr. Trump\u2019s mouth-to-mouth combat can do little to address the equally important problem of wages. Thanks to pressure from low-wage countries, average hourly earnings for manufacturing workers in Indiana have dropped to $19.20 from $23.70 in 2003, after adjusting for inflation.Beyond using political tactics, Mr. Trump wants to pursue his campaign agenda of renegotiating trade deals and imposing high tariffs once he has his hands on the levers of power. Higher import duties would hurt the very people Mr. Trump is trying to help. Thanks to trade, prices of many goods have fallen. In the decade between 2002 and 2012, the prices of toys dropped by 43 percent and those of furniture and bedding fell by 7 percent.All told, one study of 40 countries found that if international trade ended, the wealthiest consumers would lose 28 percent of their purchasing power while those in the bottom tenth, who typically rely on more imported goods, would lose 63 percent. Sure, a small number of manufacturing jobs would return, but at an extraordinary price.Let\u2019s instead focus on a sensible economic plan to help those Trump voters who are hurting.For starters, the president-elect is correct that more logical tax policies need to be pursued; our loophole-ridden corporate tax code encourages American companies to move abroad. And yes, some regulations hurt our competitiveness.But his solutions (like huge tax cuts for the rich) smack of giveaways to capitalists rather than effective ways to help blue-collar workers in Michigan. More useful measures would be to raise the just 0.1 percent of our gross domestic product we spend on retraining workers, one-sixth of the average of other wealthy countries.Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities seem to be elsewhere; Republican plans to slash federal spending would reduce the help Washington gives struggling workers.That highlights the conundrum of Trumponomics: He is offering an economic plan devoid of policies that would help the voters who elected him.Because of an editing error, an Op-Ed essay on Friday about Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to keep jobs in the United States misstated the change in auto sector employment in both the United States and Mexico between 2007 and 2015. In Mexico, jobs grew to 558,000 from 405,000, not to 675,000 from 174,000. In the United States, auto jobs declined to 762,000 from 828,000. The article also misstated plans by Detroit car companies in Mexico. Ford and General Motors plan to invest a combined $9.1 billion and hire 12,200 more workers; Detroit car companies are not planning to invest $30 billion and hire 30,000 more workers.Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, is a longtime Wall Street executive who served as lead auto adviser in the Obama Administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economics of Regional Self-Esteem", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Donald Trump won the electoral college at least in part by promising to bring coal jobs back to Appalachia and manufacturing jobs back to the Rust Belt. Neither promise can be honored \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the most part we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about jobs lost, not to unfair foreign competition, but to technological change. But a funny thing happens when people like me try to point that out: we get enraged responses from economists who feel an affinity for the working people of the afflicted regions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 responses that assume that trying to do the numbers must reflect contempt for regional cultures, or something.[T]he track record of regional support policies in other countries, which spend far more on such things than we are likely to, is pretty poor. For example, massive aid to the former East Germany hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevented a large decline in population, much bigger than the population decline in Appalachia over the same period.Krugman and those who believe him want to believe that the fears of Appalachians (or Rust Belters, or what have you) are overblown, that life has not been so bad for them as it seems.Wait; did I say that? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so. In fact, if I thought everything was OK in Appalachia, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have used it as a comparator for Eastern Germany. The point was precisely that Appalachia is a byword for regional decline, which makes it striking that East Germany, which has received the kind of aid Appalachia can only dream of, is suffering an even faster demographic decline. And for what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent decades writing and talking about the problems of rising inequality and stagnant wages, so characterizing me as someone telling workers that their problems exist only in their heads is pretty strange.Now, if we want to have a discussion of regional policies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an argument to the effect that my pessimism is unwarranted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 fine. As someone who is generally a supporter of government activism, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d actually like to be convinced that a judicious program of subsidies, relocating government departments, whatever, really can sustain communities whose traditional industry has eroded. But what we get instead is an immediate attack on motives. Apparently even suggesting that the decline in some kinds of traditional employment can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reversed, and that sustaining regional economies can be hard, is a demonstration of elitist contempt for regular people. You might think that people like me are potential allies for those who want to help working families, wherever they are. But if we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything without facing the hair-trigger tempers of regional advocates, without being accused of insulting their culture, that pretty much forecloses useful discussion.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Subdued Vladimir Putin Calls for \u2018Mutually Beneficial\u2019 Ties With U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byThe Russian leader appeared remarkably subdued at what was widely seen as a moment of triumph for him, with his popularity rising on a cresting wave of anti-establishment and often pro-Russian populism in Europe and America.He lamented that around the world, \u201ceven in the most seemingly affluent countries and stable regions, more and more fractures and conflicts on political, ethnic, religious and social grounds are rising.\u201dThose remarks had to surprise Western officials who have frequently accused the Kremlin of stirring up and supporting precisely those anti-establishment forces so as to sow disorder and weaken liberal democracies. Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, warned in an interview published on Tuesday that Russia, seeking to create \u201cpolitical uncertainty,\u201d was bombarding his country with disinformation before elections next year.Mr. Putin did not mention Mr. Trump by name, saying only that Russia wanted to work with the incoming administration \u201cto normalize and begin to develop bilateral relations on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.\u201dHis comments largely reprised the message he gave Mr. Trump in a telephone call soon after the Nov. 8 election, when both men agreed that something needed to be done to improve \u201cthe absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations.\u201dIn a departure from his speeches in recent years, Mr. Putin avoided sarcastic or downright angry comments about the United States. But he also made clear that Russia demanded to be treated as a global power, not the \u201cregional power\u201d that Mr. Obama described it as in 2014, infuriating Moscow.\u201cWe have a joint responsibility for the provision of international security and stability, for the strengthening of anti-proliferation regimes,\u201d Mr. Putin said, referring to efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump suggested that more countries should acquire nuclear weapons so that they can defend themselves without Washington\u2019s help. He also threatened to dismantle the international agreement that limits Iran\u2019s nuclear program.In another apparent reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign statements on nuclear weapons policy, which included assertions that the American arsenal had \u201cfallen way behind\u201d Russia\u2019s and needed to catch up, Mr. Putin warned against any attempt by Washington to disrupt what he called the balance of nuclear firepower between the two countries.\u201cI would like to emphasize that attempts to break strategic parity are extremely dangerous and can lead to a global catastrophe,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cThis must not be forgotten for a single second.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s mixing of pointed reminders of Russia\u2019s status as a nuclear power with a measured expression of hope for an end to the current deep chill in relations with Washington contrasted sharply with the unalloyed glee expressed by many Russian politicians and commentators after Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory. In the run-up to the election, state-controlled news outlets cast Hillary Clinton as a Russophobic hawk and warmonger while Mr. Trump was presented as the candidate who would bring a new and sunny dawn to relations between Washington and Moscow.Syria and the importance of fighting Islamic extremism are areas in which Mr. Putin\u2019s interests and Mr. Trump\u2019s statements seem to coincide. Mr. Putin, who has repeatedly accused the Obama administration of mollycoddling extremists, said the United States needed to focus on \u201ca real rather than dreamt-up threat\u201d and join Russia in fighting international terrorism.The \u201cdreamt-up\u201d threat seemed to refer to fear in Washington and many European capitals that Russia has become a menace to security since it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supported pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.Ignoring American efforts to destroy the Islamic State, Mr. Putin said the problem of international terrorism \u201cis being solved by our servicemen in Syria,\u201d where Russian warplanes have helped President Bashar al-Assad regain control of large sections of Aleppo, once Syria\u2019s biggest city, from rebels, some of whom are supported by the United States.A new foreign policy doctrine signed by Mr. Putin on Thursday underscored the problems with Russia\u2019s relations with the West and set a high bar for any swift easing of tensions. The doctrine, a summary of how Moscow sees the world and what it wants, stressed the gravity of \u201cthe serious crisis between Russia and the West\u201d and blamed this on \u201cgeopolitical expansion\u201d by NATO and the European Union. It said Russia and the United States could work together only on the basis of \u201cequality, mutual respect for interests and noninterference in the internal affairs of each other.\u201dInsisting that Russia does \u201cnot accept any attempts to organize pressure, either military, political, economic or of any other kind,\u201d the policy doctrine said Moscow \u201creserves the right to react hard to unfriendly actions, including through the strengthening of national defense and the taking of reciprocal or asymmetrical measures.\u201dMost of Mr. Putin\u2019s hourlong speech, however, was devoted to domestic issues, not foreign relations. He acknowledged that two years of economic decline had brought great hardship but insisted this had only made the country stronger, and he focused on sectors of the economy that he said have done well, like agriculture and high-tech.While proposing no significant reforms to revive Russia\u2019s sluggish economy \u2014 which shrank by 3.7 percent last year and has contracted further this year, though at a much slower pace \u2014 Mr. Putin said he had ordered the government to work out a \u201csubstantive action plan\u201d to ensure that Russia achieves higher growth rates than elsewhere by 2020 and elevates its position in the global economy.Russia\u2019s economy ranks around 13th in the world, on the basis of its gross domestic product, behind countries like Australia, Canada and South KoreaWhat shape such an economic development plan might take has been the object of bitter feuding between more liberal members of the government, who favor privatization, and those who want the state to keep control of crucial industries. The liberal camp suffered a major setback earlier this month with the late-night arrest on murky corruption charges of one of the country\u2019s main economic policy makers, Aleksei Ulyukaev, a liberal stalwart who had served until his arrest as minister of economic development.Mr. Putin said parliamentary elections in Russia in September, which delivered a resounding victory to his United Russia party, had \u201cproven that we live in a healthy society that is confident in its fair demands, in which immunity to populism and demagoguery is growing stronger and the importance of mutual support, solidarity and unity are highly valued.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Analytics of Trade Deficits and Manufacturing Employment (Very Wonkish)", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Still, the critique inspired me to get a bit more formal about the analytics, and there is a small clarification I think I should make.So here\u2019s how I think about it (which is actually a fairly standard trade model approach): approximate the economy as consisting of two sectors, traded and nontraded, with traded goods being basically manufacturing. Assume full employment for the sake of argument; then production is always on the production possibility frontier, which is the downward-sloping line in the figure.With balanced trade, production = consumption (plus investment, but lump them together); that\u2019s point A. When the economy runs a trade deficit, however financed, consumption lies outside the PPF, at a point like B; this point normally involves moving out an expansion path along which consumption of both nontraded and traded goods rises. However, the increase in nontraded consumption must be met out of domestic production, which means that traded production falls.So a trade deficit in manufacturing does correspond to a fall in manufacturing production.Bottom line: yes, trade deficits reduce manufacturing production and jobs. They played a significant although far from dominant role in manufacturing job losses after 2000.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

According to the report, the economy added 178,000 jobs last month. In November 2008, as Mr. Obama prepared to take office, the economy lost 769,000 jobs.The latest report also shows an unemployment rate last month of 4.6 percent and an underemployment rate of 9.3 percent. In November 2008, those were 6.8 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively.Mr. Trump should be thanking Mr. Obama and the legislators (almost exclusively Democrats) who backed Mr. Obama on fiscal stimulus, the auto bailout and health care reform, all of which laid the foundation for the improved economy that now awaits him.Instead, he is on a \u201cthank you\u201d tour, reprising his campaign themes about making America great again.The last several years have seen steady if modest growth in jobs; more recently, job growth has begun to translate into wage gains. But there is still considerable slack. The percentage of people working or actively looking for work remains at a historic low of 62.7 percent, which indicates that human capital is being wasted. At the current pace of job growth, it would take about another year for the labor market to be hitting on all cylinders.In the meantime, however, the Trump economic agenda, if enacted, will tilt conditions against working people. Mr. Trump wants to give huge tax cuts to the rich, which won\u2019t put money in workers\u2019 pockets. He wants increased spending on infrastructure, but would rely mainly on private investors rather than public financing, an approach that tends to enrich investors at the expense of the taxpayers. Taken together, those polices would increase the budget deficit, which would mean either higher national debt or deep federal spending cuts. It would be reasonable to increase the debt to boost the long-term health of the country, but tax cuts for the rich and subsidies for private investors won\u2019t do that. Federal spending cuts would harm working people because they would reduce the support the government provides directly in areas such as health, education and anti-poverty initiatives, as well as the support it supplies to the economy and society through environmental protection, scientific research, bank regulation and law enforcement.The Trump agenda, if enacted, could boost growth in the near term. But that growth would be likely to enrich those at the top of the economic ladder and leave everyone else no better off.Mr. Trump is inheriting a steady if unspectacular economy. He seems intent on transforming it into something that is spectacularly unsteady.Advertisement"}

Another, perhaps more important, explanation is that Mr. Putin has convinced them that it\u2019s not the economy, stupid, anymore.Thanks largely to the government\u2019s extensive control over information, Mr. Putin has rewritten the social contract in Russia. Long based on economic performance, it is now about geopolitical status. If economic pain is the price Russians have to pay so that Russia can stand up to the West, so be it.Russia\u2019s intervention in Crimea in early 2014 changed everything. Within two months, Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity jumped back to more than 80 percent, where it has stayed until now, despite the recession.During the 2015-16 recession, G.D.P. fell by more than 4 percent and real incomes declined by 10 percent. That is significant, but much less serious than, say, the 40 percent drop in G.D.P. that Russia experienced during the first half of the 1990s. Despite a dramatic decline in oil prices and the burden of sanctions imposed by Western governments after the Crimea crisis, the Putin administration has managed to avert economic disaster by pursuing competent macroeconomic policies.As the sanctions cut off Russia\u2019s access to global financial markets, the government set out to cover the budget deficit by undertaking major austerity measures and tapping its substantial sovereign funds. In early 2014, the Reserve Fund (created to mitigate fiscal shocks caused by drops in oil prices) and the National Welfare Fund (set up to address shortfalls in the pension system) together held the equivalent of 8 percent of G.D.P.This performance comes nowhere near meeting Mr. Putin\u2019s election-campaign promises of 2012, when he projected G.D.P. growth at 6 percent per year for 2011-18. But it isn\u2019t catastrophic either, and the government has managed to explain it away.But our model also confirmed that in all countries, democratic and nondemocratic, citizens are less likely to approve of their government if economic growth is low.So now that the recession is over and the price of oil has risen, is the social contract in Russia likely to change back to one based on economics any time soon? That seems unlikely.The current approach has served the government well enough, and it could still. Russia has become an indispensable nation in world affairs again, while managing to weather economic pressures which have now eased. At the same time, the government so far has shown little willingness to undertake the deep reforms needed to modernize and diversify the economy, and really spur growth.Sergei Guriev is the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in London.Advertisement"}

Starting with a high-profile contractor like Boeing and a highly symbolic item like Air Force One will certainly get the attention of all vendors.However, the president of the United States cannot get involved in negotiating all government purchases. A few billion dollars is a major investment for a real estate business, but it is an extremely small portion of the federal budget and should be delegated to the officials at the proper level.

Maybe it doesn\u2019t make sense to restrain the free market one corporation at a time, but rather we should consider broader policies that respond to free market failures.Can we say it?

{"Headline": "To Boost the Economy, Help Students First", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byOn CampusDonald J. Trump has made bold and provocative campaign promises on taxes, trade, immigration and infrastructure. These pledges are all in service of bolstering our economic future. While we hope these initiatives will help our economic prospects, there is one important measure missing from the debate. And it could have an even more immediate and direct impact on economic growth: student debt relief.Student debt now stands at $1.3 trillion. More than half of student borrowers are unable to repay their loans according to the original terms. In a well-intended but poorly executed effort to make college broadly accessible, the government has lent freely to students, with little attention to whether they can repay those loans. The result is millions of young people with debt they cannot afford.As a college president, I frequently hear from students who are anxious about their ability to repay their loans once they graduate. Many let student debt guide their career choices.The Department of Education has tried to provide relief through a complex web of alternative repayment plans, including those based on a borrower\u2019s income. However, these plans are limited to certain borrowers and involve a confusing array of options and bureaucratic \u201crecertification\u201d requirements, which cause a large portion of young people to lose eligibility each year. Student borrowers\u2019 balances can actually get larger as they try to pay off their obligations.Mr. Trump should scrap debt financing of higher education and make the transition to true income share arrangements. Borrowers would fulfill their obligations to taxpayers by paying a fixed percentage of their income over an extended period of years. Think of this change as a shift in the government\u2019s role from creditor to equity investor. When you lend to a business, it is obligated to pay you back with interest, but with a stock investment, your returns derive from the success of the company.Similarly, with a student loan, there is a fixed obligation to repay the loan amount with interest, but with income share, there is only a contractual obligation for the student to return to taxpayers a certain percentage of his or her future income. Higher earners will pay back more than lower earners (up to a limit), though all will have an affordable payment and all will have protection against life events \u2014 a health crisis, caring for an elderly parent \u2014 that reduce their income.Replacing the current, unwieldy programs with a single repayment plan based on income would provide immediate relief for millions of young people while guaranteeing a steady source of revenue to taxpayer coffers, particularly if payments were built into the tax withholding system. It would also provide economic stimulus, as lower payments on student debt would translate into higher consumer spending.We saw during the housing crisis how unaffordable mortgage payments weighed on our economy by reducing the amount of disposable income available to people for spending. Excessive student debt is putting the same kind of drag on our prosperity. A growing body of research has concluded that as young people cope with high monthly student debt payments, they forgo things like buying a car or a house. Many live paycheck to paycheck. Escalating defaults among student borrowers impair their credit scores, making it even more difficult to borrow for large purchases.An additional measure to ease the student debt load would be tax law changes to require colleges to spend at least 5 percent of their endowments, as is required of other nonprofits. That\u2019s what we do at Washington College. The law should also require that schools use a certain amount of this endowment spending for scholarships.We bemoan consolidation and \u201cbigness\u201d among banks and corporate America, yet the same thing has been happening in higher education, where 1 percent of four-year institutions hold more than half of all endowment wealth.Sheila C.

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo\u2019s \u2018Living Will\u2019 Plan Is Rejected Again by Regulators", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWells Fargo has run afoul of banking regulators once again: On Tuesday, for the second time this year, the bank did not pass a key regulatory test that was created after the 2008 financial crisis to reduce the threats that large banks pose to the broader economy.In April, regulators announced that they had rejected the \u201cliving will\u201d plans proposed by Wells Fargo and four other major banks. Each bank had been required to submit a plan to unwind itself in a way that would safeguard the economy in case of the bank\u2019s failure. Since then, all five banks have resubmitted their disaster-preparedness plans; only Wells Fargo\u2019s plan did not pass muster.Because of the continuing problems with Wells Fargo\u2019s plan, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will prohibit it from establishing new international units or acquiring a subsidiary that is not a bank.Those penalties can be lifted if Wells Fargo fixes its plan by March 31. Wells has until then to submit its plan a third time; if the problems linger too long, regulators could place additional limits on the company.For instance, the bank could be forced to start selling assets in certain units, including at its brokerage arm.In a statement on Tuesday, Wells Fargo said it believed it had already addressed the areas with which regulators had found fault.\u201cWe will continue to work closely with the agencies to better understand their concerns so that we can bring our resolution process in line with their expectations,\u201d the bank said.Still, the living-will issue is the latest black eye for Wells Fargo, which was only a few months ago was considered one of the nation\u2019s most well-managed banks.All the largest American banks must submit to regulators their living wills, or strategies for unwinding themselves in an orderly way \u2014 something they lacked in 2008, when the federal government had to prop up sagging banks like Citigroup and Bank of America.The living-will requirement, passed as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, is meant to prevent taxpayers from having to bail out big banks again in the event of a huge financial failure. Of all the rules passed in the wake of the crisis, this requirement is designed to address most directly the issue of big banks\u2019 being too big to fail.Banking-industry lobbyists have grumbled that the living wills are another costly exercise that requires companies to spend months trying, often unsuccessfully, to divine the will of regulators. In its statement, Wells Fargo said it had created an office within the bank dedicated to correcting problems with its living-will proposal.Democrats are holding up the living wills as an example of the strength and success of Dodd-Frank at a time when Republicans are vowing to undo parts of the law once President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who is the ranking member of the banking committee, said, \u201cToday\u2019s joint determination is a reminder that Wall Street reform is working to rein in the megabanks that crashed our economy and got bailed out by taxpayers.\u201dIt is ironic, in some ways, that Wells is the one bank that continues to have problems proving to regulators that it could manage its unwinding itself in the event of a bankruptcy.During the financial crisis, Wells avoided many of the mortgage missteps that nearly sank Wall Street. Compared with other large banks, it was relatively well capitalized to withstand the shocks of the 2008 crisis.But its regulatory star has fallen since the sham account scandal erupted. The bank\u2019s longtime leader, John G. Stumpf, was called to testify twice before Congress, where he faced a barrage of criticism for failing to properly manage the bank and stamp out the bad behavior. Mr. Stumpf has since stepped down. In a settlement over the illegal accounts, Wells paid $185 million \u2014 including $100 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest fine that agency had ever assessed.The regulators cited specific technical deficiencies in Wells\u2019s living will, including issues of \u201cshared services\u201d and \u201clegal entity rationalization.\u201d These problems generally point to the fact, regulators have said, that Wells has not figured out how to adequately unwind all of the many complex and interconnected parts of its banking empire.Regulators said the other four other banks they had faulted in April \u2014 Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 had addressed the deficiencies in their plans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kansas, Where Republicans and Fiscal Woes Reign, Democrats Made Inroads", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byOVERLAND PARK, Kan. \u2014 Brett Parker, an elementary school teacher and rookie politician, was a Democrat running against a Republican incumbent in a Republican state that the Republican presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, clinched by 20 percentage points.In spite of all that, Mr. Parker will be sworn into the Kansas House of Representatives next month, one of 13 legislative seats the Democrats picked up here.In this election year, voters across Kansas leaned firmly to the right at the federal level, but showed far more nuance when it came to their state. In parts of Kansas, they punished conservative legislators linked to Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s tax-cutting doctrine, instead gravitating toward moderate Republicans and Democrats like Mr. Parker who blame the governor and his legislative allies for imperiling the state\u2019s finances and putting public schools at risk.\u201cTheir goal was very simple, and that was to associate me with Brownback,\u201d said James Todd, the two-term Republican lawmaker Mr. Parker challenged here in suburban Kansas City. \u201cThat obviously was effective enough to beat me.\u201dFor generations, Republicans have dominated Kansas politics, and that seems unlikely to change any time soon. Many voters here believe strongly in the party\u2019s message on issues such as abortion and gun rights and want limits on government spending. But some of those same Republicans have grown frustrated during Governor Brownback\u2019s six-year tenure with perpetual budget shortfalls, cuts to road projects, rollbacks to social services and, especially resonant here in Overland Park, perceived budget threats to public schools.Here, conservatives attribute much of the strain to downturns in the agriculture and energy industries, both central elements in the Kansas economy. Others question whether the cuts and deficits are symptomatic of a political swing that went too far to the right.\u201cThe pendulum finally snapped,\u201d said Brian Brown, a Republican who lives in Mr. Todd\u2019s House district, but who spurned his own party and volunteered for Mr. Parker\u2019s campaign.Going door to door, Mr. Brown said, some voters he met voiced frustration with Mr. Brownback, but were still reluctant to cross party lines. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m glad you brought that up, because I\u2019m a registered Republican voter, and let me tell you why I\u2019m doing this right now, walking, holding a sign for a Democratic candidate,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brown said.Mr. Brownback, who took office after eight years of Democratic governors, has led a rightward policy shift. He signed legislation rolling back income taxes and eliminating some business taxes, all the while assuring voters that economic growth would help make up for lost revenue.The type of growth Mr. Brownback counted on has not materialized, though, and the state\u2019s revenue estimates have repeatedly been off by wide margins, forcing years of cuts to state agencies and reductions in government services. Mr. Brownback, who has promised to announce next month a way to deal with the latest deficit, has defended the tax cuts and criticized past government spending levels as too high.Some here have speculated that the governor might take a job in the Trump administration. A spokeswoman said Mr. Brownback was unavailable for comment.\u201cThere are certainly places where we can still find cuts and efficiencies,\u201d said Shawn Sullivan, the state budget director, who said additional taxes and \u201cone-time fixes\u201d were also options. \u201cEverything\u2019s on the table at this point.\u201dDistaste for the governor, combined with a decreased emphasis on social issues like abortion, created an opening for candidates like Mr. Parker, who campaigned largely on the budget and the threat he said conservative policy-making posed to public schools.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to wrap your head around the hole we\u2019re in,\u201d Mr. Parker said.In Olathe, the nearby suburb where he teaches, Mr. Parker said staff layoffs, reduced janitorial service and the elimination of Spanish classes for elementary students had already taken a toll.Education and fears about more budget strain helped lift Mr. Parker and other candidates in suburban districts, where grass-roots parent groups emerged as a new political force.\u201cPeople are so fed up, so tired, frustrated, of what is happening to our great state,\u201d said Jennifer Jarrell, a former Republican precinct committeewoman who became involved with Stand Up Blue Valley.In Hutchinson, home to about 40,000 people near the state\u2019s middle, Patsy Terrell said a road project had been put off because of the budget woes, frustrating voters. \u201cThat means jobs, and not just jobs, but good-paying jobs, as well as updating our infrastructure,\u201d said Ms. Terrell, a Democrat who won a first term in the Legislature, beating a 25-year incumbent.In a House district in Newton, a railroad town north of Wichita, Tim Hodge campaigned against the Brownback tax policy and unseated another Republican incumbent. \u201cWe got people who our message worked with,\u201d Mr. Hodge said. \u201cThose are usually people who are just struggling with life, making an hourly wage, living in a rental house. They don\u2019t even follow politics very well.\u201dWhile Democrats picked up 13 seats in the Legislature, and several moderate Republicans beat conservatives in primaries, the practical effect of the state\u2019s shift remains uncertain. Republicans held onto large majorities in both chambers of the Legislature, and conservatives kept the most influential leadership positions. Moderate Republicans and Democrats might pass some bills by voting as a bloc, though they may not be able to overcome a veto.Clayton Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, acknowledged a widespread unease over the state\u2019s finances, and said he believed that many of the first-time lawmakers \u201care going to have a very sharp learning curve on the fiscal issues facing the state.\u201dComplicating matters, the Kansas Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a lawsuit challenging the adequacy of state funding for public schools. The Supreme Court justices, many of whom conservatives tried unsuccessfully to oust in last month\u2019s election, could order hundreds of millions of dollars in additional education spending.\u201cThe election happened, we moved to the center, and now the rubber meets the road,\u201d said Patrick Miller, a University of Kansas political scientist. \u201cWhere do you find the money? What do you do about Brownback\u2019s veto? And what do you do about the Supreme Court ruling?\u201dAdvertisement"}

That can be properly addressed in comprehensive tax reform,\u201d the speaker told a Wisconsin reporter.In a storm of Twitter posts over the weekend, the president-elect had been uncompromising on the proposal.An umbrella organization of Jewish groups is holding a Hanukkah party at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, and one of its member groups is not too happy about it.\u201cIn the years to come, Jews in America are going to be regularly tested to make the right choices, and this is clearly not one of them,\u201d wrote Peter Pepper and Ann Toback, the president and executive director of the Workmen\u2019s Circle, in a letter to Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoenlein said that the venue choice had been made by the partner for the party, the Azerbaijani Embassy, and that it was one of the few places that would hold a kosher reception on short notice.\u201cThere\u2019s no other significance to it,\u201d Mr. Hoenlein said, adding that Mr. Trump is not yet president, \u201cso there\u2019s no conflict.\u201dMr. Trump has a message to the news media: Cover him the way he wants or he\u2019ll just have to keep tweeting \u2014 regardless of the consequences.The next dates are out:\u25a0 Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N.C., at 7 p.m. Tuesday\u25a0 Hy-Vee Hall in Des Moines at 7 p.m. Central time Thursday.\u25a0 DeltaPlex Arena in Grand Rapids, Mich., at 7 p.m. FridayRetired Marine Corps Gen.

The reality is that if you only have a high school level education or worse, don\u2019t even graduate from high school, then you will be unemployable.Max, New York It is time we discarded the fiction that just getting a college degree is going to make a difference. First of all, it is at least four years spent learning humanities or science, which will only be of benefit to a few. Second, it is creating a lot of debt, which then cramps the standard of living of the college graduate for many future years. What is needed is a return to the free public vocational high schools and trade schools of the past, where men and women can learn skills necessary in today\u2019s society, and which can be rapidly turned into income-producing work. Training in technology, computers, medical devices, plumbing, car repair, etc.Others thought the minimum wage was the problem, but disagreed on whether it should be raised or eliminated: Steve B., Belgrade, Maine A decent minimum wage would cushion the blow of going from an industrial job to a service job. Forty-five percent of all American workers are paid less than $15 per hour. Simply raising their salaries will improve their standard of living. No gimmicks, government programs, etc.Andrew Myers, Cambridge, Mass.Jobs have disappeared because the minimum wage is too high. If workers cannot deliver value commensurate with their wage, there will be no job; the robots will take it. Better to get rid of minimum wage entirely so everyone has a job and the self-respect and self-development that come along with it.Many readers thought the nature of work should change, like shortening the workweek or improving fast-growing service-sector jobs: Childofsol, Alaska The standard workweek was set at 40 hours in 1940. With machines doing so much of our work, it is probably time to start decreasing the standard workweek.Michael Merrill, Princeton, N.J.The solution lies in raising the standards of service-sector workers, enabling those who care for human needs to make a decent living doing so. This will not happen by fiat or regulation. Service-sector standards will only be raised by structural changes in the labor market.Others thought the government needed to step in, like providing a universal basic income or a stronger safety net: Michael Tyndall, SF We should ensure we have more robust safety nets in urban and rural communities, and we should also test the practicalities and economics of a basic living stipend for all citizens. Increasing populations of unemployed and homeless citizens is a recipe for increasing crime, substance abuse and ultimately civil unrest. It\u2019s a lot to do, but fortunately we\u2019re not broke.C, GreensboroWe can\u2019t be a country that requires every man to pull himself up by his bootstraps and then snatch his boots away.Some readers suggested less population growth: JMWB, MontanaThe only way that job losses due to automation would be a good thing is if the population expansion rate dropped to zero or less. We have way more people than good jobs for those people.And at least a few readers warned that the problem was only just beginning: Martin Green, San DiegoAutomation is in its infancy. This coming from a man who has been creating factory automation since 1989. We are just getting started. Any activity that requires only a physical presence will be automated. Store checkers? Uber drivers? Laborers of all sorts, you are warned. Your job will disappear within your lifetime. Start now, right now, to develop new skills. What can a human do that a computer cannot do? Higher-level reasoning. Even those jobs will be eliminated in 30 years as systems become cognitive. What will develop is a society similar to the antebellum South, with systems replacing human slaves. The owners will live well. Everyone else will struggle. Which future is yours?Advertisement"}

As of Friday morning, the high bid was $72,888.But then the auction disappeared from the Charitybuzz website that had been hosting it, along with details on all the bids that had been offered since it opened on Dec. 5.\u201cThe loser is St. Jude, and the winner I\u2019m not exactly sure,\u201d one of the bidders, the Tex-Mex restaurateur Russell Ybarra, wrote in an email, referring to the Tennessee children\u2019s hospital, which stood to reap the proceeds.The Obama family has not directly participated in any fund-raising solicitation efforts since President Obama took office to avoid the impression that donations would allow the donor to get special access, said Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer.The president-elect\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, told New York business leaders on Friday that Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for a large-scale federal infrastructure program was \u201ccloser\u201d to Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s, the incoming minority leader, than to the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s.Mr. Kushner made the remarks at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City, just after an appearance by Mr. Schumer, the New York senator.This week at a news conference in Washington, Mr. McConnell said he was not interested in \u201ctrillion-dollar stimulus\u201d to finance any infrastructure plan, setting up what could be the first of many clashes with a Trump White House that will not always hew to Republican orthodoxy.This does not excite Mr. McConnell who, like most Republicans, recalls President Obama\u2019s early stimulus plan unfavorably. That plan came in the middle of the worst recession since the Depression.\u201cWe need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly,\u201d Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky senator, said this week.Senate watchers used to the obstructionist stance that the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, took with President Obama for eight years have been waiting for signs of the kind of minority leader that Mr. Schumer will be when he takes over as Democratic leader.The Democratic senator sent a big flashing of conciliation on Friday.Mr. Schumer praised Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the president of Taiwan, which drew objections from both sides of the aisle, as a shrewd move that sent a signal to China of a change in direction.Mr. Schumer made the remarks at the same annual meeting of the Partnership for New York City that Mr. Kushner spoke at, according to two people in attendance.Those attendees interpreted the comments as aligning Mr. Schumer with Mr. Trump on a diplomatic issue that has been met with consternation by the Obama White House.Mr. Schumer described the call that Mr. Trump took roughly two weeks ago as shrewd, and not necessarily indicating that it was a reflection of his view of the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, the two attendees said.An aide to Mr. Schumer did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Mr. Schumer has been a critic of China as a currency manipulator over the years. At the breakfast, where he was followed by Mr. Kushner, Mr. Schumer suggested that Democrats lost in part because the election was about a change in course, and Hillary Clinton ran as a continuation of the Obama administration\u2019s direction.The president-elect took to Twitter on Friday to again dismiss the significance of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election \u2014 but with a new twist. This time, he seemed to praise the revelations of one of the cyberattacks.Ms. Brazile\u2019s subject line: \u201cOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\u201d\u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,\u201d Ms. Brazile wrote to John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and Jennifer Palmieri, the candidate\u2019s communications director.That might seem like a pretty obvious question, given that the debate was in Flint to address the crisis over the city\u2019s lead-contaminated water. But it cost Ms. Brazile her commentator\u2019s job at CNN, and it helped to fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation during the campaign that the election was \u201crigged\u201d in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor.With the inauguration about a month away, a solid majority \u2014 62 percent \u2014 say the president-elect will bring real change to the way Washington works.

The answer, actually, is no. They are far worse than kapos \u2014 Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.J Street reacted almost immediately to news of Mr. Friedman\u2019s nomination, calling on the Senate to reject him.\u201cAs someone who has been a leading American friend of the settlement movement, who lacks any diplomatic or policy credentials and who has attacked liberal Jews who support two states as \u2018worse than kapos\u2019, Friedman should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel,\u201d the group said in a statement.The Republican Jewish Coalition was all praise:\u201cThe selection of Mr. David Friedman to serve as United States ambassador to Israel sends a powerful signal to the Jewish community and the State of Israel that President-elect Trump\u2019s administration will strengthen the bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region.\u201cWe look forward to working with David and the entire Trump administration to cripple Iran\u2019s ability to develop nuclear weapons through new and strengthened sanctions, move the U.S. Embassy to the eternal capital of Israel, Jerusalem, and repair relations with our greatest ally in the Middle East that have eroded over the last eight years.\u201dA Trump economic adviser, Stephen Moore, caused quite a kerfuffle in Detroit on Thursday when in a fit of excitement, he announced that the economic commentator Larry Kudlow would be named chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers.Mr. Kudlow, while certainly versed in economics, is not an economist. He has an undergraduate degree in history. The council chairman has traditionally been pulled from the highest echelons of academia to advise the president, not to lobby or persuade.Moreover, Mr. Kudlow is an ardent free trader and was openly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s position on trade during the campaign, even as he enthusiastically backed the candidate.After the Democrats sent out their reactions, and the news media came alive, Mr. Moore sheepishly admitted that, while he is pulling for his friend Mr. Kudlow, the deal is not done.\u201cLarry is the obvious choice, because he has all the connections with the key players on Capitol Hill, and there\u2019s nobody that can articulate the free-market, conservative economic message better than Larry can,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Which Trump Will the World See?", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOne of the basic themes of Donald J. Trump\u2019s election campaign was that the United States was being ripped off by foreign countries and that his administration would reduce our trade deficit.Yet the budget policies he is now proposing would be sharply at odds with that goal. By advocating an expansive budget through tax cuts and infrastructure spending, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would most likely lower national savings and propel the United States dollar ever higher, creating the very conditions to widen rather than to narrow the trade deficit.Mr. Trump seems to be overlooking a matter of basic arithmetic. While a country\u2019s trade balance is the difference between a country\u2019s exports and imports, it is also the difference between the amount it saves and invests, as can be derived from rearranging the components of a country\u2019s aggregate demand equation. If a country saves more than it invests, it will run a trade surplus. Conversely, a country that saves less than it invests will run a trade deficit.Seemingly oblivious to this basic math, Mr. Trump is proposing far-reaching and seemingly unfunded cuts in both corporate and household tax rates. Worse yet, he is simultaneously proposing large increases in both public infrastructure and military spending.He is doing so in the unrealistic hope that these policies will cause the economy to accelerate from its present 2 percent growth rate to between 3 and 4 percent. And he is counting on such faster economic growth to generate additional tax revenue.Should a significant pickup in economic growth not materialize, the net effect of these tax cuts and public spending policies will almost certainly lead to a significant widening of the budget deficit and to a corresponding decline in public savings. That, in turn, would in all probability lead to a significant widening of the trade deficit as the country\u2019s overall savings rate would decline.A further basic weakness of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal is that it would add stimulus to the economy at the very time that the economy is at or very close to full employment. That policy is bound to raise concerns about inflation and to push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than it is currently contemplating in order to meet its inflation target.One of the distinguishing characteristics of the global economy right now is the divergence of monetary policy stances among the world\u2019s major central banks. The United States Federal Reserve is now embarked on a path of raising interest rates at a time when the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are still engaged in aggressive rounds of quantitative easing in an effort to kick-start their moribund economies.Forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace than it is presently contemplating will only serve to widen the difference between it and the other major central banks. This would more than likely put further upward pressure on the dollar.Since the November election, the United States dollar has already appreciated significantly, to its strongest level in the past 14 years. The last thing that the country needs if it is to reduce its trade deficit is a further dollar appreciation. Such an appreciation would make our exports across the board more expensive in foreign markets and make our imports cheaper in United States dollar terms. That would hardly seem to be the way to reduce the country\u2019s trade deficit.A real concern is that, as the United States external deficit widens because of a reckless budget policy approach, Mr. Trump will double down on his interventionist and protectionist approach to trade matters. As we saw in his recent intervention with the Carrier Corporation, this seems to be his preferred way of dealing with trade issues.If he does go down that path, he will risk inviting trade retaliation by our trade partners, which could lead the global economy down the road to the beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the 1930s. As surely even Mr. Trump must know, trade wars are no solution.Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was formerly a deputy director in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Races to Clinch Oil Deals Before Donald Trump Takes Office", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is racing to sign as many oil deals with Western companies as he can before hard-liners at home and President-elect Donald J. Trump have a chance to return the Mideast country to cultural and economic isolation.At the same time, Iran is in a battle with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to reclaim its position as one of the world\u2019s leading oil exporters, a spot it lost during the years of international sanctions over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.Iran\u2019s oil industry, the lifeblood of its economy, was devastated by the cumulative impact of the nuclear sanctions, which halved petroleum exports and left the country ostracized economically.The deals, if completed, would bring much-needed expertise and foreign investment. Just as important, though, the agreements could provide a lifeline to the rest of the world, experts say, cementing relations with a number of European and Asian countries. That, they say, could provide an insurance policy of sorts against any punitive actions taken next year by the Trump administration and the Republican-dominated Congress.\u201cOur officials are in a rush to sign contracts with big oil companies in order to have leverage when Trump enters the White House,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist with close ties to the government of Mr. Rouhani. The Iranian president came to power promising to end Iran\u2019s isolation and revive its economy, so the advent of a Trump presidency poses a dire threat to his political future.Analysts noted that the deals were only memorandums of understanding, not hard contracts. But they stressed that the agreements also indicated a strong desire by Western and Asian energy companies to send a message to Washington as they return to Iran, once the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of oil.\u201cIt seems the big oil and gas companies in Europe are determined to show Mr. Trump that they are going to make deals with Iran anyway,\u201d said Reza Zandi, an Iranian journalist and analyst who specializes in the oil and gas industries. \u201cThese are important signals to America,\u201d he added.Mr. Zandi said it was not hard to see why the oil companies were so eager to return to Iran. \u201cWe need $40 billion in investment in the oil and gas sector each year,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t have such resources inside the country.\u201dBut Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, told the semiofficial news agency Fars in November that only foreign companies had the ability and capital to modernize Iran\u2019s crumbling oil and gas sector. \u201cWe need technology, including the management technology that allows a project to come into operation in four years rather than in 12 years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd above all, we need the money.\u201dIran also faces a struggle to rebuild its oil exports. Growing production has allowed Iran in recent months to recover many of the Asian and European markets that it lost to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers during the years when sanctions were in effect. And as Iran effectively flexes its muscles in OPEC for the first time since the sanctions were lifted in January, its goal is not only to protect its newfound gains but also to expand its markets, pitting it directly against its bitter sectarian rival, Saudi Arabia.Further production and export expansion, however, will require more foreign investment.The new wave of agreements with Iran, most of which remain provisional, began on Nov. 8, the day of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, when Total, a French company, became the first Western energy company to negotiate a deal to develop and produce natural gas from a section of a giant Persian Gulf gas field. Total leads a consortium that includes the China National Petroleum Corporation and Petropars, a subsidiary of the Iranian state-run oil company, in the $4.8 billion project. The provisional agreement is expected to be completed early next year.\u201cThey are signing before Trump does something,\u201d said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Texas-based oil services company that works in North Africa and the Middle East. \u201cThe Iranians will give the Europeans favorable terms because of Trump. They want to send a message to Trump that if you try to cancel this agreement, we will just go to the Europeans.\u201dIran needs foreign capital and technical expertise to reach its immediate goal of returning to its 2011 oil production level of 4.3 million barrels a day, reversing a drop that began even before sanctions were imposed. Many Iranian fields are old and in decline, requiring sophisticated and expensive redrilling of wells and injections of water and carbon dioxide to coax more oil from the ground.Since oil export sanctions were lifted, Iran\u2019s production has risen almost a third, to about 3.7 million barrels a day, with minimal foreign help. By reaching agreements with Total and Shell, Tehran now has the ambitious goal of reaching production levels of 4.8 million barrels a day by 2021, which would give it added clout in OPEC and the ability to go head-to-head with Saudi Arabia in competing for growing Asian markets, particularly in India.Iran wants to ramp up production at the very moment that Saudi Arabia wants to cut output to lift prices. Using its recovered production leverage, Iran agreed to go along with the decision to collectively cut 1.2 million barrels a day of production only when the other members conceded to its demands that it be allowed to increase production by about 90,000 barrels a day next year.It remains to be seen whether the agreement to scale back production, not slated to take effect until January, will hold up. Similar agreements among OPEC members in the past have crumbled in the face of widespread cheating and a lack of an enforcement mechanism. The agreement is also contingent on cooperation from a handful of non-OPEC producers, particularly Russia, which is notoriously unreliable in such matters, said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist who served in the Ford and Carter administrations.\u201cThere is no one who will concede market share, and so there is no way to come to an enforceable agreement,\u201d Mr. Verleger said.But just the fact that Iran was able to play a leading role at the OPEC meeting is a sign that its leaders are determined to return to world markets \u2014 as long as they are not stymied once again by geopolitical developments.Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Tossed On the First Tinsel? Two Baltic Capitals Disagree", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBaltics JournalRIGA, Latvia \u2014 In the Baltics, there may be no war on Christmas but there\u2019s a pretty prickly one over the tree.More than civic pride is at stake. Christmas-themed travel has become extremely lucrative, especially in the ice-choked north, where there are no swaying palms to lure the winter-weary.And this year, the rivalry has taken on both an added urgency and a darker tinge.The Christmas tree spat began in 2010, when Latvians started an advertising campaign that claimed that Riga was the first, citing 1510 as the year when a mysterious and rambunctious medieval brotherhood known as the House of the Black Heads paraded through Riga carrying a constructed replica of a tree. They decorated it with fruits and candles, danced around it and then, a few days later, burned it to the ground.Hold on a second, responded the Estonians. They produced evidence that they claim showed that a similar festival had taken place at yet another lodge of the Black Heads, this one in Tallinn in 1441.And their festival, Estonians claim, involved a real tree. In fact, said the historian Juri Kuuskemaa, \u201cwe can be sure it was a spruce.\u201dRiga\u2019s mayor, Nils Usakovs, countered that claim by saying that the Estonians employ post-truth tactics when it comes to the invention of the Christmas tree.It\u2019s an unusual war, fought with ornaments and historians.\u201cCities like Berlin had to wait until the 18th century before the first recorded public use of a Christmas tree,\u201d sniffed Mr. Kuuskemaa, 74, who is also the official Herald of Tallinn, a ceremonial position for which he often dons period garb. \u201cAnd for Paris and London, it didn\u2019t happen until the 19th century. Tallinn and Riga did it centuries before all the great metropolises of Europe.\u201dHe said the Christmas tree conflict, in reality, had reached a bit of a historical stalemate, as there was not enough contextual evidence to say for certain which city came first. But he doesn\u2019t care.\u201cAny time they say they were first, they have to mention also our city,\u201d he said. \u201cTourists from Germany or Belgium or Russia don\u2019t care for historical truth; they care about cities with fancy Christmas trees, fancy Christmas markets. And when they read that there is also this battle between Tallinn and Riga \u2014 it\u2019s fun!\u201dNearly 200 miles north, in Tallinn, the chairman of the Estonian Parliament\u2019s defense committee, Hannes Hanso, stood beside the official parliamentary tree and declared that he took a policy of total nonrecognition when it came to Riga\u2019s claims.\u201cI didn\u2019t know Latvia had any claim to the first Christmas tree,\u201d he said with mock incredulity.With the weak ruble keeping many Russian tourists at home, Christmas profits are even more under threat. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the birth of Jesus in early January, so the holiday markets could stay open for weeks longer and still find eager crowds.Mariann Lugus, secretary general of the Estonian Travel and Tourism Association, said that Estonia had detected a dip in the number of Russian tourists in January 2014. A year later, though, after the Russian seizure of Crimea and the imposition of international sanctions, Russian tourism plummeted. Only about half as many Russians visited that January.Latvia, for some reason, has not experienced similar drops. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that is,\u201d said Irena Riekstina, secretary general of the Association of Latvian Travel Agents and Tour Operators. \u201cThis is probably going to happen at some point and we need to prepare for this.\u201dKeen to compete is Remigijus Simasius, the mayor of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Though his city has no claim to the first Christmas tree, he hopes to compete with even larger and more elaborate presentations.He threw down the gauntlet this year with a towering tree adorned with 50,000 bulbs, which drew wide acclaim. His tree provoked rebukes from Russia, though, where several articles accused the Lithuanians of copying the tree\u2019s design from a smaller one in Moscow\u2019s Red Square.Lithuania may have no claim to the first Christmas tree, Mr. Simasius said in his annual Christmas speech, but it was important to think in broader terms.\u201cWe are part of the Baltic Sea region, and we are happy that this tradition is born in our region,\u201d he said.Mr. Lejeune said that \u201cin troubled times, people like to have landmarks,\u201d and that\u2019s what European holiday markets have become.\u201cPeople also like to escape when the news makes them afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why magic movies have such success in cinemas. The Christmas markets also allow people to escape a bit from reality.\u201dBut not everyone is in the Christmas spirit. Gustavs Strenga, an archivist and historian at the National Library of Latvia, said that both Riga and Tallinn were guilty of making creative leaps with their historical interpretations.Actually, he said, those tree-themed celebrations by the Black Heads had nothing to do with Christmas and were connected to other festivities the brotherhood celebrated.Looking down at his coffee cup, Mr. Strenga admitted that his skeptical position had not gone down well in Latvia.\u201cI\u2019ve been called the Grinch,\u201d he said.Richard Martyn-Hemphill reported from Riga, Latvia, and Joanna Berendt from Warsaw.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Progress Eludes Him on Social Issues, De Blasio Finds Success Elsewhere", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byInside a jewel-box building dedicated to biomedical research on the East River, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday described his plan for expanding the city\u2019s biotech industry. About an hour later, he took broader questions, including several on the latest in a string of high-level departures from health and human services departments.The two threads drew together what is perhaps a paradoxical reality facing Mr. de Blasio as he turns the corner into next year\u2019s re-election campaign. As his administration struggles on some of the issues the mayor cares most deeply about, like homelessness and child welfare, he has found success on others \u2014 job creation, economic development \u2014 that can appear at times to be rhetorical afterthoughts.By the end of the day on Tuesday, the struggles won out. A state agency released a scathing report highlighting failures at the city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services and calling for the hiring of an outside monitor. The release forced the city to unveil its own findings of the agency\u2019s failings that preceded the death of a 6-year-old Harlem boy, Zymere Perkins.A similar concentration of high-level turnover has not been seen in other areas of city government. It is happening against a backdrop of negative headlines over child fatalities in city shelters and the city\u2019s growing homeless population, which Mr. de Blasio has said his administration is doing everything it can to control.The mayor cautioned against reading too much into the departures, but alluded to his hands-on management style on the issues they oversaw. \u201cI think the fact is it\u2019s really tough subject matter; I push people really hard,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cWe all want to go farther. I think that\u2019s the frustration. We all want to go farther.\u201dAs the administration fights to reduce a surge in homelessness and reform its children\u2019s services approach, the mayor has increasingly seized on success stories from the business community, like record job growth and tourism.Indeed, the reason for gathering reporters on Tuesday was not to discuss children\u2019s services, but to unveil a multiyear plan aimed at spurring economic growth and thousands of new jobs in the biotech field.\u201cYou always want to try to change the subject if you can,\u201d said Evan Thies, a Democratic political consultant. \u201cHe is now attempting to pivot a bit and show that a progressive economic agenda is also the solution. That will be a nifty trick if he can pull it off. And it\u2019s certainly something that the party is talking about nationally as well as locally.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re working from a good playbook,\u201d he said. \u201cWe intend to do the same thing for life sciences.\u201dThe plan would include city investment in biotech, including $50 million for existing research facilities at the city\u2019s academic medical centers and research institutions, $10 million for a network of start-ups and millions more to support new business in the field. That is in addition to tax incentives totaling $300 million over 25 years to expand the amount of lab space.A cornerstone of the city\u2019s effort is, for the moment, more speculative: a $100 million for a campus either on the East Side of Manhattan or across the river in Long Island City, Queens. That project will take years to complete, even after a site is chosen, a process that will not begin until next year.\u201cI think it\u2019s a big and bold idea,\u201d said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents that area of Queens. \u201cObviously we need to know more about the where and the how.\u201dThe city estimated that 9,000 academic and private sector biotech jobs would be created over a decade as a result of the investments \u2014 the city currently has about 24,000 such jobs \u2014 and thousands more from companies in related fields.\u201cThere\u2019s enormous momentum in the city\u2019s private-sector economy,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit business group that is supportive of the mayor\u2019s biotech plan. \u201cAnd while the mayor\u2019s political agenda has been focused on social issues, he certainly recognizes, as he did today, that jobs and skills training are the path to upward mobility.\u201dA day earlier, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo unveiled his own $650 million effort to invest in biotech across state, a coincidence of timing that underscored the importance of the sector for New York as well as the continuing rivalry between the two leaders. Mr. de Blasio described the plans as \u201ccomplementary.\u201dThat the two leaders could not be brought together for a joint announcement \u2014 despite efforts among some supporters of biotech investment to do so \u2014 revived the sense that they are incapable of working together even on areas of agreement.Further confirmation of that sense followed when the mayor failed to acknowledge, in discussing the independent monitor for the children\u2019s services agency with reporters, that it had been ordered by the state to hire the monitor. The state\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services then released its report in which it called for the monitor, prompting the city to release its own report.The findings were largely the same: A child died and those city workers tasked with protecting him had not done everything they could have to prevent the death.Advertisement"}

A who\u2019s-who of the wealthiest chief executives from some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies, among them: Mary T. Barra of General Motors, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Company, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM.The purpose, according to a statement released by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team: \u201cTo provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, nonbureaucratic and nonpartisan manner.\u201d\u201cTrump is doubling down on crony capitalists who don\u2019t understand that a healthy economy requires a healthy planet and consumers with money in their pockets,\u201d said its co-founder, David Brodwin.Officials for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition did not confirm the call or include it in a rundown they gave on Friday of conversations with world leaders that Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence had held over the past 24 hours.They did provide official accounts on Thursday of calls Mr. Trump had with the prime minister of Pakistan and the president of Kazakhstan, but those were sanitized versions of the readouts provided by those countries, which indicated that the president-elect had heaped praise on their leaders and suggested a readiness to side with them on delicate matters of diplomacy.\u201cJob 1 is getting people put back to work \u2014 we\u2019re talking about Obamacare, the Keystone Pipeline, the Waters in the U.S. and the Clean Power Plan,\u201d he said, singling out the transcontinental pipeline that President Obama killed, new clean water regulations and Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change plan.Asked about killing the Iran nuclear deal between the Islamic Republic and the western powers, he did not hide his feelings.\u201cIt\u2019s not a treaty, it\u2019s a presidential resolution and it can be reversed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very dangerous deal. It provides a pathway for Iran to become a nuclear power and you just cannot allow that.\u201dSupporters of the deal, including Mr. Obama and the governments of Britain, Japan, France, Germany and Russia say it will prevent Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, not facilitate it.Much has been said about the photo of a windblown president-elect and his tie, exposed as taped together. Well, a tall man \u2014 Brendan Buck, senior aide to House Speaker Paul D.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Ride-Hailing Rules Focus on Where Drivers Call Home", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Fresh from school with a degree in hotel management, Luo Haichao left his hometown and moved to Beijing to look for a bigger paycheck. He eventually found one in a different sector: driving cars. China has created its own local versions of Uber and Lyft, and the ride-hailing business is booming.But now Mr. Luo \u2014 and potentially tens of thousands of other drivers \u2014 will have to get off the road.Citing safety and other issues, the cities of Beijing and Shanghai said on Wednesday that Chinese ride-hailing companies must stop using out-of-town drivers like Mr. Luo and hire only local residents to sit behind the wheel.In a statement, Didi said the rules represented a \u201csignificant step toward a more sensible and liberal framework,\u201d and were less limiting on pricing, cars and driver restrictions than earlier drafts. A spokeswoman declined to comment on how the Beijing and Shanghai residency requirements for drivers would affect its business.But the new ride-share regulations show that the technology industry in China is coming up against long-held concerns in the country about overcrowding, a widening wealth gap and access to education, health care and other services.\u201cAt the bottom of the conflict is tension between powerful vested interests and a new rising class,\u201d said Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. The political power of China\u2019s taxi services \u2014 which see ride-hailing companies as dangerous rivals \u2014 presents a particularly strong challenge, he said.It is not clear how many drivers would be affected, but the numbers could be significant. In Shanghai, for instance, fewer than 10,000 of the 410,000 active drivers registered to Didi Chuxing have permanent residency papers, according to Didi. Also on Wednesday, the southern boomtown of Guangzhou joined cities that had previously instituted less-restrictive residency requirements. In its statement, Didi said the city of Beijing had given it five months to implement the rules.Officials in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment. But they were quoted by local news outlets citing safety concerns and a need to track drivers, as in the case a year ago, when a 28-year-old Beijing ride-share driver made headlines when he punched a drunk passenger, breaking an eye socket. The officials were also mentioned as citing local regulations already in place that require taxi drivers to be residents of the city where they work.At issue is China\u2019s unique household registration \u2014 or hukou \u2014 system, which was intended to keep rural workers from flooding into more populous regions. The larger cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, need a steady influx of people like Mr. Luo to function.The ride-hailing business poses especially tricky concerns for local governments. Taxi drivers, who are required to be local residents, feel threatened and have flexed their political muscle. In some cities, taxi drivers have gone on strike, sometimes harassing ride-share drivers.That has discouraged some ride-share drivers. \u201cThere are fewer and fewer rewards,\u201d said Wen Zhenjiang, 37, who worked for Didi and Uber in Beijing for nearly two years and is now looking for work driving trucks.There are other reasons to leave. Driving full-time often means 14- to 15-hour shifts each day, sometimes overnight if there is strong demand. Most drivers rent vehicles, but some \u2014 like Mr. Luo \u2014 bought their own after they started to make good money. To save on rent, many share apartments in the suburbs.Their employers don\u2019t keep tabs on how often the drivers work or require them to reach driving quotas. However, if they get bad ratings from passengers, they risk losing bonus payments.Still, the rewards of getting into the ride-hailing business are clear: Mr. Luo has occasionally earned about $4,350 in a month, or three times more than the average Beijing office worker.On Wednesday, online groups devoted to ride-share drivers were filled with messages of anger and disappointment. Many said they would return to driving illegal taxis. \u201dThat will probably make me more money,\u201d wrote a driver named Xiaowei. Another, named Canyue, said, \u201cWhatever the rule is, I will keep driving as long as I can still tap \u2018start a service\u2019 on my app.\u201dMr. Luo has a lot at stake. He is married and has an apartment and a mortgage back home in Chengde County in Hebei Province. His living is a good one for someone with a rural hukou. He is still making monthly payments equal to about $290 on his car and paying the same amount on his mortgage.\u201cThis is unfair to people from outside Beijing,\u201d he said.But his days in the business are probably numbered, he said on Wednesday. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t allowed, I will stop driving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I do? I can\u2019t put all my eggs in one basket.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs to Extend Its Reach in Trump Administration", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs\u2019s outsize influence in Washington is about to get larger.The position that Mr. Cohn is expected to take up is one that has long been identified with Goldman and its influence in the capital.The role was established by President Bill Clinton and given to Goldman\u2019s co-chairman at the time, Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Rubin\u2019s co-chairman, Stephen Friedman, later held the position under President George W. Bush.This time, however, the selection of a Goldman insider is at odds with statements made by Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. He repeatedly attacked the financial elite \u2014 and Goldman Sachs in particular.In a commercial that ran in the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Trump warned about \u201ca global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\u201d The face of Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein \u2014 Mr. Cohn\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator \u2014 was among the images that flashed ominously on the screen.And Mr. Trump criticized both Hillary Clinton and a primary opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, over their ties to the investment bank. \u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one primary debate. \u201cThey have total, total control\u201d over Mr. Cruz, he said. \u201cJust like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\u201dSince his election, however, Mr. Trump has stocked his future cabinet with a number of Goldman alumni, including Mr. Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and a former Goldman trader, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.Unlike those two, Mr. Cohn is a longtime top Goldman executive who was helping to guide the firm before and during the financial crisis.In Mr. Cohn, Mr. Trump is not only turning to yet another Goldman hand \u2014 and a registered Democrat \u2014 but he is also choosing a financier whose thinking about the economy has stood in contrast to the president-elect\u2019s more nationalistic views.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve it with domestic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump has criticized companies that have moved their work force overseas, Mr. Cohn has been candid about Goldman\u2019s international outlook: \u201cWe have a globalized work force, so when I need to go out and hire the incremental worker, I go out and look around the world and see where that incremental worker is available.\u201dMr. Cohn, though, has agreed with Mr. Trump about the need to lighten the regulations that have been imposed on banks like Goldman since the financial crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re all giving President-elect Trump and his transition team the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting to see what happens.\u201dMr. Cohn, 56, rose through the ranks of Goldman as a trader and is known for his gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, which could help explain his rapport with the plain-spoken Mr. Trump.In recent years, Mr. Cohn has been in line to take over the firm from Mr. Blankfein, and his departure will open the door to a new crop of candidates looking to lead the firm.While he has been registered as a Democrat, Mr. Cohn has donated to both political parties. He has given tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Yet more important, he has become friends with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser.The decision follows an extended courtship in which the Goldman executive visited with Mr. Trump three times, most recently on Thursday.Leaving Wall Street to take a top government post could provide a huge financial gain for Mr. Cohn.He would probably have to sell his Goldman holdings to avoid conflicts of interest with his new role, which would normally generate a big tax bill immediately. But tax regulations allow executive branch appointees to roll the proceeds of such a sale into Treasury securities and defer capital gains taxes.Mr. Cohn owned 872,712 shares in Goldman as of Nov. 14, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. As of Friday afternoon\u2019s stock price, that stake was worth about $209 million.Goldman Sachs has already been a beneficiary of the coming Trump administration. Mr. Trump has promised to push back on financial regulations passed since the financial crisis, which have come down particularly hard on Goldman. Since the election, shares of banks and other financial institutions have risen sharply; Goldman\u2019s is up 34 percent.On Friday, Goldman\u2019s shares edged up slightly.Mr. Cohn grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, the son of a real estate developer and electrical contractor. He later attended Gilmour Academy, a private school in the area, and then American University, though he has often spoken of his struggles with dyslexia.In 1994, Mr. Cohn joined the vaunted partnership at Goldman, in a class that included a number of financial luminaries: Eric M. Mindich, now a hedge fund mogul; J. Michael Evans, formerly a top Goldman executive in China who is now at the Alibaba Group; and Mr. Mnuchin himself.By 2006, Mr. Cohn had become co-president and co-chief operating officer of the firm when Mr. Blankfein took the helm as chief executive. He took sole ownership of the No. 2 spot in 2009 and solidified his role as the heir apparent.Over his career, the 6-foot-3 Mr. Cohn has been known for a brusque and intimidating presence, reportedly looming over traders at their desks. But he has softened that approach over the years as he became more of a financial diplomat, flying to Washington, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and other centers of power.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why More Mass Deportations Would Be Bad News for the Housing Market", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byTurned Out\u201cIt really started to make sense when you looked at the timing of things,\u201d said Mr. Rugh, a sociologist at Brigham Young University. \u201cWhen you looked at this peak of deportations, it came right on the eve of the housing crisis. So you could totally envision a scenario where people were losing male wage earners from households when home prices were collapsing.\u201dThese findings also reveal the spiraling and often unseen effects of mass deportations, a point that is no longer purely academic as President-elect Donald J. Trump weighs whether to make good on his campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.\u201cI always thought of this in terms of, we\u2019re looking back to see how these policies failed us in some big ways, or at least had some negative consequences to them,\u201d said Mr. Hall, a professor at Cornell University, describing his thinking as the two academics worked on the research. Now, he said, \u201cmy sense is that we\u2019re looking forward rather than looking backward.\u201dPrevious research suggests that Hispanic households, like black ones, were disproportionately victimized by subprime lending schemes that eventually pushed families into foreclosure. But the fact that foreclosure rates among Hispanics surpassed those among blacks points to something else going on.Mr. Rugh and Mr. Hall note that Cuban immigrants and Puerto Ricans \u2014 two groups not targeted for deportation because of their special immigration protections and citizenship status \u2014 didn\u2019t suffer the same high foreclosure rates.Mr. Hall and Mr. Rugh exploited the varied timing and geography of those 287(g) deals to compare what happened in the places that participated with those that didn\u2019t. Counties that signed on between 2005 and 2012 were home to about five million Central Americans and Mexicans, and about a quarter of the undocumented population in the country. (Counties that did not participate include places that consider themselves \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d)Before those counties joined the program, there was no difference in Hispanic foreclosure rates between places that eventually participated and those that didn\u2019t. But where counties signed on to the deportation effort, foreclosure rates in the following years were significantly higher \u2014 by the equivalent of about 22,000 additional Hispanic foreclosures each year across 42 counties.Such sizable effects are possible because of an often-overlooked dynamic in Hispanic households: Many undocumented immigrants live in \u2014 and contribute income to \u2014 households with legal residents. In those 42 counties, for example, the researchers estimate that nearly three-quarters of the 1.2 million households with at least one undocumented adult immigrant also contained a documented adult household member. And about a third of all undocumented immigrants in those counties lived in owner-occupied homes.\u201cIt\u2019s just so much higher than what people think,\u201d Mr. Rugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting twist on the Latino incorporation story: Their tremendous increases in homeownership and other things \u2014 a lot of those gains are because they pooled resources across legal status.\u201dAnd deportation, Mr. Rugh said, can have an effect similar to other life traumas that are known to increase foreclosure risk, like divorce, death of a family member and unemployment. \u201cIt\u2019s like unemployment,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody got unemployed because they got deported and removed from the country.\u201dBy deporting undocumented immigrants, in effect, the country may be making it harder for Hispanics to realize the American dream. And if that argument doesn\u2019t convince you, Mr. Rugh and Mr. Hall propose a more self-interested appeal for the country\u2019s coming debate over what to do about undocumented immigrants:Homeowners need Hispanic buyers.\u201cThis is the future,\u201d Mr. Rugh said. \u201cThe Asian and Latino population are a big part of the future of the housing market.

I found a space far away from the building on a darkened industrial street, and the long walk gave me time to prepare my condolences.The crowd cheered as they watched Fox News tick off state after state for Donald J. Trump. Then a prominent Texan seized the stage and the moment by suggesting that a victory for Mr. Trump was a sign of the Tex-ification of America.\u201cAs the country looks at the America they want to be, they look to Texas,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the Texas chairman of the Trump campaign, told the audience. \u201cWe are the America that everyone yearns for. That\u2019s why they move here, seven or eight hundred people a day. There\u2019s not another Texas to move to.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s America looks a lot like Texas. For years, Texas has been anticipating and provoking the red-state revolution that carried Mr. Trump to the White House. Since moving to Houston in 2011 to cover the state for The New York Times, I\u2019ve watched it become a kind of test market for Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.And long before Mr. Trump was promising to make America great again, former Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s 2010 book, \u201cFed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington,\u201d was using some of the same language to make the same points. The first chapter, \u201cAmerica Is Great, Washington Is Broken,\u201d is filled with so many references to America being great or not as great as it once was that it reads today like an outline of a Trump speech. \u201cBut perhaps most of all,\u201d Mr. Perry wrote, \u201cwe are fed up because deep down we know how great America has always been, how many great things the people have done in spite of their government, and how great the nation can be in the future if government will just get out of the way.\u201dBut Texas was not a model Trump state.And Mr. Trump\u2019s message, which resonated with white, working-class voters in Rust Belt states that have lost jobs, had less appeal in Texas, a majority-minority state with a robust economy and population. Mr. Trump won more votes in Texas than Mitt Romney did in 2012, but Mr. Romney had a more significant victory in Texas than Mr. Trump.

With the island\u2019s economy increasingly tied to the mainland\u2019s, and Beijing\u2019s global influence on the rise, he worried that Taiwan\u2019s independence was at stake \u2014 and might be a lost cause.Now, thanks to a couple of sentences uttered by Donald J. Trump on a talk show, Mr. Lin has new hope.What does it mean for one\u2019s homeland to be put on the table by Mr. Trump, an inveterate deal maker, in negotiations with China\u2019s Communist leaders, who are not known for making concessions easily?\u201cMany people in Taiwan worry that once Trump takes office, he\u2019ll make a U-turn,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cWe are suspicious of his motivations.\u201dThe gambit has both exhilarated and unnerved the people of Taiwan, who yearn for greater international recognition but have long been worried about being sacrificed as a pawn in a geopolitical chess game.Many have applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s stand, describing his decision to break protocol and speak by phone with Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s leader, as an overdue gesture toward one of Washington\u2019s most reliable friends in Asia and a young democracy. Taiwan is the United States\u2019 ninth-largest trading partner and has purchased more than $46 billion in American weapons since 1990.But residents are also coming to grips with the reality that their most vocal champion on the world stage now is a businessman known for his love of cutting deals and his erratic approach to policy making.\u201cHe\u2019s an uncontrollable force,\u201d said Hsu Tse-mei, 57, a retired bank manager in Taipei. \u201cWe\u2019re caught between two powerful countries, China and the United States, and we\u2019re at the mercy of Trump.\u201dThe stakes are high and help explain why Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors have generally left the One China policy untouched.Since the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communist Revolution, generations of Chinese leaders have vowed to reunify the island with the mainland and threatened war to prevent it from formally declaring independence. In the mid-1990s, China fired missiles into waters off Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate supporters of a formal separation.When the United States established relations with China in 1979, dropping its official recognition of the Nationalist, or Kuomintang, government in Taiwan, it secured a pledge from Beijing that its \u201cfundamental policy\u201d was to pursue reunification by peaceful means.Many in Taiwan are now afraid that China could reconsider that commitment if Mr. Trump scraps the One China policy.\u201cI\u2019m worried that China may take military action against Taiwan,\u201d said Li Meng-chieh, 33, a graphic designer in Taipei. \u201cIf that happens, it will derail our current way of life.\u201dSuch worries extend even to supporters of President Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has long favored greater independence from the mainland and has traditionally been willing to accept greater risks to pursue it.Ms. Tsai\u2019s administration has repeatedly assured China of its desire to maintain the status quo, and Lo Chih-cheng, a lawmaker from her party, said officials in Taiwan had avoided playing up the phone call with Mr. Trump so as not to antagonize Beijing.\u201cWe have tried to behave ourselves,\u201d Mr. Lo said. \u201cBut obviously China was not happy about it, so they chose Taiwan to blame. They used Taiwan as a scapegoat to divert their domestic discontent.\u201dJason Hu, a vice chairman of the opposition Nationalist Party, said initial excitement over the phone call had become regret. \u201cIt\u2019s a big power play that Taiwan should not be involved in,\u201d he said.Taiwanese society is deeply divided on the issue of closer relations with the mainland. Some see the island\u2019s prosperity as inextricably linked to China, while others are worried that Taiwan is already too dependent on the Chinese economy and thus vulnerable to pressure from Beijing. But few in Taiwan are interested in reunification under China\u2019s authoritarian political system.The Chinese leadership is worried Mr. Trump will make its goal of reunification even more difficult to achieve and embolden those in Taiwan who want to pursue greater international recognition and a more formal break with the mainland.The government in Beijing has ratcheted up its criticism of Mr. Trump in recent days, including with an editorial in a state-run newspaper that called him \u201cas ignorant as a child\u201d on foreign policy and suggested China might offer military assistance to American enemies in retaliation.But China is likely to lash out against Taiwan first. \u201cThe Chinese can punish Taiwan and get away with it,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, \u201cbut they can\u2019t do that to the Trump administration.\u201dWhen Mr. Nixon met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, he hoped to use the prospect of a break with Taiwan and normalization of relations with Beijing to drive a wedge between China and the Soviet Union and secure China\u2019s help in ending the Vietnam War. But President Xi Jinping of China has taken a hard line against independence for Taiwan and Hong Kong and may not have much room to maneuver given rising nationalist sentiment in the party and the broader public.Analysts said it would be politically difficult for Mr. Xi to offer concessions on trade or security issues in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on the One China policy, which Beijing has long portrayed as nonnegotiable and the prerequisite for cooperation on other issues.\u201cThis will put Xi Jinping under pressure at home,\u201d said Su Chi, chairman of the Taipei Forum, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official in the Nationalist Party, which favors closer ties with the mainland. \u201cHe will have to take action to show that he can\u2019t be played around and taken advantage of by the Taiwanese president.\u201dOther Republican presidents who have expressed support for Taiwan \u2014 Ronald Reagan pledged to continue arms sales indefinitely, and George W. Bush vowed to do \u201cwhatever it took\u201d to defend the island if attacked by China \u2014 generally did so in ideological terms, supporting its evolution into the world\u2019s only Chinese democracy.But Mr. Trump has not made such statements, and that has prompted many in Taiwan to question the health of the island\u2019s relationship with the United States.Some argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach should be a sign that Taiwan cannot rely on Washington and needs to strengthen ties with other countries in Asia.Others say that he has presented Taiwan with a chance to expand trade with the United States and build support among the American public.Mr. Lin, the student protest leader, said Mr. Trump had opened a potential path for Taiwan to gain the international recognition that he and others have been fighting so long for.But sitting at a Taipei cafe behind a laptop computer with a sticker that read, \u201cWhen dictatorship is a fact, revolution is a duty,\u201d Mr. Lin also acknowledged that Mr. Trump was an unlikely and perhaps unreliable ally.\u201cWe are not na\u00efve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the election of a new U.S. president will necessarily bring about huge changes. But if there\u2019s an opportunity, we will definitely not give it up.\u201dHuang Shih-han contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Test for Donald Trump on Social Security", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:I agree that we probably cannot count on the president-elect to protect Americans\u2019 retirement security. But your suggestion that \u201cmodest\u201d benefit cuts are needed to help preserve Social Security is off base.On the surface, it may seem fair to ask higher income earners to take a cut in benefits. But even \u201cmodest\u201d benefit cuts are a slippery slope: today, higher income earners; tomorrow, middle-income working Americans who truly can\u2019t afford benefit cuts.We can preserve Social Security without cutting anyone\u2019s earned benefits or undermining public support for the program. As you point out, raising the income cap on payroll taxes would be a great start.A small increase in the FICA tax rate \u2014 only 1/20th of 1 percent over 20 years \u2014 would also add to Social Security\u2019s long-term solvency.Instead of benefit cuts, benefit expansion should be at the top of the list for strengthening Social Security. The millions of Americans who depend on this cherished income security program deserve nothing less. MAX RICHTMANWashingtonThe writer is president and chief executive of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.To the Editor:Republican plans to lower benefits fly in the face of economic reality. Social Security payments are not saved; they are spent on food, clothing, medical care, recreation and so on. Reduce that spending, and the economy suffers. Not to mention, of course, that people suffer. That does not seem to bother Republicans.Furthermore, there is no logical reason to limit the tax to pay for Social Security to incomes of $118,500 or $250,000. If everyone can draw on it, then everyone\u2019s income, no matter how large, should be subject to the tax. This would eliminate any need to lower benefits or raise the retirement age.It would be very helpful if the media were more forceful in supporting the Social Security program. I don\u2019t hear much said about the benefits to children that Social Security provides if a parent dies. If people really focus on the fact that Social Security is not only an insurance program for the old but also for the young, perhaps there would be less opposition to paying the tax.If there is going to be another push by Republicans to water down Social Security, I hope that we can count on the media to resist it and to educate the public about its benefits. It is the bedrock of our safety net.MARGARET McGARRAHANBerkeley, Calif.To the Editor:One of the ideas for saving Social Security \u2014 the raising of the minimum age to 69 to \u201csave\u201d this American institution \u2014 is unrealistic in light of our American workers\u2019 needs.Has no one espousing this approach considered the men and women who do the heavy lifting in our society? The garbage man\u2019s daily lifting of heavy burdens, the carpenter who crawls on roof rafters, the stevedore, the commercial fisherman, those who are on their feet or doing other strenuous physical labor all day for years?These people, who start these jobs in their 20s, are many times burned out by their 50s. There are not enough jobs at a higher level for them to climb to a less demanding job, and so they join the ranks of the unemployed or underemployed.They haven\u2019t been able in their menial-pay jobs to create a retirement savings plan. Having contributed to Social Security, on what resources are they to live until they are 69? How are they to live on just that potentially reduced Social Security check when they do reach 69?A partial solution is indeed possible and pragmatic: Raise the level of wages subject to the Social Security tax; $118,500 is a small cutoff in this high-income country when so many are averaging above this old maximum.It is time for a change in Social Security: a thoughtful, empirically based answer to one of this society\u2019s basic tenets, which is appropriate support for all its citizens.

{"Headline": "Stoking Tensions With China", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byWhat\u2019s at StakeFor the foreseeable future, no relationship is more vital to international stability than that between the United States and China. Yet Donald Trump and the Chinese authorities have foolishly introduced dangerous new uncertainties into the equation.Maintaining a delicate balance on Taiwan\u2019s status has been a foundational principle of United States-China relations and crucial to maintaining peace in Asia. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade region that will eventually be incorporated in China, by force if necessary. Since 1978, the United States has recognized Beijing as China\u2019s sole government, breaking diplomatic ties with Taiwan a year later, but Washington continues to have unofficial ties with Taiwan, sells weapons to the self-governing island, and has hinted it may defend Taiwan if it is attacked.Such talk, some experts fear, might mean that Mr. Trump would formally recognize Taiwan or embolden Taiwan to declare independence from China, either of which would bring swift reprisals. Alternatively, some worry that if China offers the right deal, Mr. Trump might abandon Taiwan by ending cooperation and billions of dollars in arms sales. Such a shift would shake the foundations of every international alliance and partnership the United States has spent decades building.It\u2019s not uncommon for new presidents to put their own stamp on policy, even longstanding policy. But this requires assembling a staff and conducting a full review of the impact of any changes. Mr. Trump has few Asia experts in his circle, and some advisers have urged him to take up a hard line without any sense of long-term repercussions in the region.President Obama tried to manage a more assertive China by pursuing deeper military cooperation with smaller Asian nations and negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation agreement setting higher standards for trade. Mr. Trump has firmly rejected that deal, with no interest in renegotiating it. His early moves show only his intent to be a disrupter, no matter the consequences to American security.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growth, Not Forced Equality, Saves the Poor", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAnger about economic inequality in the United States dominated the presidential election. But while polemics about the issue have flourished across the political spectrum, clarity has not.Lack of clarity about inequality has been around for a long time. Look, for example, at the Illinois state constitution, adopted in 1970. It sought to \u201celiminate poverty and inequality.\u201dNote the linkage of poverty and inequality. It sounds good. Who wouldn\u2019t want to eliminate both of them?But think it through.Eliminating poverty is obviously good. And, happily, it is already happening on a global scale. The World Bank reports that the basics of a dignified life are more available to the poorest among us than at any time in history, by a big margin. Shanghai, a place of misery not very long ago, now looks like the most modern parts of the United States, though with better roads and bridges. The real income of India is doubling every 10 years. Sub-Saharan Africa is at last growing. Even in the rich countries, the poor are better off than they were in 1970, with better food and health care and, often, amenities like air-conditioning.We need to finish the job. But will we really help the poor by focusing on inequality?Anthony Trollope, the great English novelist, gave an answer in \u201cPhineas Finn\u201d in 1867. His liberal heroine suggests that \u201cmaking men and women all equal\u201d was \u201cthe gist of our political theory.\u201d No, replies her radical and more farseeing friend, \u201cequality is an ugly word, and frightens.\u201d A good person, he declares, should rather \u201cassist in lifting up those below him.\u201d Eliminate poverty, and let the distribution of wealth work.Economic growth has been accomplishing exactly that since 1800. Equality in the most important matters has increased steadily, through lifting up the wretched of the earth. The enrichment in fundamentals for the poor matters far more in the scheme of things than the acquisition of more Rolexes by the rich.What matters ethically is that the poor have a roof over their heads and enough to eat, and the opportunity to read and vote and get equal treatment by the police and courts. Enforcing the Voting Rights Act matters. Restraining police violence matters. Equalizing possession of Rolexes does not.The Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurt put it this way: \u201cEconomic equality is not, as such, of particular moral importance.\u201d Instead we should lift up the poor, in the style of Trollope\u2019s radical liberal, to a level Mr. Frankfurt labeled \u201cenough\u201d \u2014 enough for people to function in a democratic society and to have full human lives.Another eminent philosopher, John Rawls of Harvard, articulated what he called the Difference Principle: If the entrepreneurship of a rich person made the poorest better off, then the higher income of the entrepreneur was justified. It works for me.It is true that conspicuous displays of wealth are vulgar and irritating. But they are not something that a nonenvious principle of public policy needs to acknowledge.Poverty is never good. Difference, including economic difference, often is. It is why New Yorkers exchange goods with Californians and with people in Shanghai, and why the political railing against foreign trade is childish. It is why we converse, and why today is the great age of the novel and the memoir. It is why we celebrate diversity \u2014 or should.A practical objection to focusing on economic equality is that we cannot actually achieve it, not in a big society, not in a just and sensible way. Dividing up a pizza among friends can be done equitably, to be sure. But equality beyond the basics in consumption and in political rights isn\u2019t possible in a specialized and dynamic economy. Cutting down the tall poppies uses violence for the cut. And you need to know exactly which poppies to cut. Trusting a government of self-interested people to know how to redistribute ethically is na\u00efve.Another problem is that the cutting reduces the size of the crop. We need to allow for rewards that tell the economy to increase the activity earning them. If a brain surgeon and a taxi driver earn the same amount, we won\u2019t have enough brain surgeons. Why bother? An all-wise central plan could force the right people into the right jobs. But such a solution, like much of the case for a compelled equality, is violent and magical. The magic has been tried, in Stalin\u2019s Russia and Mao\u2019s China. So has the violence.Many of us share socialism in sentiment, if only because we grew up in loving families with Mom as the central planner. Sharing works just fine in a loving household. But it is not how grown-ups get stuff in a liberal society. Free adults get what they need by working to make goods and services for other people, and then exchanging them voluntarily. They don\u2019t get them by slicing up manna from Mother Nature in a zero-sum world.We could use state violence to take wealth from billionaires like Bill Gates and give it to the homeless, achieving more equality. (Mr. Gates is in fact giving away his fortune, to his credit.) Short of expropriation, we can and should join in supporting a safety net, keeping the violence to a minimum. K-12 public education, for example, should be paid for by compelled taxes on all of us. But we should not be doing a lot more.As a matter of arithmetic, expropriating the rich to give to the poor does not uplift the poor very much. If we took every dime from the top 20 percent of the income distribution and gave it to the bottom 80 percent, the bottom folk would be only 25 percent better off. If we took only from the superrich, the bottom would get less than that. And redistribution works only once. You can\u2019t expect the expropriated rich to show up for a second cutting. In a free society, they can move to Ireland or the Cayman Islands. And the wretched millionaires can hardly re-earn their millions next year if the state has taken most of the money.It is growth from exchange-tested betterment, not compelled or voluntary charity, that solves the problem of poverty. In South Korea, economic growth has increased the income of the poorest by a factor of 30 times real 1953 income. Which do we want, a small one-time (though envy-and-anger-satisfying) extraction from the rich, or a free society of betterment, one that lifts up the poor by gigantic amounts?We had better focus directly on the equality that we actually want and can achieve, which is equality of social dignity and equality before the law. Liberal equality, as against the socialist equality of enforced redistribution, eliminates the worst of poverty. It has done so spectacularly in Britain and Singapore and Botswana. More needs to be done, yes. Namely, more growth, which is sensitive to environmental limits and will require a proliferation of rich engineers. Let them have their money from devising carbon-fixing techniques and new sources of energy. It will enrich all of us.To borrow from the heroes of my youth, Marx and Engels: Working people of all countries unite! You have nothing to lose but stagnation! Demand exchange-tested betterment in a liberal society.Some dare call it capitalism.Deirdre N. McCloskey is professor emerita of economics, history, English and communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Niger Feels Ripple Effect of Boko Haram as Fears of Food Shortage Spread", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byDIFFA, Niger \u2014 Only 2 years old, Fatouma Ouseini lay in a hospital room, undernourished and listless from fever.Fatouma and her family fled from just across the border in northeastern Nigeria, the epicenter of the war with Boko Haram, where scattered areas have teetered on the brink of famine for most of this year, according to the United Nations. Now, some aid workers fear that similar conditions could spill over to bordering areas like here in Niger, putting even more children at risk.More than 70,000 people fled their homes along the border between Niger and Nigeria in the first half of this year after militant attacks increased. Many have resettled in Diffa, living in labyrinth-like neighborhoods of mud-brick homes, competing with longtime residents for food and water.Children like Fatouma are so common that the town\u2019s small hospital has dedicated an entire wing to treating malnutrition and the illnesses that stem from it.\u201cAt home, we had everything to eat and drink,\u201d said Hadja Mahamadou, Fatouma\u2019s aunt, who accompanied her to the hospital. \u201cHere, we\u2019re waiting always for food.\u201dEven in normal times, northeast Nigeria and areas along the borders of Niger, Cameroon and Chad often suffer from a lack of food. It is home to some of the poorest people and highest birthrates on the planet, and their fate often lies with the quality of the year\u2019s crop.But farming is all the more difficult now. Some farmers have shifted to only crops that grow close to the ground so militants cannot hide in fields. Some farmers are able to sleep in encampments for safety at night, returning periodically to check on crops.Elsewhere, the presence of militants has prevented farmers from going to their fields. In some areas, farmers have missed the last three harvest seasons.Nigeria has been particularly hard hit. It continues to writhe from a drop in oil prices that set off a currency devaluation and now a recession. Food prices have soared even in major cities far from areas where Boko Haram operates. High prices have rippled into neighboring countries that rely on Nigeria for trade.Some aid workers complain that Nigeria\u2019s government, which prides itself on being one of Africa\u2019s biggest economies, had been reluctant to accept help from food delivery groups until this summer. This fall, a Nigerian Senate report said $8 million in aid meant for the northeast had been misallocated or had disappeared.President Muhammadu Buhari, who pledged during his campaign to rid the country of Boko Haram after years of torment, has declared the militants defeated despite their continued attacks.This month, the United Nations announced that it needed about three times as much money as it originally expected to mitigate the food crisis and other problems in the region, which are likely to continue in Nigeria at least until the harvest season at the end of 2017. The organization, which has struggled to raise money to help the region, is now asking for $1 billion for northeastern Nigeria.\u201cWe have underestimated the scale and complexity of the crisis in northern Nigeria,\u201d said Peter Lundberg, the United Nations\u2019 deputy humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria.Mr. Buhari immediately dismissed the appeal, insisting that the world organization was exaggerating the humanitarian crisis in his country to increase donations. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Mr. Buhari said the United Nations was engaging in \u201ca type of hype that does not provide a solution to the situation on the ground but more to do with calculations for operations financing locally and abroad.\u201dLater, the government\u2019s official Twitter account posted that it recognized the severity of the humanitarian situation.While crediting the United Nations with immeasurable help to assuage the food situation, Mr. Buhari said, \u201cThe hype, especially that which suggests that the government is doing nothing is, therefore, uncharitable and unnecessary,\u201d according to the statement.\u201cWe are concerned about the blatant attempts to whip up a nonexistent fear of mass starvation by some aid agencies, a type of hype that does not provide a solution to the situation on the ground but more to do with calculations for operations financing locally and abroad,\u201d the statement said.Col. Adamu Laka of the Nigerian military said some areas of Nigeria \u2014 like Bama, a city where humanitarian groups had described severe malnourishment after it was liberated from Boko Haram control in June \u2014 were so flush with food that the military had told the authorities to slow shipments. But he said few farmers in the area had cultivated their own fields and instead were relying on relief food.\u201cRight now, there is no problem of food in Bama,\u201d he said. But if the relief stops, \u201cthat is when there will be a problem.\u201dIn Nigeria, the threat of militants has blocked access for aid groups like the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program to some villages until midyear. The organization initially handed out cash and vouchers for food, a system that officials now acknowledge was a mistake in an area where inflation had set in. Now, the United Nations is directly distributing rice and other food.But encampments of displaced people, even in the accessible and relatively safe Nigerian city of Maiduguri, with its huge markets, still lack enough food and water. A United Nations assessment showed that one informal camp called Muna Garage, home to 17,000 people who have fled militants, is in dire need of water wells and food.\u201cNo one here is dying of starvation, but with chronic malnutrition, when they get malaria or any other communicable disease, they die from it,\u201d said Mr. Lundberg, who acknowledged past gaps in the agency\u2019s handling of the food crisis.Poor coordination and major turnover in leadership have dogged agencies of the United Nations, criticisms that were pointed out in a stinging letter sent last month to the organization\u2019s emergency directors by officials at the European Union.\u201cRecent reports indicate that even where access is relatively good, like in parts of Maiduguri, scaled-up delivery has been inadequate and emergency conditions prevail for the local population,\u201d the letter said.Mr. Lundberg conceded the criticisms but said they were outdated. The organization recently set up offices in northeast Nigeria, brought in experts who dealt with famine in South Sudan and is working \u201cin a completely different way to address the gaps that clearly were there.\u201dHere in Niger, humanitarian workers say food deliveries are flowing. At one encampment outside Diffa on a blazing recent afternoon, hundreds of people gathered alongside a truck for handouts from the International Rescue Committee with pink bags of Happy Family brand rice, macaroni, palm oil, bouillon and other food.Fati Fougou, 40, who has been running from Boko Haram for two years, had been waiting for the shipment since she returned from morning prayers. She said each ration was supposed to be a month\u2019s worth of food for one family. But hers, intended to feed her and her seven children, generally runs out after 25 days.\u201cIt\u2019s not sufficient,\u201d Ms. Fougou said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have.\u201dChris Stein contributed reporting from Lagos, Nigeria.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Long-Term Jobs Killer Is Not China. It\u2019s Automation.", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byRobot RevolutionThe first job that Sherry Johnson, 56, lost to automation was at the local newspaper in Marietta, Ga., where she fed paper into the printing machines and laid out pages. Later, she watched machines learn to do her jobs on a factory floor making breathing machines, and in inventory and filing.\u201cIt actually kind of ticked me off because it\u2019s like, How are we supposed to make a living?\u201d she said. She took a computer class at Goodwill, but it was too little too late. \u201cThe 20- and 30-year-olds are more up to date on that stuff than we are because we didn\u2019t have that when we were growing up,\u201d said Ms. Johnson, who is now on disability and lives in a housing project in Jefferson City, Tenn.Donald J. Trump told workers like Ms. Johnson that he would bring back their jobs by clamping down on trade, offshoring and immigration. But economists say the bigger threat to their jobs has been something else: automation.No candidate talked much about automation on the campaign trail. Technology is not as convenient a villain as China or Mexico, there is no clear way to stop it, and many of the technology companies are in the United States and benefit the country in many ways.When Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, agreed to invest $16 million in one of its Carrier factories as part of a Trump deal to keep some jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico, he said the money would go toward automation.Robert Stilwell, 35, of Evansville, Ind., is one of them. He did not graduate from high school and worked in factories building parts for tools and cars, wrapping them up and loading them onto trucks. After he was laid off, he got a job as a convenience store cashier, which pays a lot less.\u201cI used to have a really good job, and I liked the people I worked with \u2014 until it got overtaken by a machine, and then I was let go,\u201d he said.Dennis Kriebel\u2019s last job was as a supervisor at an aluminum extrusion factory, where he had spent a decade punching out parts for cars and tractors. Then, about five years ago, he lost it to a robot.\u201cEverything we did, you could program a robot to do it,\u201d said Mr. Kriebel, who is 55 and lives in Youngstown, Ohio, the town about which Bruce Springsteen sang, \u201cSeven hundred tons of metal a day/Now sir you tell me the world\u2019s changed.\u201dSince then, Mr. Kriebel has barely been scraping by doing odd jobs. Many of the new jobs at factories require technical skills, but he doesn\u2019t own a computer and doesn\u2019t want to.Labor economists say there are ways to ease the transition for workers whose jobs have been displaced by robots. They include retraining programs, stronger unions, more public-sector jobs, a higher minimum wage, a bigger earned-income tax credit and, for the next generation of workers, more college degrees. The White House on Tuesday released a report on automation and the economy that called for better education from early childhood through adult job transitions and for updating the social safety net with tools like wage insurance. Few are policies that Mr. Trump has said he will pursue.\u201cJust allowing the private market to automate without any support is a recipe for blaming immigrants and trade and other things, even when it\u2019s the long impact of technology,\u201d said Mr. Katz, who was the Labor Department\u2019s chief economist under President Clinton.Ms. Johnson in Tennessee said both her favorite and highest-paying job, at $8.65 an hour, was at an animal shelter, caring for puppies.It was also the least likely to be done by a machine, she said: \u201cI would hope a computer couldn\u2019t do that, unless they like changing dirty papers and giving them love and attention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman President Named Trump Adviser, Opening Door for Younger Executives", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byThe jockeying to be the next chief executive of Goldman Sachs is expected to intensify after President-elect Donald J. Trump officially asked the firm\u2019s president, Gary D. Cohn, to become his top economic policy adviser on Monday.Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure from the top ranks of the Wall Street firm removes a crucial impediment for the next generation of Goldman leaders because he was seen as the natural heir to the top spot. Mr. Cohn is among a handful of senior executives who have held sway atop Goldman since before the financial crisis, and he is among the last of them to leave, even as Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman, seems in no hurry to step down.Goldman is expected to announce a new slate of deputies to Mr. Blankfein in coming days, including the naming of two co-presidents \u2014 a role Mr. Cohn initially shared with Jon Winkelried until the latter\u2019s departure in 2009.Goldman named 84 new partners this year, more than its previous partner class two years ago. Wall Street banks have been constrained by new regulations cutting into big businesses, such as trading, and pinching profit margins \u2014 reasons Goldman has been expanding into new areas like consumer banking.The firm is moving into the future with the wind at its back, after several years spent battling the financial crisis and the regulations that arose from it, which generally hit Goldman harder than other banks.During the presidential campaign, it looked as if the pressure on Goldman would continue. Mr. Trump blasted Hillary Clinton for her ties to the firm and hinted in ominous tones about the company\u2019s outsize role in shaping the country\u2019s policy.But since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, he has looked to Goldman Sachs veterans to stock his administration. In addition to the appointment of Mr. Cohn, the former Goldman executive Steven Mnuchin was tapped as Treasury secretary, and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a Goldman alumnus.Mr. Trump has also talked about rolling back the financial regulations that have reined in Goldman\u2019s famous trading operations in recent years and crimped its profits.In addition, the anticipation of big spending programs by the government under Mr. Trump has helped to push interest rates up, which generally helps financial firms like Goldman.Most banks have had their stocks rise since the election, but Goldman\u2019s shares have experienced immense gains, rising by nearly a third since early November.He added: \u201cToday, for a variety of reasons, capital and regulatory reasons, the competitive landscape has changed pretty dramatically. And we\u2019re as uniquely positioned as we ever have been in the competitive landscape.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s transition team officially announced on Monday that Mr. Cohn would be his assistant on economic policy and the director of his National Economic Council, a move that had been expected since last Friday.\u201cAs my top economic adviser, Gary Cohn is going to put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe fully understands the economy and will use all of his vast knowledge and experience to make sure the American people start winning again.\u201dMr. Cohn has been with Goldman Sachs since 1990 and rose up as a trader alongside Mr. Blankfein.\u201cGary and I have been partners for more than 25 years, so I know better than perhaps anyone that he has the intelligence, commitment and experience to be successful at any endeavor he undertakes,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said in a statement on Monday.In his own statement, Mr. Cohn said, \u201cI share President-elect Trump\u2019s vision of making sure every American worker has a secure place in a thriving economy, and we will be completely committed to building a nation of strength, growth and prosperity.\u201dMr. Cohn is a particularly unlikely choice for the Trump administration because he has been a registered Democrat and has, in public appearances, reflected the sort of internationalist view of the economy that Mr. Trump has often criticized.At a conference in Florida soon after the election, Mr. Cohn said the big problem facing the country and the world was a \u201cglobal growth issue.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve it with domestic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201dThe job that Mr. Cohn is expected to accept has long been identified with Goldman and its influence in the capital.The role of N.E.C. director was established by President Bill Clinton and given to Robert E. Rubin, Goldman\u2019s co-chairman at the time. Stephen Friedman, who served as co-chairman with Mr. Rubin, later held the economic adviser position under President George W. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Weather Italy Referendum Result, but Banks Are Vulnerable", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byStocks in Europe and the United States rose, and the euro recovered from early losses \u2014 a reaction that was muted in part because opinion polls had predicted the \u201cno\u201d vote, giving investors time to adjust their portfolios, and also because political instability in Rome is not exactly unusual.But analysts said the potential for market turmoil remained if the vote resulted in a long period of government paralysis and delayed plans to fix Italy\u2019s ailing banks, whose shares fell sharply on Monday.\u201cIt will be very much related to two factors,\u201d said Nicola Nobile, a senior European economist at Oxford Economics in Milan. \u201cWhat is going to happen to the banking system, and if we\u2019re going to have a government soon.\u201dThe vote was another sign of popular resistance across Europe to changes that economists say are needed for the 19-country eurozone to overcome problems that have threatened its existence. Such overhauls are particularly urgent in Italy, which has had no lasting growth for a decade and is the second-most-indebted country in the eurozone after Greece.The European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council, which is scheduled to meet on Thursday, is expected to extend its purchases of eurozone government bonds to hold down borrowing rates. But analysts say that central bank measures cannot keep the currency bloc together indefinitely if its members are unwilling to take steps that are essential to growth.The political uncertainty caused by the vote will postpone plans to rebuild Italian banks and to help them deal with problem loans, which account for nearly a fifth of total debt and are a serious drag on the economy.Though market interest rates, or yields, on government bonds rose across Europe \u2014 indicating that investors now consider the region to be a riskier place to put their money \u2014 the increase was highest in Italy, a sign of the heightened uncertainty over the country\u2019s prospects. American Treasuries followed European bonds lower, sending yields up.After the vote, the euro initially fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading, but it recovered by the morning in Europe and even gained ground compared with last week. Major European and United States stock markets were all slightly higher as well.Political instability will make it even more difficult than it already was for Monte dei Paschi to raise the 5 billion euros, or $5.3 billion, it needs to clean up its portfolio of bad loans. Mr. Renzi\u2019s government had been trying to encourage reluctant investors to put up the money.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.In the worst-case scenario, the bank would not be able to raise the money and there would be a so-called bail-in of the lender in which shareholders, bondholders and depositors would bear the losses.\u201cThat would be quite painful for the banking system,\u201d Mr. Nobile said. \u201cThe negative reaction would not just be with Monte dei Paschi.\u201dShares in Monte dei Paschi were down 3.5 percent in afternoon trading while the shares of UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, fell 6 percent before paring some of the losses.UniCredit has scheduled an investor presentation for next week and had been expected to outline plans to raise more capital. The timing of the presentation now looks unfortunate.Problems at Italian banks could spread across the eurozone. Large banks around the Continent continually lend money to one another, which allows problems at one institution to spread quickly.European banks have lent \u20ac385 billion to Italian banks, or slightly less than 2 percent of total credit, according to analysts at Credit Suisse. BNP Paribas of France is the most vulnerable, with just under 10 percent of its outstanding loans in Italy. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank in Germany have about 3 percent of their credit portfolios in Italy, according to Credit Suisse, which said the sums are not large enough to undermine the eurozone banking system.However, history shows that the extent of banks\u2019 exposure to one another does not usually become clear until a large lender gets in trouble.In the worst case, Italy could again be at the center of a crisis like the one that nearly destroyed the eurozone in 2011. The vote could set off a political chain reaction leading to a government headed by the populist Five Star Movement.\u201cThe risk in Italy is that a Five Star party-led government is coming next, and it will move to pull Italy out of the E.U.,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cThat prospect undermines the creditworthiness proposition underlying Italian bonds.\u201dThere is danger of a vicious circle if the Italian economy sags. More businesses and consumers would have trouble paying their debts, and the number of problem loans could rise further. Bad loans are a dead weight on the Italian economy, because they prevent banks from providing credit needed for businesses to expand. And problems at Italian banks would become even more intractable.Italy\u2019s national debt is equal to 136 percent of gross domestic product. The government depends on investors willing to continue rolling over the debt at reasonable interest rates.Investors have already been demanding a higher premium on Italian bonds. The yield on Italian 10-year government bonds has nearly doubled since August, to around 2 percent. That is still far below the more than 7 percent reached in late 2011, during the darkest days of the eurozone financial crisis. But the increase is a sign that investors consider the bonds to be more risky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On a Japanese Whiskey Tour, Small Batches and Bagpipes", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byPursuitsOne of the many discoveries I made on my first night in Japan nearly 30 years ago were the vending machines that sold beer. As I walked to my new apartment just hours after landing in Tokyo, I found a machine stocked with different sizes of cans and brands. It was a eureka moment.Then I saw something more bewildering: a small bottle of whiskey. I was impressed that it was sold in a vending machine but skeptical that it was any good. In a fit of caution, I opted for a few beers.Over the next dozen years that I lived in Tokyo, when I saw Japanese whiskey, it was almost always in pubs where businessmen diluted it with water or ice to make it easier to drink. Back then, domestic whiskey was considered inferior to the Scottish original. One Japanese friend was so smitten with the Glenlivet I gave him he kept the bottle long after he emptied it.Over the last 20 years or so, Suntory and Nikka, Japan\u2019s other large distiller, had begun producing award-winning single malts that connoisseurs now covet. The four-figure prices for bottles of some of them confirmed how late I was to the party.So this spring, on a trip to Tokyo, my wife and I decided to see what the fuss was about, taking side trips to distilleries owned by three of the best-regarded makers, Nikka, Chichibu and Suntory.Taketsuru was the scion of an old sake brewing family who traveled to Scotland in 1918 to learn how to make whiskey and returned in 1920 with a Scottish bride.Taketsuru went to work for Shinjiro Torii, the founder of what would become Suntory. With Taketsuru\u2019s technical know-how and Torii\u2019s business savvy, they opened a distillery in 1924 in Mishima-gun, about halfway between Osaka and Kyoto. After some early hiccups, they introduced whiskey to the masses.But Taketsuru wanted to make whiskey in a place that approximated Scotland. So in 1934, he and three investors opened a rival distillery that became Nikka, in Yoichi, on the northern island of Hokkaido.Taketsuru\u2019s central role in the birth of Japanese whiskey made Yoichi a logical place to start our tour. We found a package plan that included round-trip tickets on ANA and a night in a Western-style hotel in Sapporo for less than $300 per person.After the 90-minute flight to Sapporo, we caught the Airport Express train to the city center and walked a few minutes to our hotel. The rooms were small, tidy and included breakfast.The next morning, we took a two-car train that hugged the coastline to Yoichi. We quickly saw why Taketsuru set up shop here. The town is surrounded by hills on three sides and faces the Sea of Japan, and the salt air and fresh water evoke Scotland.Outside the station, we saw the gray brick walls of the distillery a few blocks away on Rita Road, named in honor of Taketsuru\u2019s wife, Rita Cowan Taketsuru. Bagpipe music blared over the loud speakers in town.At the gate, two receptionists in red-and-black tartan outfits greeted us. The free guided tours were only in Japanese, but plenty of tourists wandered around, English pamphlets in hand. Busloads of schoolchildren, Chinese tourists and groups of Japanese senior citizens paraded past the buildings and raided the gift shop.We were lucky to be taken around by Naoki Tomoyoshi, an award-winning bartender who is now the chief of international sales and marketing.Mr. Tomoyoshi explained that there is roughly a 10-year lag between production and demand for good whiskey, and during Japan\u2019s go-go years in the 1980s, Nikka cranked up production to meet demand. As the economy slowed, Nikka drew down its inventory. Now that demand has rebounded, Nikka is playing catch-up.\u201cThe impact of \u2018Massan\u2019 has been very positive, which can sometimes be a negative in the whiskey business,\u201d Mr. Tomoyoshi said. \u201cWhiskey doesn\u2019t happen in two weeks like beer.\u201dThe urgency was not apparent at the stately distillery, where you could almost imagine old man Taketsuru wandering around mulling his next creation. The S-shaped trail that bisected the grounds, my wife thought, was a metaphor for the long and winding journey that it takes to make whiskey.The highlight was the distillation room, where the pot stills were heated with coal, rarely used elsewhere because of environmental restrictions. Like a scene out of the Industrial Age, workers in factory smocks shoveled piles of coal into the furnace beneath the pot stills every few minutes.Mr. Tomoyoshi said that using coal to maintain a temperature of between 1,472 and 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit was less precise than more easily controlled sources of heat, but the uneven temperatures created more unpredictable flavors as a result.Nearby was the Taketsurus\u2019s modest wooden home. We peeked at the kitchen and the living room, which looked as if little had changed since the 1950s, when the couple lived there. (Rita died in 1961, Taketsuru in 1979.) Taketsuru drank only in a room with the traditional tatami mats, and his flask was still there.Given how instrumental Taketsuru was to Nikka and Suntory, it was disappointing that there was no mention in the Nikka museum that he worked elsewhere.Born into a 350-year-old sake brewing family, Mr. Akuto worked for Suntory before joining the whiskey distillery that his grandfather started in 1946. After sales faltered, his father sold the company.Mr. Akuto, though, acquired the 400 casks in inventory and started his own company, Venture Whisky. (Many Japanese distillers use the Scottish spelling of whiskey, without the e.) To buy time, he bottled his father\u2019s whiskey and went bar to bar in the Tokyo area to win over bartenders.It took Mr. Akuto two years to sell his first 600 bottles. But after he started winning awards, his whiskeys shot up in price. During our visit, we could see why. He makes everything in small batches with an obsessive attention to detail, and adds some interesting twists, like a fermentation tank called a washback made of mizunara oak, a wood indigenous to Japan that is typically used for casks.One of Mr. Akuto\u2019s novel ideas was to blend his father\u2019s inventory with his new whiskeys. I fell in love with one named, aptly, Double Distilleries, which was sweet and sharp at once. I had to restrain myself from finishing the samples that were left out for us to taste and was crushed to learn that Mr. Akuto lacked a license to sell retail, so I left empty-handed.It wasn\u2019t hard to root for Mr. Akuto. In our hourlong talk, he was knowledgeable but modest, and said his goal was not to beat Nikka or Suntory, or even to earn a lot of money.\u201cAs for my dream or motivation, I want to drink 30-year-old whiskey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 22 more years. If I can drink it, I think I\u2019ll die having lived a good life.\u201dWe rode the bullet train to Kyoto and changed to a local train heading to Osaka. About 20 minutes later we got off at Yamazaki Station and walked 10 minutes to the distillery, the smell of malted barley in the air.The spot is ideal because of the easy access to Kyoto and Osaka, and because the Katsura, Kizu and Uji Rivers meet nearby and provide fresh water. These days, a visit to the distillery is as much as about the company\u2019s history as it is the ingredients that go into the whiskeys.As in Yoichi, the cult of the founder was ever-present. We saw busts of Torii and his son and successor, Keizo Saji, who pushed the company to develop premium whiskey. The museum made no mention of Taketsuru, but had a fascinating collection of bottles, labels and advertisements.Then Shinji Fukuyo, Suntory\u2019s chief blender, took us around the distillery, which dwarfed anything we saw in Yoichi and Chichibu. There were, for instance, five pairs of pot stills in the distillation room and about a million casks of whiskey, including a C\u00e1diz sherry cask dating back to 1924. The inventory is so vast that Mr. Fukuyo\u2019s team can only test a fraction of the enormous stock each year.The real fun was talking to Mr. Fukuyo about his job. He sometimes tastes dozens of samples a day, and has to translate his impressions to a team of scientists who adjust batches accordingly. He avoids broiled fish, coffee and other foods that interfere with his taste buds.The son of a police detective, Mr. Fukuyo looked like an engineer in his white factory jacket with maroon trim. But he explained that making whiskey is a guessing game. No one, he said, knows what consumers will want in 10 or 20 years, and even if he or she did, the whiskey now aging will change depending on the weather, the casks and other factors that are difficult to control.Mr. Fukuyo quoted his predecessor, who likened the process to the career of a famous Japanese singer, Harumi Miyako. She still sings the same songs as she always did, sounding slightly different over the years, he said. \u201cBut the same person is singing, so it\u2019s the same. It\u2019s like a Zen question and answer.\u201dAt the end of the tour, Mr. Fukuyo showed us four whiskeys that would be mixed with others to make new creations. The lightest was aged in American oak and reminded me of bourbon. The second sample was darker and aged in mizunara oak, which gave it a spicy aftertaste. Then we tasted a darker whiskey aged in Spanish oak that gave off a heavy hint of fruit. The last one was the smokiest and tasted a bit medicinal. We poured a splash of water in each glass and marveled at the new fragrances that arose.We ordered whiskey samplers that included glasses of Miyagikyo and Yoichi from Nikka and glasses of 12-year-old Hakushu and 12-year-old Yamazaki from Suntory. In years past, I would have fumbled for the vocabulary to describe them. Now, I could identify the hint of sea salt in the Yoichi and the aroma of fruit and mizunara oak in the Yamazaki. Whiskey \u2014 or at least the Japanese variety \u2014 was no longer lost in translation.WHAT TO SEEWHERE TO STAYWHERE TO EATThere are few places to eat of note near the distilleries, but Nikka and Suntory have modest restaurants on their properties.Before or after visiting the distillery in Chichibu, consider eating near the train station, where there are several soba noodle restaurants.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Play the Trump Stock Market Rally", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byFundamentally\u201cIf you have big tax cuts and more infrastructure and defense spending, that adds to demand, which is likely to spell inflation,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds.That is partly why shares of big banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase and blue-chip industrial companies like Caterpillar and General Dynamics have surged since election night.But after more than a month of this rally, value-minded investors think it may be time to start looking for bargains in areas of the market that have been left behind.\u201cThe biggest opportunity is in the international markets,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \u201cThose stocks are getting pounded by one big factor \u2014 the dollar.\u201dA strong dollar not only reduces the value of gains that Americans enjoy on their overseas investments, but it also serves as a headwind to domestic companies as a strengthening currency makes their goods more expensive to foreign buyers.In the immediate aftermath of the election, the dollar surged as much as 4 percent against a basket of foreign currencies, on the belief that market interest rates in the United States would keep rising and the Federal Reserve would start lifting short-term rates, too. Both moves would provide greater incentives for global investors to park their cash in dollar-denominated assets.But Mr. Paulsen looked at the start of the last five periods in which the Federal Reserve began a sustained campaign to raise short-term rates. \u201cEvery one of those times was associated with a decline in the dollar,\u201d he said, not a rise.While it\u2019s true that rising bond yields can strengthen the dollar, rates are often raised to stave off inflation, and that can hurt a currency. If the Federal Reserve starts hiking rates this month because it sees a need to quell inflation, that could weaken the dollar, Mr. Paulsen said.\u201cIf the dollar comes down,\u201d he said, \u201cthat definitely brings the foreign markets, particularly the emerging markets, into play.\u201dLewis J. Altfest, chief investment officer for Altfest Personal Wealth Management, concurs with this logic and is adding to his investments in emerging market equities, he said, especially after they\u2019ve taken another hit. Since the Nov. 8 election, emerging market shares such as the Chinese internet giant Tencent have fallen, while a broad range of shares in the American market have gained.Historically, emerging market stocks have traded at roughly a 15 percent discount to United States shares based on price/earnings ratios that rely on five years of averaged profits, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group.Today, that has widened to a near 50 percent discount.Emerging market stocks weren\u2019t the only investments that had taken a hit because of rising interest rates lately.In the aftermath of the election, the yield on 10-year Treasuries jumped to 2.4 percent, while 30-year Treasury yields rose to 3.1 percent. Both are up a full percentage point from their levels this summer, which helps to explain why the average long-term government bond mutual fund fell more than 7 percent in the month after the election.In any case, bond investors may have overreacted in selling.The same goes for Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s speculation about new longer-dated bonds. It could take years for the Treasury to actually issue such bonds, Ms. Jones said, and as that realization takes hold and selling slows down, there may be some short-term opportunities in Treasuries, she added.Investors may want to consider sectors that have underperformed during this postelection surge, even if they haven\u2019t declined.Take technology. American tech stocks haven\u2019t moved much since election night.Why? Conventional wisdom said that the new president\u2019s views on immigration and trade would hurt tech companies the most, in part because these firms generate a greater portion of their sales overseas \u2014 58 percent \u2014 than any other sector of the market, according to FactSet, a financial research firm.But Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank, said the Trump administration\u2019s incipient economic goals appear to be threefold. \u201cThe first is to grow the economic pie, and then to widen the slices of both wages for workers and profits for companies,\u201d he said.To accomplish that, the economy would need to increase productivity. \u201cUltimately, business investment has to be part of the solution, and because of that, tech will be critical,\u201d Mr. Ablin added.This may not directly help consumer-focused companies like Apple, \u201cbut this should be good news to tech companies that sell to other businesses, like Salesforce.com,\u201d Mr. Ablin said.Health care is another fertile area to consider, market strategists say. While big pharmaceutical companies rallied immediately after the election \u2014 on the assumption that a Trump administration will relax regulations \u2014 other parts of the sector have been largely flat on uncertainties surrounding the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Medical equipment stocks, for instance, have slumped on fears that if Obamacare is eliminated and fewer Americans are insured, hospitals will purchase less new equipment.\u201cHealth care is an interesting area postelection because there is still so much uncertainty about Obamacare,\u201d said Mary L. Pierson, co-manager of Fairpointe Capital\u2019s mid-cap stock strategy.Yet Ms. Pierson noted that some equipment makers are likely to grow with or without Obamacare, citing Varian Medical Systems, an equipment manufacturer based in Palo Alto, Calif., that makes devices for radiotherapy used in treating various forms of cancer. The company generates more than 50 percent of its revenues overseas. What\u2019s more, nearly 95 percent of all radiotherapy equipment installations over the next decade are expected to be handled by just two firms \u2014 Varian and its rival, Elekta.Ms. Pierson sees Varian\u2019s mediocre postelection performance as \u201can opportunity for us to add to our position.\u201dPaul J.

{"Headline": "The 5 Easiest and 5 Most Difficult Promises for Donald Trump to Keep", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump made many sweeping promises on his way to victory on Election Day. After he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, here are five of the most difficult and five of the easiest promises to keep:THE DIFFICULT ONESPrevent American companies from moving jobs to other countries.Companies move to other countries to pursue higher profits, and Mr. Trump cannot force them to stay. The question is whether he can make it profitable to do so. It is difficult because labor is much cheaper in other countries. Carrier pays workers at its Indiana factory an average hourly wage of $23 \u2014 roughly four times what it plans to pay workers with the same jobs in Mexico.Mr. Trump has promised tax cuts and regulatory relief, but those are minor expenses for most companies, particularly in comparison to their payrolls. Mr. Trump also has threatened to impose new taxes on imports, but he cannot target particular companies. Any such tariffs would have to be broad \u2014 and therefore broadly painful.Revive American steel-making and coal-mining industries.The productivity of the American coal industry has increased roughly tenfold since the end of World War II. The work that once required 10 miners now requires just one. Steel making has undergone a similar transformation. That is by far the most important reason employment in both industries has declined precipitously. Most of those jobs are never coming back.Demand for coal has also declined thanks to a revolution in the production of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, other alternative energy sources. This, too, is a development that Mr. Trump lacks the power to reverse.Increase American economic growth to more than 4 percent a year.There are only two ways to increase economic growth: Increase the number of workers, or increase productivity, the amount the average worker produces. The news is not good on either front. The growth of the American work force is slowing as baby boomers retire and families have fewer children. And Mr. Trump has promised new restrictions on immigration, limiting another source of workers. At the same time, productivity has increased over the last decade at an average annual pace of just 1.3 percent \u2014 and there is little evidence that faster growth is in the offing.The result is that annual economic growth has averaged 2.1 percent in the six full years since the last recession, and is on a similar trajectory this year. There are few obvious means for Mr. Trump to deliver on his promise.Invest in infrastructure to create jobs.Mr. Trump will find bipartisan support in Congress for his proposal to create jobs and stimulate the economy by building and repairing highways, bridges, water systems and other public works. But many Republicans may balk at a big spending program that adds to the federal budget deficit.Some Democrats will resist Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to offer tax breaks to private companies in return for infrastructure investments, notably because the federal government is able to borrow money at exceptionally low rates. Democrats are also likely to resist efforts to waive environmental rules or prevailing-wage protections for construction projects.Build a border wall.Fences already exist along hundreds of miles of the border. Mexico has said it will not pay for a wall. And even if it did, Mr. Trump would probably need approval from Congress to spend money. Mr. Trump could do much to beef up border security on his own. Congress would support increased border security and the installation of more fencing, but construction of a wall would meet resistance from both parties.THE EASIER ONESWithdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Though Mr. Trump has the authority to carry out this promise, other participants, including Japan and Australia, have expressed hope that he will reconsider. If not, they may pursue regional trade deals that exclude the United States.End the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.The program, which President Obama announced to protect undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors, was created by presidential fiat and it can be ended just as easily. Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to do so. He has not said whether he will deprive current participants of protection, or simply prevent new enrollments.Allow the Keystone XL pipeline to move forward.Mr. Trump has encouraged the company behind the project, TransCanada, to submit a new application once he takes office. He also has suggested, however, that TransCanada should share its profits with taxpayers.Nominate a Supreme Court justice. Reduce federal business and personal taxes.Mr. Trump has promised to reduce federal taxation of businesses and households. Congressional Republicans have expressed support for a broadly similar approach. The details have derailed past efforts to overhaul the tax code, but Republican control of both Congress and the White House increases the chances that Mr. Trump will succeed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Taiwan, a Dilemma Over Identity, Economy and China", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported bySinosphereYour book deals with the seeming contradiction of China and Taiwan developing closer economic ties, even as Taiwanese culture moves further away from China\u2019s. How have those trends managed to emerge simultaneously?Once China began to open its economy in the post-Mao era, cultural similarities and a common political objective of creating \u201cone China\u201d led to an explosion of economic relations across the strait. The Chinese economy was highly complementary to Taiwan\u2019s, and a majority of Taiwanese considered themselves \u201cChinese.\u201d Today, more than two-thirds of Taiwan\u2019s outward foreign direct investment is to China, which is also Taiwan\u2019s leading trading partner.However, as cross-strait economic interdependence grew and as Taiwan began to democratize, the residents of the island began to debate what it meant to be Taiwanese, a topic that had been taboo for four decades under the authoritarian Kuomintang government. At first, Taiwan\u2019s economic policy toward China oscillated between extreme restriction and extreme liberalization. Some Taiwanese believed supporting economic liberalization with China was a way of promoting unification, while supporting economic restriction with China was equivalent to preserving a separate Taiwan, whether that be simply autonomy or outright independence.Do you see any way that Taiwanese identity could move closer to China\u2019s in the coming decades?Nonetheless, it is entirely possible for this identity to swing back to become more Chinese. This will depend on the strategy Beijing employs, especially whether it can create a common identity that includes Taiwanese. But if Beijing stays the course by imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions while providing economic benefits to a select few, it will create more backlash and resentment \u2014 just as it has in Hong Kong. Alternatively, Beijing could choose to close the gap across the strait by fostering democratic values and allowing the emergence of civil society, but this seems highly unlikely at present.What are the economic implications of the Trump administration for Taiwan? Your book focuses on the China-Taiwan relationship, but what do you make of the recent Trump-Tsai telephone call and the impact that could have on the cross-strait relationship?The call President-elect Donald Trump accepted from President Tsai alarmed many experts. Some fear the call will destabilize U.S.-China relations, while others saw it as a welcome sign of upgraded U.S.-Taiwan relations. I do not believe there is evidence of a major policy change yet. But if Trump views Taiwan simply as a way to put pressure on Beijing, then that would mean Taiwan is regarded merely as a means to an end, rather than important to the U.S. in its own right. Is there a space for Ms. Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party-led government to find a balance on cross-straits issues that Beijing can find acceptable? Or do you expect Beijing to be obstinate in its attempts to freeze out the D.P.P.?Tsai has already made compromises that go too far for many of her supporters. In her inaugural speech, Tsai referred to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the legislation governing cross-strait relations, both of which imply the acceptance of a \u201cone China\u201d framework. Tsai may not have room to move much further, especially if Beijing continues to freeze out the D.P.P.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Smuggled TV Shows Change North Korea?", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThese illicit TV shows, movies and radio programs are helping to transform how North Koreans see the outside world, and more important, how they view their government. Interviews with defectors and research in the country make clear that seeds of doubt about the regime are being planted in North Koreans\u2019 minds, prompting new ideas and more autonomous thinking.Foreign media alone will not rapidly transform the country, but the trend offers hope for incremental political change.During the Cold War, the United States sponsored information programs aimed at Soviet citizens with the hope of creating internal pressure for liberalization. Banned literature, radio programs and magazines circulated within the Soviet bloc with the help of anti-Soviet \u00e9migr\u00e9s.It worked. The information helped undermine the Soviet government\u2019s claim that Communism was a superior form of government. The spread of information in North Korea could have the same effect.North Korea\u2019s information underground has its origin in the famine of two decades ago, which killed 800,000 to two million people. With the government\u2019s distribution system unable to meet their needs, North Koreans turned to unofficial and illegal markets. Today an estimated two-thirds of the population depends on the hundreds of street markets for food and other goods, including foreign media. A nascent market economy has taken root.A 24-year-old defector from Musan, North Korea, who described herself as a foreign movie fanatic when she still lived in the North, told me that she had learned in textbooks that South Koreans ran around naked and starving because they were so poor. But South Korean movies showed her that her teachers were teaching falsehoods. \u201cI quickly realized that South Korea was more developed than North Korea,\u201d she told me.Defector interviews and research about the North help paint a picture of a country undergoing social and political change.More North Koreans are engaging in illegal social activities and behavior, including mimicking Seoul-style ways of speaking and wearing unapproved hairstyles and clothes to imitate South Korean celebrities. There are reports that North Korean millennials are trying out Western courtship practices like dating, after watching TV shows and movies from South Korea and the United States, violating conservative Confucian codes of conduct between the sexes.Another 24-year-old defector from Musan told me that fashions in popular South Korean dramas \u2014 jewel-lined hair bands, cropped jackets, trendy jeans and even kits for hair perms \u2014 had become available in market stalls in her city. Girls dig through boxes in the market to find the most stylish scarves or sneaker wedges to look like actresses from Seoul.The United States and other nations should sponsor information campaigns to sustain pressure for change within North Korea, with more funding and training for defector-led organizations that create radio and video programs for distribution inside the country. Partnering with companies to create innovative methods of information dissemination \u2014 like satellite phones and low-cost drones \u2014 and investing in defectors with journalism skills will further increase the quality and quantity of information being sent into the North.After a diet of propaganda from the Pyongyang government, North Koreans can find truthful information from abroad confusing, even shocking. But eventually, he said, \u201cyour mind opens up without you even realizing it.\u201dJieun Baek is the author of \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s Hidden Revolution: How the Information Underground Is Transforming a Closed Society.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Foundation, Backed by a Luxury Titan, Focuses on Craftsmanship", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cOur society today honors all the wrong people. Those who do good now live on the last pages of the newspaper. Then there are these footballers making millions. Fashion designers who just stand on the end of a catwalk after a show. Or women who sit on a front row and are paid to wear ridiculous clothes. It really makes us shudder, the level some people will go to for attention. I\u2019m sorry, it is so banal. Where are our values?\u201dJohann Rupert, 66-year-old South African billionaire, chairman and controlling shareholder of the luxury goods group Richemont, owner of brands such as Cartier, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels, was in full rant behind a gleaming mahogany meeting table in his London Mayfair office last month. But instead of just talking about his issues, he is actually doing something about them.In October, quietly and without much fanfare, he co-founded the Michelangelo Foundation. A Geneva-based nonprofit organization, it aims to champion master craftsmanship (initially focusing on Europe) by building networks of like-minded artisans and their supporting institutions, facilitating apprenticeships and nurturing global recognition for the Continent\u2019s applied arts culture, hoping to bolster its future.Franco Cologni, an Italian author and former Richemont business executive, is the other founder; so far, the foundation has a full-time staff of four.\u201cOver the last 15 years, I\u2019ve repeatedly had discussions on what had been happening to the cultural heritage of Europe, but it had got to a point where we basically realized we had to start this right now or let it go completely,\u201d Mr. Rupert said as he puffed on a cigar. \u201cAnd with it, the decline and disappearance of a generational handover of precious skills and disciplines. I simply wasn\u2019t about to let that happen.\u201cIt will be fun, that\u2019s for sure. But boy, it\u2019s also going to take a hell of a lot of time, and a lot of patience to boot.\u201dMr. Rupert has something a little different in mind, however. His focus is not art but artisanship, not the already famous, but the little known. One key objective of the Michelangelo Foundation is to build a digital platform that would showcase all the applied artistry that Europe has to offer; exactly what form that might take is still being decided.In five years, Mr. Rupert said, the site might have a TripAdvisor-style recommendation system, where people could leave comments and critiques on a database, as well as verification of history and provenance related to a specific business.Mr.Cologni, 82, a close friend of Mr. Rupert\u2019s whose work on Fondazione Cologni provided much of the inspiration for the new foundation, added via email that other proposals included underwriting collaborations between designers and artisans; developing a title and recognition at the national level for master craftsmen; and creating an apprenticeship program.\u201cLook, we\u2019ve been very lucky and made more money than we ever thought possible out of luxury goods. But uncovering the raw or enduring talent \u2014 for me, that\u2019s the best part,\u201d Mr. Rupert said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not fun anymore is going to Bond Street or Fifth Avenue or Via Montenapoleone where the shops and product all look the same and have done now for the last 30 years because all the smaller, independent artisans have been pushed out by the retail rentals. We have to protect their livelihoods.\u201d\u201cThis will not be a moneymaking thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be an open platform, a place where people can explore unique products in the one area where Europe is still better than America or Asia.\u201dThere will be no direct relationship between the Michelangelo Foundation and Richemont or any of its portfolio brands. Mr. Rupert said an effort such as this one is made because it is \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d not to sell products. \u201cI hate that corporate and social responsibility stuff \u2014 people telling me how happy I must be because I\u2019m green,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we are going green. You can\u2019t destroy the environment anymore; otherwise, that will eventually destroy you.\u201d\u201cIn order for our foundation to be seen as neutral, it has got to be truly neutral,\u201d Mr. Rupert stressed, noting that to reassure business rivals that they could place products on Yoox and Net-a-Porter, he deliberately has never visited the head office of the luxury e-commerce site in which Richemont controls 50 percent of shares. \u201cArtists need to know that whoever they worked for in the past, or even who they work for now, that they can still come to us and get a fair shot.\u201dWith a nickname of \u201cRupert the Bear\u201d because of his predictions before the 2008 financial collapse, Mr. Rupert emphasizes that the most important issue for the luxury industry and global economy is the unemployment that will be caused by the expanded use of robots, artificial intelligence and the new machine age. Millions of jobs will be lost, he believes, while social inequalities on which the luxury industry thrives will be reinforced.\u201cThere is rising unemployment across the Western world, and it is going to take a generation to re-skill people. Capitalizing on the discontent that has arisen from that is a large part of the Donald\u2019s success,\u201d he said not long before Donald J. Trump won the American presidential election.Mr. Rupert warned of the deep unrest that could stem from a gulf between the haves and have-nots \u2014 a disconnect that many of his brands already heed.\u201cLuxury has got to be more discreet; the day of bling is gone; forget it. The hatred of the rich is going to expand, and people will not want to show their wealth off and put it in people\u2019s faces, like they have in the past. Designers need to start understanding that,\u201d Mr. Rupert said, adding that he told his watch houses five years ago to steer clear of \u201cgreat big hamburger watches\u201d and instead \u201cgo slim, white gold and platinum.\u201dYet despite its chairman\u2019s design directives, sales for Richemont have slowed as of late, as the entire watch and jewelry industry has continued to grapple with China\u2019s recent crackdown on \u201cgifting\u201d between officials, exchange rate volatility, the impact of terror attacks on European tourism and sluggish economic growth. But Mr. Rupert remained upbeat about the sector\u2019s prospects, as long as it nurtured its roots in local craftsmanship.\u201cUltimately, luxury is not something made by a machine in a repetitive fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs a human element \u2014 that is what makes it unique and different. That will always pique curiosity. And we need to protect that talent at its source, while teaching customers that it is always worth paying 20 percent more for something that will last three times as long.\u201cThe problem is most either don\u2019t have the time or just can\u2019t be bothered to walk the back streets and find the individuality. We have to show them exactly where to go.\u201dMr. Rupert spoke passionately about his favorite personal finds over the years in Europe, such as an Irish linen mill, a ceramic shop in Palermo, a Milanese bookbinder and a family-owned Ferrari body work restoration shop in Modena. He attributed what he called a widening disconnect between the shopping habits of the global wealthy and those of earlier generations to the expedited rate at which wealth could be made in the 21st century, an era where many luxury shoppers began to track currencies before determining where they should buy.The Michelangelo Foundation, he said, would go some way to preserving an important thread of social fabric on the Continent: respect for exceptional workmanship that embodies culture and place, and preserving and protecting the boundless creativity of human beings in a rapidly changing world.\u201cUltimately, nobody who hates the successful can really complain about an artisan who does really well,\u201d Mr. Rupert said. \u201cGenuine products made by genuine people in a little town somewhere that really understands beauty and its own history: That is and always will be something special, and I know I have to do all that I can to protect that.\u201cI feel honor bound to do all that I can for this foundation, and start something that we can finish properly, too.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a headline with this article referred incorrectly to a backer of the Michelangelo Foundation. It is Johann Rupert, chairman of the luxury group Richemont, not the company itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save the Pacific Bluefin Tuna", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBluefin tuna are powerful ocean predators, growing up to twice the size of a lion and faster than a gazelle. There\u2019s just one fatal flaw in their torpedo-like design: Their flesh is delicious to humans and worth a lot of money, creating a market demand that has led to a history of rampant overfishing.In the case of Pacific bluefin, weak international regulations have failed to stem the toll. Now, where every 100 fish once thrived, fewer than three remain. Without rapid, coordinated action by the major fishing nations, Pacific bluefin tuna face commercial extinction, becoming too rare to catch profitably. A meeting of those countries and other concerned parties starting Dec. 5 in Fiji may prove critical to stemming the decline.Humans are deeply connected to the global ocean, which covers more than two-thirds of the planet. Disruptions to the marine environment, from collapsing food webs to ocean acidification, can pose threats to our own survival. The severe overfishing of this apex predator critical to the marine food web not only poses an immediate challenge to international fisheries managers but also raises some larger questions for all of us: How do we live within our means and feed a growing population? How can we live in harmony with the rest of life on earth? And how will our descendants inherit an environment that can sustain them?The marine ecosystem is critical to life as we know it. It provides seafood to billions of people and economic sustenance to coastal communities worldwide, while absorbing about half of the human-produced carbon dioxide that is warming our planet to dangerous levels. Pacific bluefin tuna play a vital part in this web of life as they make epic journeys from their birthplace in the waters around Japan to the coasts of California and Mexico, where they spend several years feeding before returning.These fish have a combined yearly market value of close to $1 billion, so commercial fishing interests pursue them relentlessly, and the species can\u2019t reproduce fast enough to sustain itself. The population has plummeted to just 2.6 percent of its historic size \u2014 dangerously low by any measure, and made worse by the threat of climate change.Still, there\u2019s hope. In 2007, a related species, the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, was in serious decline. Fishing quotas exceeded what the best science dictated, and poor enforcement of the quotas resulted in an actual catch that was double the allowed level under the already inflated limits. The crisis led to widespread calls for action.In sharp contrast to their Pacific counterparts, Atlantic fishing nations stepped up to honor their international commitments. They slashed quotas, prioritized national reporting of the catch, and implemented a tracking system to trace the fish from boat to market. Those steps dramatically improved compliance as well as enforcement against illegal fishing. Bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic are now on course toward recovery.In the Pacific, where the situation is far worse, key fishing nations have yet to shoulder their responsibilities and have been unwilling to take the bold action necessary to protect and rebuild this sentinel species because of shortsighted national interests.We must work together to protect our ocean ecosystem, which supports communities, economies and cultures around the Pacific Rim. Nations need to make good on their international commitments to put long-term ocean health ahead of short-term national interest. The Pacific bluefin tuna depends on it.Jane Lubchenco is a marine ecologist at Oregon State University and the former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

{"Headline": "Stalin\u2019s Lengthening Shadow", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 In 1987, at the height of Mikhail S. Gorbachev\u2019s glasnost, I sat down in a Moscow theater with a few hundred others to watch a just-released somber film. Shot three years earlier by the Georgian director Tengiz Abuladze but immediately shelved, the film, \u201cRepentance,\u201d was a powerful allegorical critique of Stalinism in which a corpse refuses to stay buried. In the audience there was not a single dry eye. Finally the monstrosity of Joseph Stalin\u2019s terror could be openly discussed. Sitting in the dark, I realized how painful those secrets, kept so long by millions of Soviet families, had been.Two years later, in June 1989, Communism collapsed in Poland by way of a negotiated \u201csemi-democratic\u201d election. In November the Berlin Wall fell. Another two years and the Soviet Union broke up, on Dec. 26, 1991.Those who witnessed it believed the magic formula of liberal democracy and free-market economy had won, forever. There would be no turning back.Twenty-five years after that, visiting Russia in October, I found Stalin again on the agenda. This time, though, Russian officials exhibited not the paranoid leader of the Great Terror, responsible for millions of deaths, but the glorious war hero whose summer dacha in Sochi is now open for group tours. The first item of our talks, organized by the Valdai Discussion Club, was \u201cWhat if the U.S.S.R. had not ceased to exist?\u201d Obviously, in the minds of very serious people, turning back had become an option. The West\u2019s moment of triumph was short-lived.Of course, we will not see the failed U.S.S.R. reborn. But the political evolution of the last few years, culminating now across Europe and the United States in an explosion of electoral insurrections \u2014 the \u201crevolt of the masses,\u201d President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called it in October \u2014 betrays one simple truth: The democracy-cum-free-market formula has not just lost its magic; it is now openly contested.Nowhere has this formula been more spectacularly challenged than in Poland, where it started. The Poles never accepted Communist domination after World War II. Decade after decade, they tried all sorts of rebellions, soft or hard. Thirty-five years ago, on Dec. 13, 1981, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law and jailed thousands of Solidarity activists in order, he said, to avoid Soviet intervention. Even that failed. Solidarity survived underground and brought the general, his government and the Soviet Union to their knees, forming the first democratic government in the East bloc in 1989.December is a fateful month in Poland, and in freezing temperatures, Poles have taken to the streets again. Some are the very people who were jailed under martial law; they, too, thought their ideas had won forever. Karol Modzelewski, one of the leading intellectuals instrumental in Solidarity\u2019s victory against Communism, joked that a foreign friend visiting Poland after a 30-year interval marveled at how much the country had changed, then noted: \u201cThe only thing which has not changed is the opposition. They are still the same people.\u201dOn Dec. 13, two rival demonstrations were held in Warsaw: one led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of the ruling party, Law and Justice, and one organized by a coalition of opposition parties. A former Solidarity activist himself, Mr. Kaczynski is a reclusive politician whose twin brother, Lech, then president of Poland, was killed in 2010 when the government plane carrying him, his wife and dozens of senior officials crashed in the forest of Smolensk, in Russia. Determined to prove the crash was plotted by Russia, Jaroslaw Kaczynski is obsessed with the past. A member of Parliament, he holds no government post but is widely considered Poland\u2019s real leader.In little over a year, Mr. Kaczynski and his party\u2019s government have engineered much more than parties generally do when they win elections and emerge from opposition. They are trying to build an alternate system to the one established by their former friends in Solidarity after the democratic transition of 1989. At a business conference in Poland in September, Mr. Kaczynski and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary vowed to wage a \u201ccultural counterrevolution\u201d to radically change a post-Brexit European Union.In Poland, it started with an assault on the Constitutional Tribunal: The new government overturned a pre-election appointment of three new judges. The court has been paralyzed since, and with its president\u2019s term having ended on Dec. 19, it now comes under the ruling party\u2019s control. Next came a takeover of public media. Polish national television now broadcasts so much propaganda that people who remember Communist television just sighed when, a few weeks ago, a broadcast of the Oscar-winning movie \u201cIda\u201d was canceled as \u201cun-Polish.\u201d On Dec. 16, privately run television called demonstrations to Parliament against restrictions on media access a \u201cprotest for media freedom\u201d; public TV denounced them as an \u201cattempt to destabilize the state.\u201dIn less than a year, thousands of officials suspected of sympathy with the opposition have been dismissed. Textbooks are being rewritten. Nongovernmental organizations and public gatherings are being regulated. Leaders of the democratic transition, once treated as national heroes, are being investigated for collaboration with the former Communist government; not even Lech Walesa, the former president and Nobel peace laureate, has been spared. Their biggest \u201ccrime\u201d is to have decided not to initiate a witch hunt against their former oppressors.For Mr. Kaczynski, 27 years later, revenge is the order of the day. He does not travel abroad, or speak foreign languages, nor does he meet foreign journalists; only rarely does he meet foreign leaders. Yet on Dec. 15 he spent two hours talking with the former New York mayor and close Donald J. Trump associate Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was on a business visit to Poland. The only foreign leader he sees regularly is Mr. Orban. Interestingly, Poland and Hungary, where in 1989 the most liberal elites in the region led the transition to democracy from totalitarianism, now lead the pack of \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d within the European Union.What happened? Why, less than 30 years after crying over Stalin\u2019s crimes, do 86 percent of Russian citizens approve of a leader who glorifies the Soviet Union\u2019s legacy? \u201cSoon it will be 120 percent,\u201d Mr. Gorbachev recently joked in a BBC interview; he blames the West and its media. Mr. Kaczynski blames the arrogant elites of his country and the European Union.Because of Poland\u2019s history, Mr. Kaczynski is at odds with Russia. Yet his political style resembles Mr. Putin\u2019s. The authoritarian streak, excused by nationalism. The accusations of \u201canti-state\u201d activities against the opposition. The constant references to conservative cultural values \u2014 Roman Catholic in Poland, Orthodox in Russia \u2014 and enrollment of religious leaders in the political fight. The difficulty in accepting pluralism. The appetite to control the media and civil society.Just as the West wonders how to deal with Mr. Putin, the European Union seems powerless with Poland\u2019s and Hungary\u2019s leaders; such assaults on our values by member states had hardly been envisaged. Now that Mr. Trump is giving a whole new dimension to the turn toward what is called populism, maybe this is a good time to reflect on the quarter-century triumph of liberal democracy, and how to win it back.Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taiwan Feels Forgotten. But Not by Trump.", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The atmosphere here is almost jubilant. The phone call last weekend from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan to President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2014 the first contact between a Taiwanese president and an American president or president-elect since at least 1979 \u2014 has received rare bipartisan support here on this self-governing island off southern China. It was, many agree, a great thing for the country.Still, in an interview on Tuesday, her first since the call, Ms. Tsai said that the implications of the direct contact with Mr. Trump were limited. \u201cI have to stress that one phone call does not mean a policy shift,\u201d she told me and a small group of other American journalists who traveled here on a reporting trip organized by the East-West Center, a Hawaii-based nonprofit organization. \u201cI do not foresee major policy shifts in the near future because we all see the value of stability in the region.\u201dBut Ms. Tsai\u2019s statement is unlikely to dampen the excitement. For the first time in years, this island of 23 million is making headlines around the world. That\u2019s cause for celebration in a country that usually feels abandoned and ignored \u2014 even if it remains unclear how United States policy toward China will really change under Mr. Trump.\u201cIn Taiwan, we have this feeling that we are being forgotten by the world,\u201d said Szu-chien Hsu, a political scientist and president of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. \u201cWe are this vibrant democracy, but people always forget about us.\u201dAs China has grown in wealth and stature, Beijing has steadily chipped away at Taiwan\u2019s standing in the world. Taiwan\u2019s economy is the fifth largest in Asia and the 22nd largest in the world. Yet the island is shut out of membership in international organizations like the United Nations, and can\u2019t even accept Olympic medals under its own flag or preferred name.Even so, Taiwan has developed its own democratic traditions right under China\u2019s nose. Taiwanese are fiercely proud of their democracy. Many here crave recognition for this accomplishment. In our interview, Ms. Tsai alluded to the kinship that Taiwanese felt with liberal democracies like the United States as one reason for the contact with Mr. Trump. \u201cThe phone call was a way for us to express our respect for the U.S. election,\u201d she said.The United States maintains a careful balancing act in its relations with Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory, though the island has governed itself since 1949. China demands that other countries adhere to a \u201cone China\u201d policy, having diplomatic relations with Beijing or Taipei, but not both. A vast majority of the world, of course, chooses Beijing.The foreign policy establishment\u2019s dismay over the call to Mr. Trump plays into the idea that the United States-China relationship is fragile and must be painstakingly nurtured to prevent international crisis. But this may be a fallacy. Relations between the two countries have remained largely stable since official diplomatic relations began in 1979, and even the Tiananmen Square uprising and the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, when the United States sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area in response to provocative missile tests by China, did no lasting damage.While United States-Taiwan relations remain informal but strong, some Taiwanese are frustrated with Washington\u2019s apparent fixation on pleasing China. \u201cThe people who quickly condemn this in the U.S., they do so either to kowtow to China or to attack Trump,\u201d Kwang-yin Liu, a reporter at CommonWealth Magazine in Taipei, told me. \u201cFew really care about what values Taiwan stands for.\u201dMs. Tsai\u2019s call to Mr. Trump carries a risk for Taiwan, whose economy is closely intertwined with China\u2019s. China has already expressed its displeasure with Ms. Tsai\u2019s less Beijing-friendly administration by restricting mainland tourism to the island. Beijing\u2019s reaction to Ms. Tsai\u2019s conversation with Mr. Trump so far has been relatively mild, but it could easily retaliate for the phone call, further limiting tourist permits, or even poaching Taiwan\u2019s few remaining allies, for example, by offering trade deals in exchange for recognizing China instead of Taiwan.The latest country to switch its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to the People\u2019s Republic was the tiny African nation of Gambia in March. Further diplomatic losses would be a heavy blow to Taiwan. One senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told me, \u201cWe do not want to play this up to confront China.\u201dIt is, by contrast, far more difficult for China to retaliate against the United States without harming itself in the process. Such retaliation could include China\u2019s reluctance to sign on to American foreign policy priorities, like sanctions on Iran or efforts to halt North Korea\u2019s missile program \u2014 important, to be sure, but hardly existential threats to the United States.Even though the repercussions it faces are far greater, Taiwan seems less afraid of standing up to the Goliath next door than its more powerful North American friend. Despite facing a sober future, Taiwanese will continue to celebrate what they see as an overdue recognition of their hard-won existence. The United States seems fainthearted by comparison.Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian is on leave from Foreign Policy magazine, where she is an assistant editor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Sees New Ambiguity With Donald Trump\u2019s Taiwan Call", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s leaders have been markedly reticent about what kind of leader they think Donald J. Trump will be. A pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? Or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft?\u201cThis is a wake-up call for Beijing \u2014 we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the China-U.S. relationship,\u201d Wang Dong, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University, said Saturday. \u201cThere was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about Trump. That should stop.\u201dChinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with Washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump to appear in the state-run news media. Many of those accounts have depicted the president-elect as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person China might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war.In the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as Mr. Trump begins his administration, Beijing will probably take a wait-and-see attitude despite his phone call with Ms. Tsai, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University.Indeed, China\u2019s first official reaction, from Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was fairly benign \u2014 though it was firm in reiterating the One China policy, under which the United States formally recognized Beijing as China\u2019s sole government in 1978 and broke ties with Taiwan a year later. No American president or president-elect had spoken to a Taiwanese president since then.Mr. Wang blamed Ms. Tsai\u2019s government for arranging the call. \u201cIt won\u2019t stand a chance to change the One China policy agreed upon by the international community,\u201d he said.A follow-up statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the United States government, was similar in tone. It urged \u201crelevant parties in the U.S.\u201d to \u201cdeal with the Taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner.\u201dMr. Trump broke a Chinese taboo merely by using Ms. Tsai\u2019s title. The Chinese state news media refer to the Taiwanese president as the \u201cleader of the Taiwan region,\u201d to indicate that Beijing regards Taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as Chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control.President-elect Donald J. Trump has broken with decades of diplomatic practice in freewheeling calls with foreign leaders.A basic tenet of the Chinese government is that Taiwan, where Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s forces fled in 1949 after losing China\u2019s civil war, will be brought back into the fold. According to Mr. Xi, Taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his so-called China Dream, a vision of an economically successful Communist China astride the world.Though Beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of long-established practice. Since the mid-1990s, Washington has signaled to Taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from China.The Obama administration\u2019s last arms sale to Taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest \u2014 consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1.8 billion in total \u2014 but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from Beijing.Douglas H. Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents American interests there, said it would not be surprising if the United States sold arms to Taiwan early in the Trump administration. Beijing\u2019s reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed China of the sale, Mr. Paal said.While it broke diplomatic precedent, Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of Republican presidents\u2019 reaching out to Taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office.George W. Bush, for example, was vocal in his support of Taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the United States would do \u201cwhatever it took\u201d to defend it. His aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the One China policy. By the end of his second term, Mr. Bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between Beijing and Washington through the approval of China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization.Though Mr. Trump has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some Chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer China opportunities to show strength.Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the China-United States relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. He said China, with its growing military and the second-largest economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. \u201cChina is increasingly resilient to the United States,\u201d he said.Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, took a contrarian view of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Ms. Tsai: He said it was not a problem because Mr. Trump had yet to take office. \u201cHe is a private citizen,\u201d he said.But if such contacts continue after Inauguration Day, Mr. Shen said, China should end diplomatic relations with the United States.\u201cI would close our embassy in Washington and withdraw our diplomats,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. I don\u2019t know how you are then going to expect China to cooperate on Iran and North Korea and climate change. You are going to ask Taiwan for that?\u201dAn article on Dec. 4 about China\u2019s likely re-evaluation of President-elect Donald J. Trump after his telephone call to Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, referred incompletely to the presidential candidacy of Hung Hsui-chu of the Kuomintang party. Favored by China, she initially challenged Ms. Tsai, but later dropped out of the race.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s John Williams Feels Uncertainty Among Business Leaders", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said his meetings with business leaders in recent weeks had been dominated by uncertainty about the economic plans of President-elect Donald J. Trump.Trade with China and immigration from Mexico have been huge drivers of economic growth in the western United States. Excitement about tax cuts and regulatory relief has been tempered by worries about the impact of less trade and less immigration.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Williams described what he has been hearing. He also talked about the postelection shift in his own economic outlook, and what he has learned about the health of the American economy over the last 12 months.His comments have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.Republicans are talking about tax cuts that could provide a jolt of fiscal stimulus. Did that play a role in the decision to raise rates in December?I\u2019m going to give you my own views on that. The unemployment rate has fallen to well below 5 percent, core inflation has been edging up over the last year or so, and other signs of good momentum, such as job growth, made a very convincing case to make this small step at this time. While there are a lot of tensions around fiscal policy and those developments, in my view this decision stands on its own. From my perspective, my support for the rate increase was based wholly on the data we have seen and the basic economic outlook over the next couple of years.But surely the pace of future rate hikes will depend in part on fiscal policy?The thing about conducting monetary policy in this time, it\u2019s really important to reiterate that we\u2019re focused on our maximum employment and price stability goals. There are decisions that are made by the elected representatives in Congress and the administration, and that\u2019s the process that should happen. What we need to do and what we will do is focus on any changes in the economic outlook, what does that mean for achieving our goals and for the right path of policy decisions to achieve those goals. I know everyone likes to talk about fiscal policy in terms of what does it mean for the outlook. In the last couple of years we\u2019ve also had some big shocks to the economy that came from across the globe. There\u2019s a lot of things that can change and we have to stay focused on our goals and continue to be data dependent in terms of analyzing what do these changes mean for our outlook.The Fed\u2019s baseline for next year is three rate increases. Is that your view?I will say that my underlying view for next year is broadly consistent with the central tendency of the committee. My view is that the economy is going to grow roughly as it did this year, unemployment is going to edge down a little bit, inflation moving back to 2 percent, and that calls for gradual removal of policy accommodation.So Mr. Trump\u2019s election hasn\u2019t had a big impact on your economic outlook?Obviously I don\u2019t have any particular insights into what the new Congress or the new administration is going to do around fiscal policy. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about what policies are going to be enacted, and that matters a lot in terms of thinking about any effects on the economy. I do think, even though I\u2019m definitely \u201cwait and see\u201d in terms of learning what happens, the main effect on my outlook is that my view on the risks to the outlook have shifted a little. Those risks used to be maybe balanced and if anything a little bit to the soft side because of global developments and other factors that might cause growth to weaken. And I think that the possibility of greater fiscal stimulus and other changes in policies would if anything move those risks a little bit to the right. But it\u2019s not a big effect.If the economy is now growing at something close to its sustainable potential, what good can come of fiscal stimulus?Changes in fiscal or other policies that can increase potential output of the economy or the growth rate of the economy in terms of the supply side obviously would be beneficial in terms of the low equilibrium interest rate. The kind of things I\u2019m thinking about are policies that lead to increased investment, whether it\u2019s public investment in infrastructure or productivity: enhancing business investment around research and development or just general expansion of investment in plants and facilities and things like that. We\u2019re trying to have a game changer around longer-term growth prospects and boost the long-run strength of the economy. And it\u2019s really going to have to come through things that either increase the productivity of the economy or on the other side improve and increase the labor force and give education or job training, improving the productivity of our work force. Those are the things that really matter for the long run.Is there any value in deficit spending just to stimulate growth?Any discussion around federal fiscal policy has to \u2014 at this juncture, given that the economy is near full employment and it\u2019s in pretty good shape in terms of the business cycle \u2014 it should be focused on improving the longer-run performance of the economy. I think that\u2019s beneficial to everybody in our society. The other issue that\u2019s obviously important is that you want to have a federal budget that\u2019s sustainable in the long run. So when thinking about fiscal policies, I would really think the key issue is, \u201cWhat are policies that would improve the long-run performance of our economy and make our economy stronger in the longer run and put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path?\u201d So hopefully that\u2019s the direction that things will go.I think the important thing to remember on this is that this is not an issue about the U.S. or Canada. It\u2019s an issue that according to our research and an increasing number of researchers, this observation that the equilibrium interest rate appears to be at very low level and is likely to stay that way for a long time is more of a global phenomenon. The one piece of advice I give on this is: Stop thinking about this as a national issue. It\u2019s really a global phenomenon driven by demographic trends and what economists call the global savings glut or heightened demand for safe assets. I think people around the world are starting to focus on this. The question of what\u2019s the right remedy, that\u2019s kind of the later discussion.If it\u2019s a global issue, does it require a coordinated response?If people came to the conclusion that given the equilibrium real rate [inflation targets should be increased], I do think there would be advantages: that the more countries that raised their target at the same time, I think the greater the benefit is. If you look at some of the research that\u2019s going on, I think one of the most interesting and important conclusions from that is that the negative spillovers from other parts of the world, if they go into recession and hit the zero lower bound, and monetary policy cannot be fully effective in bringing their economies back to full strength, the negative spillover is greater if the rest of the world is also getting pushed down to the zero lower bound. When everybody is at the zero lower bound and they\u2019re all being constrained, there\u2019s a negative feedback loop. Weakness abroad spills over to the United States and then we can\u2019t offset that as effectively. If we had a higher inflation target and didn\u2019t come to the zero lower bound, we\u2019d be free to adjust our policy to offset any effects coming from abroad, and that has a positive influence on the global economy. And with a very low inflation target around the world, the likelihood of all of us hitting the zero lower bound is higher. And if everyone had a higher inflation target \u2014 a modestly higher target, a 3 or 4 percent target \u2014 then the likelihood of all us getting to the zero lower bound at the same time is much lower. My punch line is: Yes, countries can do it one by one. That would work. We\u2019ve seen it happen. But I do think there are some benefits to a more, I wouldn\u2019t say coordinated, but perhaps a more correlated approach.You mentioned the Bank of Canada\u2019s accounting every five years. There are proposals before Congress to increase the Fed\u2019s accountability. Do you think there are versions of that idea that would be desirable?To my mind the most important feature of what the Federal Reserve operates under is the ability to act independently of short-term political influence. To me that\u2019s the bedrock of any discussion of reforms around the Federal Reserve. Research has shown that independent central banks can work more effectively at keeping inflation low and stable and keeping economies performing up to their potential, and that\u2019s a critical piece of any Fed reform. It\u2019s essential that we retain the ability to make what can be politically unpopular decisions in the interest of the economy. That\u2019s the way the Federal Reserve was constructed, and various reforms have maintained and strengthened that so we can focus on our dual mandate goals.The other point I\u2019d make that doesn\u2019t get enough attention is that these efforts to tie the Fed\u2019s hands seems to be completely at odds with the structure of the Federal Reserve in having a committee of presidents from around the U.S. together with governors, having a group of people with different perspectives and backgrounds and different understandings of how monetary policy works. That whole structure is designed to get away from groupthink and it\u2019s designed to show that we don\u2019t all agree and highlight different views.But are there steps you think the Fed should take?Obviously I believe strongly in transparency at the Federal Reserve in terms of our strategy or our policies. We\u2019ve moved dramatically toward more transparency in the 20 years I\u2019ve been at the Fed. I think those are all positive things and I\u2019m a supporter of any efforts we can do to be more transparent around our thinking around policy decisions within that rubric of being independent of short-term political pressure.Our monetary policy report [sent to Congress twice a year] as currently constituted doesn\u2019t really provide this kind of information \u2013 the analysis around monetary policy \u2013 the stuff that you see around monetary policy reports at the Bank of England or the Riksbank. You look at those other reports and you\u2019re saying, these are quite amazing documents in terms of how much content they put into those. Our report, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near best practice in terms of having that kind of report. That\u2019s a big undertaking and a lot of work, but that\u2019s again what I look at \u2013 is there a way even with our structure to come up with a monetary policy report that would give that depth to the analysis. We hide from the public how much work and thought goes into these, how much assessment of risks to the outlook in policy decisions, how much thinking goes into that.Have you been surprised by the strength of job growth? Was there more room for the economy to improve than you expected?Labor force participation has held up a little better than we had thought. And we\u2019ve got a lot more research on this, in the context of \u201cHey, maybe we were missing something.\u201d One approach is to say, let\u2019s just treat everybody in the population as potentially in the labor force. Everyone over 16, let\u2019s look at that whole pool and construct a nonemployment index and for each group \u2014 a person in school, a person who\u2019s in retirement \u2014 you ask statistically, what\u2019s the percentage of those people who get a job in the next month? The punch line is when you look at this broader statistic, that number is basically consistent with an unemployment rate below 5 percent and it\u2019s very similar to the figure you get in 2005, when the economy was at full employment. What that tells me is whatever has been happening over the last year, where we are today is essentially consistent with being at full employment.That does leave the huge question: If we really are at trend, why is participation so much lower than it was 10 years ago? And that\u2019s something economists have really turned their energy to understand: Why today the normal is so much different?Trade with China, and immigration from Mexico, have been huge drivers of economic growth in your district. Are you concerned about the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to limit both?We\u2019ve been collecting a lot of perspectives from business leaders and community leaders in our district. And it was fascinating to me. It was one of the most interesting conversations I\u2019ve had. First of all, everybody who came to these meetings, that\u2019s what they were thinking about. Obviously there are people very excited about perhaps a little more business-friendly regulation. A lot of people are excited about lower corporate taxes. But it was striking because in that same conversation where people said I\u2019m bullish on this or cautiously optimistic on that, it was striking how much concern business leaders in my district expressed around immigration and trade. Obviously trade is a big deal here on the West Coast. Our industries are very export-oriented. That was an area where there is uncertainty around where that would go, not as a political statement, just \u201cHow would this affect us?\u201d given how many industries and jobs are really tied to a global economy.In terms of the agriculture industry, which is still a big part of the Western economy, clearly issues around labor availability came up quite a bit. That\u2019s tied to immigration, but it\u2019s also tied to concerns about our education system and making sure that if we\u2019re going to restrict the availability of labor into our market one way or the other, we\u2019re going to need to train and prepare our work force for the jobs that we need to fill.Similarly you heard comments in tech about H1B visas. Nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen but this is a region of the economy that really has been built over a very long period of time around global trade, around openness, around bringing in the best talent from around the world into the technology world, superlative universities that attract people who come here and end up staying here. What I heard a lot of was more about the uncertainty of this, and people saying in the end this either means more mechanization if we don\u2019t have labor available, to have this done even more by machines.And then in the tech world and quite honestly entertainment too we know that this is a very fungible industry. If it\u2019s hard to get the labor to come here, you\u2019ll have to have your offices, your research-and-development shops and other things where the labor can be. There\u2019s always a discussion around Canada being very open to having tech centers open up where they do research and do other things. It\u2019s not a political thing. It\u2019s more about the uncertainty.Advertisement"}

No, the causes lie elsewhere.Rarely do Americans vote in the same party for a third term, and yet this was a two-note campaign based on Mr. Obama\u2019s coattails and the Trump bogy, without inspiration, vision or change.Malefactors clearly took their toll: the Russians, Breitbart, the fake news apparatus, the F.B.I. and more.The wave of white middle-class anger was in many cases a euphemism for racist backlash.

{"Headline": "Now, America, You Know How Chileans Felt", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byOp-ed ContributorDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 It is familiar, the outrage and alarm that many Americans are feeling at reports that Russia, according to a secret intelligence assessment, interfered in the United States election to help Donald J. Trump become president.I have been through this before, overwhelmed by a similar outrage and alarm.To be specific: On the morning of Oct. 22, 1970, in what was then my home in Santiago de Chile, my wife, Ang\u00e9lica, and I listened to a news flash on the radio. Gen. Ren\u00e9 Schneider, the head of Chile\u2019s armed forces, had been shot by a commando on a street of the capital. He was not expected to survive.Six weeks earlier, Salvador Allende, a democratic Socialist, had won the presidency in a free and fair election, in spite of the United States\u2019 spending millions of dollars on psychological warfare and misinformation to prevent his victory (we\u2019d call it \u201cfake news\u201d today). Allende had campaigned on a program of social and economic justice, and we knew that the government of President Richard M. Nixon, allied with Chile\u2019s oligarchs, would do everything it could to stop Allende\u2019s nonviolent revolution from gaining power.The country was rife with rumors of a possible coup. It had happened in Guatemala and Iran, in Indonesia and Brazil, where leaders opposed to United States interests had been ousted; now it was Chile\u2019s turn. That was why General Schneider was assassinated. Because, having sworn loyalty to the Constitution, he stubbornly stood in the way of those destabilization plans.Given all that pain, one might presume that some glee on my part would be justified at the sight of Americans squirming in indignation at the spectacle of their democracy subjected to foreign interference \u2014 as Chile\u2019s democracy, among many others\u2019, was by America. And yes, it is ironic that the C.I.A. \u2014 the very agency that gave not a whit for the independence of other nations \u2014 is now crying foul because its tactics have been imitated by a powerful international rival.I can savor the irony, but I feel no glee. This is not only because, as an American citizen myself now, I am once again a victim of this sort of nefarious meddling. My dismay goes deeper than that personal sense of vulnerability. This is a collective disaster: Those who vote in the United States should not have to suffer what those of us who voted in Chile had to go through. Nothing warrants that citizens anywhere should have their destiny manipulated by forces outside the land they inhabit.The seriousness of this violation of the people\u2019s will must not be flippantly underestimated or disparaged.This country deserves, as all countries do \u2014 including Russia, of course \u2014 the possibility of choosing its leaders without someone in a remote room abroad determining the outcome of that election. This principle of peaceful coexistence and respect is the bedrock of freedom and self-determination, a principle that, yet again, has been compromised \u2014 this time, with the United States as its victim.What to do, then, to restore faith in the democratic process?First, there should be an independent, transparent and thorough public investigation so that any collusion between American citizens and foreigners bent on mischief can be exposed and punished, no matter how powerful these operatives may be. The president-elect should be demanding such an inquiry, rather than mocking its grounds. The legitimacy of his rule, already damaged by his significant loss of the popular vote, depends on it.But there is another mission, a loftier one, that the American people, not politicians or intelligence agents, must carry out. The implications of this deplorable affair should lead to an incessant and unforgiving meditation on our shared country, its values, its beliefs, its history.The United States cannot in good faith decry what has been done to its decent citizens until it is ready to face what it did so often to the equally decent citizens of other nations. And it must firmly resolve never to engage in such imperious activities again.If ever there was a time for America to look at itself in the mirror, if ever there was a time of reckoning and accountability, it is now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Plans Technology Conference With Silicon Valley Executives", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump plans a technology conference next week with high-profile business executives, many of whom opposed his campaign.\u25a0 The chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent company says many of those jobs at that plant in Indiana will now be lost to automation.\u25a0 Vice President-elect Mike Pence says the national security adviser-designate\u2019s son has nothing to do with the transition, and it appears he no longer does.\u25a0 Mr. Trump, who flies in his own private jet, appears to have ordered the cancellation of the next generation of Air Force One \u2014 via Twitter.President-elect Trump is planning to convene a technology conference next week, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The tech industry was almost universally opposed to Mr. Trump, which might give the meeting a touch of combativeness. His transition team and cabinet posts draw much more heavily from Wall Street than Silicon Valley.There is one major exception: Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump backer who is now in New York helping with the transition. Late last week, David Sacks, the chief executive of Zenefits, said he was stepping down amid conflicting reports that he will be working on the transition as well. Mr. Sacks is a longtime associate of Mr. Thiel.The list of those being invited was not immediately clear, but among those expected are Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google.The president-elect\u2019s move to save 1,100 jobs at a Carrier furnace plant in Indiana has been a political winner, even if it has raised concerns among economists on the left and the right.Now the chief executive of United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent company, says in the end, many of those jobs (he put the figure at 800) likely will fall to automation rather than Mexico.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make up $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we\u2019ll make the capital investments there.\u201dMR. CRAMER: \u201cRight.\u201dMR. HAYES: \u201cBut what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.\u201dHe also confirmed that he feared standing up to the president-elect could be very costly to his conglomerate, which includes a lot of defense work.\u201cThere was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open. At the same time \u2014 and I\u2019ll tell you this because you and I \u2014 we know each other, but I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.\u201dThe president-elect has now taken shots at two American companies by name, Carrier and Boeing, which he suggested on Tuesday \u201cis doing a little bit of a number\u201d with the cost of an Air Force One redesign.That latter hit came after Boeing\u2019s chief executive told The Chicago Tribune he is leery of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies.How is business responding? Very cautiously.In a Business Roundtable conference call Tuesday to release its latest survey of how its members see the economy, Douglas R. Oberhelman, chairman of the business group and the chief executive of Caterpillar, did not criticize the president-elect\u2019s threats to punish companies if they move production abroad.\u201cI think it\u2019s a great dialogue,\u201d he said.Mr. Oberhelman did push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on American manufacturers that export products made overseas back into the United States.\u201cIf he thinks we can negotiate better, then we ought to,\u201d he said. \u201cI do worry about retaliation with a 35 percent tariff or a unilateral action against a trading partner, especially if it\u2019s a big one like China.\u201dVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program, said on Tuesday that the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who posted a baseless fake news story on Twitter on Sunday night, has \u201cno involvement in the transition whatsoever.\u201d And indeed, Mike Flynn Jr. may have been pushed out.The younger Mr. Flynn has sat in on some transition meetings and lists it as part of his biography. Until Monday, he had a transition email and has served as General Flynn\u2019s chief of staff.But on Tuesday, emails to that transition address were bouncing back, and transition spokesman Jason Miller said on a morning conference call that the general\u2019s son is no longer involved.But the senior Flynn has put out conspiracy theories and fake news stories of his own on Twitter:Mr. Pence will speak Tuesday night at a Heritage Foundation event at, where else, the Trump International Hotel in Washington. No word yet what Heritage is paying the Trump Organization for the space.The Morning Consult poll, of course, showed the usual partisan divide. Only 37 percent of Trump voters said the president-elect was going a little heavy on the tweets, while 79 percent of Hillary Clinton voters thought so.Then again, there were considerably more voters for Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump.Regardless, he\u2019s tweeting anyway:It\u2019s war.\u201cElected leaders, they have to be gracious to Trump. That\u2019s not our role,\u201d said David Brock, the driving force behind several pro-Hillary Clinton efforts during the presidential election and the founder of American Bridge.Why American Bridge\u2019s advisers believe that what did not work during the election will suddenly succeed once Mr. Trump becomes president is unclear. During a conference call announcing its plans, an adviser went through the considerable resources the group can bring to bear like tens of thousands of hours of footage of Mr. Trump, an army of researchers digging into his background, a powerful media megaphone.American Bridge and other like-minded groups had all that during the campaign, of course. Asked what difference it all made, Mr. Brock pointed to the small comforts he could take in what was a devastating and unexpected loss: Mr. Trump\u2019s historically low approval ratings, the high share of voters who say a Trump presidency frightens them, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s success with low-income voters.And he added one more. \u201cWe did win the popular vote,\u201d Mr. Brock noted.By a lot \u2014 2,653,958 votes and still rising.Mr. Brock did not mention \u2014 nor was he asked \u2014 whether abolishing the Electoral College would be on American Bridge\u2019s agenda.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said Tuesday that it was \u201cprudent\u201d for President-elect Trump to accept a call from the leader of Taiwan, a move that has been sharply criticized as an affront to China.\u201cI think for him to not take a congratulatory call would in and of itself be considered a snub,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters.Mr. Ryan, who added that he had recently spoken to the Taiwanese president himself during a layover at a Miami airport, declined to comment on the appropriateness of Mr. Trump\u2019s subsequent Twitter posts about the call.\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to sit here and comment on the daily tweets?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not going to do that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we may have had some influence,\u201d Mr. Dole, the former Kansas senator and Republican presidential nominee, said.Christopher Suprun, a Republican elector from Texas, announced in The New York Times on Monday that he would not cast his vote for Mr. Trump when the Electoral College convenes \u2014 and a group of academics and lawyers are trying to coax more \u201cfaithless\u201d electors to follow suit.The United States was set up as a republic. Alexander Hamilton provided a blueprint for states\u2019 votes. Federalist 68 argued that an Electoral College should determine if candidates are qualified, not engaged in demagogy, and independent from foreign influence. Mr. Trump shows us again and again that he does not meet these standards. Given his own public statements, it isn\u2019t clear how the Electoral College can ignore these issues, and so it should reject him.To give encouragement, and legal support, the Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig and the law firm Durie Tangri have teamed up to start what they are calling the Electors Trust, offering free counsel to other electors pondering Mr. Suprun\u2019s route.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a CNBC commentator.

{"Headline": "A Dilemma for Humanity: Stark Inequality or Total War", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs there nothing to be done about galloping inequality?The point is not that President Obama should have done better. He probably did the best he could under the circumstances. The point is that delivering deep and lasting reductions in inequality may be impossible absent catastrophic events beyond anything any of us would wish for.History \u2014 from Ancient Rome through the Gilded Age; from the Russian Revolution to the Great Compression of incomes across the West in the middle of the 20th century \u2014 suggests that reversing the trend toward greater concentrations of income, in the United States and across the world, might be, in fact, nearly impossible.Professor Scheidel does not offer a grand unified theory of inequality. But scouring through the historical record, he detects a pattern: From the Stone Age to the present, ever since humankind produced a surplus to hoard, economic development has almost always led to greater inequality. There is one big thing with the power to stop this dynamic, but it\u2019s not pretty: violence.The big equalizing moments in history may not have always have the same cause, he writes, \u201cbut they shared one common root: massive and violent disruptions of the established order.\u201dThe collapse of the Roman Empire in the second half of the fifth century, reinforced by a bubonic plague pandemic, brought about Western Europe\u2019s first great leveling. Productivity collapsed and the aristocracy\u2019s far-flung assets were expropriated, while Rome\u2019s trade networks and fiscal structures were destroyed.Inequality bounced back, of course. By 1300 the richest 5 percent of people had amassed nearly half the wealth in the cities of Italy\u2019s Piedmont. But another bubonic plague known in history as the Black Death changed all that, killing a quarter of Europe\u2019s population in the 14th century and cutting the share of wealth of Piedmont\u2019s rich to under 35 percent.Mr. Scheidel\u2019s depressing view is bound to upset liberal politicians and social scientists, who quite naturally might prefer to live in a world in which events might move political and social systems to figure out a more equitable way to distribute the fruits of growth without the plague, the guillotine or state collapse.The standard understanding of inequality\u2019s dynamics, at least until recently, was tamer. Posited in the 1950s by the Russian-born American economist Simon Kuznets, it held that disparities would grow in early stages of industrialization, as the successful few took advantage of new opportunities, but stabilize and decline as things like mass education, rising wages and social insurance naturally \u2014 and peacefully \u2014 raised incomes at the bottom.\u201cIt makes a lot of sense as far as it goes,\u201d he said of Professor Scheidel\u2019s thesis, \u201cbut do I believe this is the entire story about how inequality can decline? No.\u201dPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal as a huge public effort to restore employment and raise incomes and spending in response to the Depression of the 1930s, not war, Professor Gordon points out.\u201cIt takes a big shock to create the right political situation, but it is the underlying politics that change things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Great Depression created a political opportunity, like the assassination of President Kennedy created a big political moment for Lyndon Johnson.\u201dThe sense of social cohesion and sacrifice inspired by the war also underpinned an egalitarian social ethos that supported higher taxes and discouraged titanic profits and pay for chief executives. Between 1939 and 1945 the income share of the richest 10 percent dropped by more than 10 percentage points. And it did not start inching back up until the 1980s.But whatever was holding large-scale inequality in check, it is now spent.Dream on. As Professor Scheidel bluntly puts it: \u201cSerious consideration of the means required to mobilize political majorities for implementing any of this advocacy is conspicuous by its absence.\u201dSo what does this leave us with? Another world war, with or without thermonuclear weapons? Let\u2019s hope not. State collapse looks highly unlikely outside of some bits of sub-Saharan Africa. Revolution? Little chance, given the absence of any powerful ideological challenge to capitalism.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Gets an Opening from Russia, but the Path Is Risky", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has pledged to reset relations with Russia, may have been tossed a lifeline by President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday. The Russian leader, skilled at keeping several steps ahead of his adversaries, announced that he would not retaliate against the Obama administration for imposing new sanctions and expelling Russian diplomats from the United States.That clears the way for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin to declare that they are starting anew \u2014 just what both men have publicly called for.By Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to embrace Mr. Putin.Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!For effect, Mr. Trump \u201cpinned\u201d the post to the top of his Twitter feed, ensuring that it will remain the first message seen on his page. In a rapid demonstration of digital glasnost, within minutes the Russian Embassy in Washington had retweeted it.\u201cPutin is going out of his way to not take Obama seriously,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, who spent decades in the C.I.A. tracking Russia while Mr. Putin was rising in the K.G.B. Instead, he said, \u201che is making a good-will gesture, presumably with the hope and expectation that Donald Trump will respond in kind.\u201dNow the question is whether the mutual admiration pact opens new chapters in a range of areas in which the longtime adversaries are at odds, including Syria, Ukraine, Crimea, the Middle East, the future of NATO and the development of nuclear weapons.But moving too far, or too fast, in Moscow\u2019s direction creates enormous risks for Mr. Trump. From Capitol Hill to Europe, people are already worried that Mr. Trump will simply do Mr. Putin\u2019s bidding.Certainly no one is more suspicious of Mr. Putin and his long-range intentions to undermine the West, and American leadership, than the Republican Party establishment. Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the few left in the Senate who fought on the front lines of the Cold War, plans to hold the first hearing, on Thursday, on Russia\u2019s effort to manipulate the election.And, like the Obama White House, many of those Republicans see Mr. Putin\u2019s gesture \u2014 including inviting the children of American diplomats to enjoy the Christmas trees at the Kremlin \u2014 as a ploy.There is little chance the Republican inquiries can be derailed. So while Republicans in Congress are investigating, Mr. Trump plans to be investing in a new relationship.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.In recent days, he has told associates he sees little upside to what he considers needless fights with Russia, and he has long said he sees potential in maintaining a working relationship with Mr. Putin. Mr. Trump has often said there are benefits to cooperating with Russia in fighting the Islamic State in Syria, even though Russia has directed little of its firepower against the terrorist group.Later on Friday, Mr. Trump praised Fox News, apparently for its coverage of Russia.Now the question is whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin can work a trade: a relaxation of tensions in return for an easing of the sanctions that have helped cripple the Russian economy since the United States and its allies imposed them.Syria could be the first area of cooperation. For months, Mr. Trump has talked about working hand in glove with Moscow against the Islamic State and other jihadist groups. That seemed a fanciful notion while Russia was painting all of the Syrian opposition with the same brush and bombing the moderate Syrian opposition more than the Islamic State. But if a shaky cease-fire agreement announced on Thursday holds, it could focus Russian military action for the first time exclusively on the Islamic State and the Islamist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the Nusra Front.\u201cThe agreement potentially sets the table for Trump in Syria,\u201d said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.Still, Mr. Tabler and other Syria specialists said the opportunity came with a number of important caveats. First, the cease-fire needs to hold so that a more enduring political solution to the Syria crisis can be pursued. That will require restraint on the part of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian opposition, the Iranians and the Russians.Second, unless a political settlement is achieved that eventually eases Mr. Assad out of power, Syria may continue to be a magnet for extremists and insurgency, perpetuating the very problem that Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump say they are trying to solve.While the Obama administration was not included in the cease-fire discussions, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, extended a hand to Mr. Trump, who has never objected to Moscow\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East.\u201cI would like to express my hope that after the administration of Donald Trump assumes its duties, it will also join the efforts in order to channel this work into one direction basing on friendly and collective cooperation,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said during a meeting Thursday with Mr. Putin.A Trump administration could become involved in future diplomatic talks, from which Secretary of State John Kerry was excluded in recent months. It could \u201ccoordinate\u201d with the Russians militarily, something Mr. Obama\u2019s defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, has resisted.Syria is just the beginning. The fragile Baltic members of NATO \u2014 Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania \u2014 are looking at large military buildups meant to intimidate them. The Ukrainians have seen their lights turn off mysteriously and tracked it to Russian hackers. The British and French report that Russian practice bomber runs and submarine missions just off their shores, something they have not seen since Soviet days.The French and the Germans say they already see signs of hacking and \u201cinfluence operations\u201d in their own elections, scheduled for next year. Each has political movements with echoes of the one that brought Mr. Trump to power and that could eat away at the European Union and the NATO alliance.The most difficult problem may be what to do about the oldest form of post-World War II competition: nuclear weapons.Emerging from his briefings, Mr. Trump has expressed surprise in recent weeks about the size and abilities of Russia\u2019s arsenal and has largely blamed New START, the arms control treaty that Mr. Obama negotiated.It is not clear if Mr. Trump has been briefed on the \u201cnuclear modernization\u201d program on which the Obama administration and Congress have spent billions, or seen the Pentagon\u2019s proposals for the $1 trillion revamp of the delivery systems \u2014 submarines, missiles and bombers \u2014 to make them stealthier and more survivable. If he signs on, that race could become serious, and seriously expensive.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month that Donald J. Trump seemed to back away from sanctions in an interview with The New York Times. The interview was in March, not November.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from West Palm Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carson Is New Sign Trump Plans to Govern From the Right", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump is moving to repudiate vast parts of President Obama\u2019s domestic agenda as he fills his cabinet with conservatives who have long records opposing the current administration on social programs, wages, public lands, veterans and the environment.Mr. Trump\u2019s selections to lead the Departments of Education, Commerce, Justice, and Health and Human Services, and the names under consideration for other federal agencies with broad authority over the lives of Americans, have cheered Republicans in Washington, who have spent eight years battling Mr. Obama\u2019s administration.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that elections have consequences,\u201d said Thomas M. Davis, a former congressman from Virginia, who said he was impressed by the ideological philosophy of Mr. Trump\u2019s domestic agency appointments. \u201cRepublican philosophy says markets can do a better job. It\u2019s a huge clash with Obama.\u201dPresident-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.If he is confirmed, Mr. Carson will embrace a starkly different approach to those problems, compared with housing secretaries during Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure. He opposes government programs that he says encourage \u201cdependency,\u201d and he has been fiercely critical of housing programs intended to end segregation.Mr. Carson joins a growing cast of nominees who, if confirmed, will assume control of hundreds of thousands of federal employees as they seek to shift policies developed during nearly a decade of Democratic governance.Aside from his focus on immigration and the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump spent little time on the campaign trail detailing a specific policy agenda. But many of his nominees have spent their careers advocating positions that will now become the focus of examination during their confirmation hearings. Taken together, they suggest an administration determined to alter course on immigration, abortion, housing laws, the environment, worker protections and privatization of federal functions.\u201cWe will learn a lot more during the hearings,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cCertainly, I think it\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve seen in the last eight years.\u201dOn the domestic front, announcements of several cabinet posts are helping to define the new president\u2019s approach to issues at home. His choices so far suggest a more conservative approach to many domestic issues than Mr. Trump himself articulated during the campaign.This week, Mr. Trump is expected to fill a series of positions that will accelerate the U-turn from current policies.He is said to be seriously considering Mary Fallin, Oklahoma\u2019s Republican governor, for interior secretary, which would presage a shift away from the department\u2019s current approach toward energy and public lands. Mr. Obama has aggressively sought to shut down fossil fuel production and increase the use of renewable sources of energy, while Ms. Fallin is an outspoken proponent of drilling and fracking on public lands. She was the first governor to announce she would oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed rules on emissions from coal-fired power plants.And former Senator Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican, may get the nod to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Brown, who met with the president-elect last month about taking the job, might reverse the current administration\u2019s opposition to privatizing parts of the department.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to outsource some of those cases to private vendors, obviously,\u201d Mr. Brown told reporters at Trump Tower after his meeting. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work with the Department of Defense so when that soon-to-be-veteran actually leaves the D.O.D., we know what his or her needs are. There\u2019s a breakdown there.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition said Monday that several cabinet announcements and White House staffing decisions were \u201clikely\u201d this week, following the president-elect\u2019s recent picks to oversee the Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Commerce Departments.Last month, Mr. Trump announced that he had chosen Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. Ms. DeVos, a longtime Republican fund-raiser, has spent nearly 30 years pushing for families to receive public funds to send their children to private and parochial schools, usually to the consternation of teacher unions.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.She is certain to challenge the approach that Mr. Obama and his administration have followed, often with the support of those same unions. After being chosen by Mr. Trump, she wrote on her Facebook page, \u201cThe status quo in ed is not acceptable.\u201dAnd Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to be the next attorney general, has long been a fierce advocate of a crackdown on immigrants who are in the country illegally. He was one of the most vocal opponents of an immigration overhaul, calling it amnesty. And in speeches from the floor of the Senate, he railed against Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions aimed at protecting some immigrants from deportation.These choices have put Democrats and liberal activists on notice that the agenda in Washington is changing, Mr. Davis, the former congressman, said. \u201cThis is clearly not going to be pleasing to them,\u201d he said.In a statement last week, Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said as much, reflecting on Mr. Trump\u2019s nominations with dismay and predicting, or perhaps hoping, that Americans would reject the direction of his government as too extreme.\u201cDonald Trump the candidate claimed he would rein in the power of Wall Street traders, protect Social Security and Medicare, and ensure all kids have great schools,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cBut his cabinet choices send a dangerous signal about how President-elect Trump will conduct his presidency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You\u2019ve read a few books on investing and gleaned the basics \u2014 the importance of diversification, of investing for the long term, and of buying and holding rather than trying to beat the market. But you also know that human-caused climate change will (if it hasn\u2019t already) start eroding economic output. Extreme weather, droughts and crop failures could mean mass migration and political instability. As Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, recently put it, the \u201cgreenhouse-gas crisis\u201d won\u2019t burst like the housing bubble of 2008 because \u201cclimate change is more subtle and cruel.\u201dWhat\u2019s a climate-aware investor to do?Individuals aren\u2019t the only ones contemplating this question. Sixty-nine percent of Fortune 500 companies reported more demand for \u201clow carbon\u201d products this year, according to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project. And some of the country\u2019s largest pension funds, including the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System and New York State\u2019s retirement fund, have begun tilting away from fossil fuels.This approach has been called \u201csocially responsible investing.\u201d But these days, money managers aren\u2019t doing it only because they think it\u2019s morally correct; they also worry that, over the long term, fossil fuels are a losing bet.Some experts told me that the historic accord on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions reached in Paris last year was a turning point in how investors think about climate change. The United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest emitters, ratified it in September. It\u2019s now unclear what will happen to the agreement; President-elect Donald J. Trump has said he wants to pull the United States out of it.But it\u2019s worth noting that business interests \u2014 and Mr. Trump sells himself as a consummate businessman \u2014 were integral to making the Paris deal happen in the first place. They realize that \u201cenvironmental stability is absolutely at the base of financial stability,\u201d Christiana Figueres, the diplomat who organized the conference, told me. Extreme weather, like the 2011 monsoon floods that ravaged parts of South Asia where electronic components that go into hard disks and cars are built, have driven that lesson home.Something more hopeful is happening as well. Renewable energy prices have dropped, and are nearly competitive with fossil fuels. China aims to build enough charging stations to power five million electric cars by 2020. What will happen, Ms. Figueres asked, if China phases out the combustion engine altogether? \u201cYou can begin to see the signals,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tide is beginning to change.\u201dAdvances in battery technology are part of this change. The wind doesn\u2019t blow all the time, nor does the sun shine all day. Energy produced intermittently needs to be stored. A lack of easy storage options has been an obstacle to renewables. But battery costs have declined by more than 70 percent since 2008. Mark Fulton, a founding partner of Energy Transition Advisors, says that what\u2019s about to happen with the battery and renewables is an old-fashioned technological disruption story, akin to the advent of the internet. From an investor\u2019s standpoint, this kind of disruption could mean losing your shirt or, if you plan properly, handsome returns.One of the myths around socially responsible investing is that aligning investments with ethics means lower returns. But that\u2019s not the case. George Serafeim, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, and his colleagues analyzed data going back over 20 years. Companies that were committed to sustainability outperformed companies that weren\u2019t, they found. A dollar invested in sustainability-minded companies in 1993 would have grown to $22.58 by 2014, but just $15.35 if invested in companies with no such commitments. Why might this emphasis increase profits? These firms may also be more likely to invest in human capital and be better run overall.But even if you divest, says Jean Rogers, chief executive of the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, there\u2019s no escaping the ripple effects of climate change. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so ubiquitous, it\u2019s very hard to diversify away from climate risk,\u201d she told me.Another approach is a kind of divestment lite. Asha Mehta, director of responsible investing at Acadian Asset Management, told me that her clients increasingly request a \u201cdecarbonization\u201d of their portfolios. Worried that complete divestment might hobble a portfolio\u2019s performance, however, Ms. Mehta might reduce a portfolio\u2019s carbon footprint to, say, 80 percent of a benchmark like the S.&P. 500 by removing the biggest emitters. A firm called Osmosis Investment Management takes a different tack. It researches the overall efficiency of companies \u2014 how many resources a firm uses to create how much product. And instead of excluding certain industries entirely, Osmosis chooses only the most efficient within a given sector. It caters to institutional investors, but plans to release a fund for individuals soon.You can, of course, try to do what Osmosis does on your own; the Carbon Disclosure Project has a trove of information on how companies fare on the sustainability front. But here\u2019s the problem. More than 5,600 corporations disclose sustainability information, but no standards govern these disclosures. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and others are working to devise such standards. Pressure is also mounting on the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the disclosure of sustainability information. The commission recently asked for feedback on reforming the disclosure process, and a good chunk of letters mentioned sustainability and climate change.Under a Trump administration, it seems less likely that the S.E.C. will respond to these concerns. But that may have a paradoxical effect: If investors can\u2019t count on regulators to enforce transparency on sustainability, says Sonia Kowal, the president of Zevin Asset Management, they may take matters into their own hands.So if you\u2019re concerned about how climate issues might damage your nest egg, you might begin by raising your voice. Ask your fund managers about their plans. And look at how the funds you own vote on sustainability-related issues, such as whether to calculate and disclose a company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, or whether to develop a risk-assessment plan for climate change.Does that make you an activist? \u201cThe word I prefer is \u2018investor advocate,\u2019 \u201d Jackie Cook, who operates Fund Votes, told me. \u201cYou\u2019re advocating for your own investments.\u201dFor many, the perceived gap between socially responsible investing and good business has narrowed almost to the point of convergence. And maybe that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. A Citi report from last year put the costs of climate change, without mitigation, at $44 trillion by 2060. Many analysts have pointed out that a yearslong drought preceded the conflict in Syria \u2014 an example of how shifting climate can encourage political instability that ripples around the world. And this year, a report from the World Economic Forum said that the No. 1 global risk in the next 10 years was water crises. Nos. 2 and 3 were climate adaptation failure and extreme weather.The economy can be only as healthy as the planet that houses it. Pushing for transparency on sustainability issues, and asking money managers to consider climate change, is really the purest form of self-interest.Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Disease,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bruised Investor Seeks Justice for China\u2019s Market Turmoil", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileSHANGHAIWITH the nausea came a sense of frustration. Earlier this year, Xu Caiyuan watched helplessly as the numbers flashed across a computer screen in his office in Shanghai\u2019s glittering financial district.\u201cDuring the stock market plunge, many middle-class investors lost their money, and they don\u2019t know why,\u201d Mr. Xu, 38, said over lunch in a Southeast Asian restaurant overlooking a park in Shanghai\u2019s French Concession. \u201cThe reason the market plummeted is because this is a man-made disaster.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a human factor behind the stock market crash,\u201d he added. \u201cThe crash took me by surprise. I thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t normal.\u2019\u201dIn person, Mr. Xu does not look like a legal brawler. A slim, short man, he showed up to lunch wearing hip glasses and a navy suit with white dots. But as he pulled out documents related to his lawsuit and spoke about them in sharp bursts, his combative side became evident.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there will be justice, but I can choose to do things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason we appealed to the courts is we trust in the courts and the legal system.\u201dMr. Xu had already achieved some prominence in financial circles as an activist investor, known for bringing lawsuits against companies he had invested in that he thought had failed to act in the best interests of shareholders.His attempt to sue the C.S.R.C. after the January 2016 crash was different, because he was taking on the government. A lower court and a high court rejected the lawsuit this year, despite the news media coverage. In October, he filed an appeal with the Supreme People\u2019s Court, hoping the judges would force a lower court to hear the case.He has been traveling between Shanghai and Beijing all year to deal with the courts, and now awaits an answer.Zhang Ren, a lawyer at the Beijing Century Law Firm who has been advising Mr. Xu, said the government\u2019s attempts to ignore Mr. Xu\u2019s lawsuit \u201care embarrassing.\u201d\u201cAnd the Intermediate Court\u2019s negligence is embarrassing, too,\u201d he added, referring to a lower court in Beijing that rejected Mr. Xu\u2019s lawsuit.Mr. Zhang said the case was one that could be a legal marker. \u201cWhen China becomes more democratic and respects the rule of law, this could be a precedent,\u201d he said.Another lawyer, Liang Min, disagreed, saying Mr. Xu was pushing a \u201csensationalistic\u201d case with no basis in proper administrative law.Mr. Xu comes from Wenzhou, in Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, known as a hotbed of entrepreneurship. The youngest of three children, Mr. Xu attended Huadong Normal University in Shanghai, where he studied management. He said he began investing in stocks in 1998, even before he had graduated.\u201cAt the time, I would look through the financial reports and annual reports of listed companies and make decisions,\u201d he said.AFTER graduation, he worked several years as a university administrator, then became a full-time investor and eventually started a company to manage investment funds. He now has a small office in the Lujiazui neighborhood, the center of Shanghai\u2019s financial industry.He manages two private equity funds, both named after him: Caiyuan No. 1 and Caiyuan No. 2. He belongs to a Wenzhou business association in Shanghai \u2014 it is common for Wenzhou entrepreneurs to band together in cities where they live \u2014 and to an investors\u2019 group in Lujiazui.Mr. Xu said that the funds weathered the market crashes and that his lawsuit was tied solely to his personal investments. He declined to say how much money he lost in the market turmoil, but said some friends had lost the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars.Mr. Xu became a public figure in 2008, when he led a shareholder suit against Gangfan, a state-owned steel company based in Sichuan Province that was undergoing restructuring, accusing it of wrongly failing to buy back stock warrants held by investors. A local court ruled in favor of the shareholders. The central government agency in charge of state-owned enterprises then ordered Gangfan to pay the investors 7 billion renminbi, or more than $1 billion.The victory made news. Since then, Mr. Xu has brought a half-dozen similar lawsuits. In 2010, he was named a \u201cWenzhou Economic Figure\u201d by Wenzhou Economic Newspaper for his efforts to protect shareholders\u2019 rights.\u201cSome of the listed companies, when they see me, they avoid me like the plague,\u201d he said. \u201cA regulatory body, for example the C.S.R.C., it has headaches.\u201dNot all of the lawsuits have been successful. He failed in an attempt to sue a pharmaceuticals company in Inner Mongolia with large property holdings \u2014 \u201cThis company was set to be a big enterprise in Inner Mongolia, so I think it had influence,\u201d he said.Police officers in Inner Mongolia called Mr. Xu to question him over the telephone. Officers in Shanghai did the same.Through the years, Mr. Xu has continued investing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an opportunist,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always invested based on the value of the companies.\u201dThe case Mr. Xu is trying to make against the China Securities Regulatory Commission is not an easy one. Mr. Xu said he believed the market crashed in part because state-owned enterprises sold large holdings and withdrew from the market under cover from the agency, which reassured people that big investors were staying in the market.He also said the C.S.R.C. had issued a statement called Document No. 21, in which its head, Mr. Xiao, said that a large state securities company would keep up its investments to stabilize the market. That turned out not to be true, Mr. Xu said \u2014 in reality, the company and other state-owned enterprises sold off stocks.The C.S.R.C. spokesman did not respond to multiple calls made to his office on Friday seeking comment.Mr. Xu also tried to file a second lawsuit against the agency, this one accusing the agency of not disclosing information properly. The First Intermediate Court accepted the case in September, but then last month reversed itself. Mr. Xu said he was also appealing that decision.\u201cI think Wenzhou people are very persistent,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cThey can endure hardship. They don\u2019t surrender to failure.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect dollar equivalency for the 7 billion renminbi that Gangfan was ordered to pay investors. It equals more than $1 billion, not $100 million.Kiki Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foes of Russia Say Child Pornography Is Planted to Ruin Them", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 His indomitable will steeled by a dozen years in the Soviet gulag, decades of sparring with the K.G.B. and a bout of near fatal heart disease, Vladimir K. Bukovsky, a tireless opponent of Soviet leaders and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is not a man easily put off his stride.But he got knocked sideways when British police officers banged on the front door of his home on a sedate suburban street here early one morning while he lay sick in bed and informed him that they had \u201creceived information about forbidden images\u201d in his possession.\u201cIt was all very bizarre and disturbing,\u201d Mr. Bukovsky said. \u201cThis is not normally the language of a free society,\u201d he added, recalling how his old K.G.B. tormentors used to hound him and his friends over texts and photographs declared forbidden by the Soviet authorities.The images sought by the British police, however, had nothing to do with politics but involved child pornography, a shocking offense in any jurisdiction. The officers hauled away a clunky desktop computer from Mr. Bukovsky\u2019s study \u2014 a chaos of books and papers dusted with cigarette ash \u2014 and a broken computer from his garage.In April last year, the veteran Soviet dissident, a onetime confidant of Margaret Thatcher, finally found out what was going on: The Crown Prosecution Service announced that he faced five charges of making indecent images of children, five charges of possession of indecent images of children and one charge of possession of a prohibited image.The case was supposed to go to court in May in Cambridge but, after Mr. Bukovsky, 73, entered a not-guilty plea it was delayed until Dec. 12. This followed a prosecution request for more time to review an independent forensic report on what had been found on Mr. Bukovsky\u2019s computers and how an unidentified third party had probably put it there.\u201cThe whole affair is Kafkaesque,\u201d Mr. Bukovsky said in an interview. \u201cYou not only have to prove you are not guilty but that you are innocent.\u201d He insisted that he was the victim of a new and particularly noxious form of an old K.G.B. dirty trick known as kompromat, the fabrication and planting of compromising or illegal material.Old-style kompromat featured doctored photographs, planted drugs, grainy videos of liaisons with prostitutes hired by the K.G.B., and a wide range of other primitive entrapment techniques.Hacking is not only a good way to get real information, like the emails of the D.N.C., but a relatively easy and usually untraceable way to plant fake information. For example, when unidentified hackers last year broke into the computers of a government research center in Lithuania, they stole nothing, but planted bogus reports on its website that the country\u2019s stoutly pro-American president had worked as an escort and K.G.B. informer while a student in Leningrad during the Soviet era.A similar break-in affecting the Lithuanian military\u2019s website replaced a bland announcement about a coming NATO exercise with a fake statement that presented the exercise as part of a plan to annex Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, and join it with Lithuania, a member of NATO.The supposed NATO plan outlined in the phony text closely mimicked methods used by Moscow in 2014 to annex Crimea and stir up unrest in eastern Ukraine, including the seizure of military posts and police stations and calls for the establishment of the Kaliningrad People\u2019s Republic.Written in faulty Lithuanian, the statement was \u201cimmediately obvious as a fake,\u201d said Rimtautas Cerniauskas, the director of Lithuania\u2019s National Cyber Security Center, which was set up last year in response to increased alarm over Russian aggression.But, he added, the stunt nonetheless succeeded in distracting cyberdefense staff members from their normal work for days and in spreading a lie that, though immediately exposed, polluted discussion about NATO.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in aliens, but if you see enough articles about aliens visiting Earth, you start to think \u2018Who knows, maybe the government is hiding something,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cerniauskas said.Seemingly, no target is too small to warrant attention, no attack too petty. Trained to believe that the ends always justify the means, Russian security service operatives \u201chave sick minds,\u201d Mr. Bukovsky said. \u201cThey live in a virtual reality.\u201dThis blurring of all boundaries between truth and falsehood in the service of operational needs has created a climate in Russia in which even the most serious and grotesque accusations, like those involving pedophilia, are simply a currency for settling scores. Mr. Bukovsky is far from the only one fending off such allegations.Yoann Barbereau, the French director of the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, has been struggling since early last year to defend himself against charges that he posted child pornography on a website for Russian mothers. His lawyers, pointing to evidence that his computer was tampered with after his arrest, believe that the material was planted by local security service officers to punish Mr. Barbereau for an extramarital romance with a woman connected to a powerful local official. In September, after months under house arrest, Mr. Barbereau fled.Konstantin Rubakhin, an environmental activist who lives in exile in Lithuania, also got a visit from police officers looking for child pornography. Mr. Rubakhin speculated that that raid, in June last year, may have been part of an effort to derail his application for political asylum or his work for the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum, a research group that investigates corruption. In the end, the Lithuanian police dropped the case.Russia has denied any involvement in all of these incidents. \u201cOf course they do,\u201d scoffed Linas Linkevicius, Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cThey never have anything to do with anything that is going on in the world,\u201d he said, describing Russian hackers, whether working directly for the state or as freelance vandals, \u201cas part of their weapons system.\u201d\u201cThey have very efficient hybrid warfare means,\u201d he added.In the case of Mr. Bukovsky and the others involving pornography stored \u2014 or planted \u2014 on the computers of Kremlin critics, the high degree of deniability offered by the shadows of cyberspace has left the accused struggling to salvage their reputations.\u201cTo use a technical term, you are completely screwed,\u201d said Jeffrey Carr, the head of Taia Global, an American cybersecurity company, and the author of a book on cyberwarfare. \u201cIf something like this is sponsored by the Russian government, or any government or anyone with sufficient skill, you are not going to be successful. It is terrible.\u201dRussia first flexed its cybermuscle publicly in 2007 with a blitzkrieg attack across a broad front in Estonia, a Baltic nation often at odds with Moscow. The computer systems there of the police, military, banks, media and government offices faced a lengthy barrage of superfluous requests designed to crash their networks, a tactic known as a distributed denial-of-service attack.Taimar Peterkop, the director general of Estonia\u2019s Information System Authority, which watches over the core pillars of the country\u2019s highly digitalized economy and government, said that after that early assault the cybermischief linked to Russia has only expanded in both range and sophistication.\u201cNowadays it seems they want to show they are everywhere,\u201d Mr. Peterkop said. \u201cLike flying bombers close to our and other countries\u2019 borders, they perhaps simply want to show they have an important global footprint. It is almost as if they want to be seen, or maybe we are just responding better.\u201dLast year\u2019s assault on Ukraine\u2019s energy system involved far more elaborate tools than those used in the 2007 distributed denial-of-service attacks on Estonia and were the first known successful effort by Russia or its proxies to knock out vital civilian infrastructure with hackers worming their way into control rooms.Robert Lee, the director of Dragos Security, a cybersecurity company in Maryland, who helped investigate the electricity shutdown in Ukraine, said that identifying the culprits would \u201cnever be certain\u201d but that \u201cwhen we look at tradecraft, capabilities and motive of the group involved, we can come to a high-confidence assessment that the group was Russian-based and a medium-confidence assessment that there were members in the government that knew this was going to happen.\u201dThis gray zone of uncertainty has been seized on by Russia as proof that it is the victim of \u201cRussophobic\u201d hysteria over its role in cyberspace. It has also left Mr. Bukovsky \u2014 and others caught in what they believe are Moscow-orchestrated kompromat traps \u2014 at the mercy of Western police and courts that demand hard evidence, not guesswork and accusation from defendants.Inside Russia, kompromat has featured for years in political and business disputes. Under President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 1990s, it was a dirty game played by both the Kremlin and its foes but, under Mr. Putin, compromising videos and other embarrassing material invariably target only the Kremlin\u2019s opponents.Before becoming president at the end of 1999, Mr. Putin played a prominent role in a particularly spectacular example of this Russian specialty. As head of the Federal Security Agency, or F.S.B., in 1997, Mr. Putin won the trust of Mr. Yeltsin by helping to destroy the career of Russia\u2019s prosecutor general, Yury Skuratov, who, after starting an investigation into Kremlin corruption, was disgraced on national television by the broadcast of a video that showed a man who looked like him in bed with two young women.Mr. Putin certified in public that the man in the video, widely believed to have been arranged and then filmed by the F.S.B., was indeed the prosecutor general. Mr. Skuratov resigned. The corruption investigation ended. A grateful Mr. Yeltsin named Mr. Putin prime minister and then president.The idea that Europeans and Russian opponents of the Kremlin are sexual deviants with a taste for pedophilia is a strange but recurring theme in Russian propaganda. The Russian ex-wife of a Norwegian man gained wide attention in state media, for example, with fabricated claims, made after she lost a child custody battle in Norway, that her former husband dressed up their 4-year-old son in a \u201cPutin costume\u201d and raped him.Mr. Bukovsky, who was a close friend of Mr. Litvinenko, said he had strongly urged him not to publish. \u201cI was very angry with him,\u201d Mr. Bukovsky recalled, noting that in many ways Mr. Litvinenko, despite his ferocious hostility toward the Kremlin, still had the mind-set of a security officer and \u201ccould not understand the difference between truth and operational information.\u201dOn the \u201cdark web,\u201d an area of the internet that requires special software and authorization codes to enter, suspected Russian hackers openly offer to plant evidence of pedophilia as a way to destroy an enemy.\u201cI\u2019ll do anything for money,\u201d promised an advertisement placed by a hacker who offered to ruin \u201cyour opponents, business or private persons you don\u2019t like. I can ruin them financially and or get them arrested, whatever you like.\u201d Boasting that it was possible to destroy both individuals and businesses, the hacker added, \u201cIf you want someone to get known as a child porn user, no problem.\u201d He gave a price, denominated in Bitcoins, of around $600 per job.Paulo Shakarian, the chief executive officer of IntelliSpyre and the director of the Cyber-Socio Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Arizona State University, said his team had analyzed the advertisement and concluded that it was probably posted by a Russian (or at least a Russian-speaking) hacker. He said the price was in the normal range of what hackers demand for character assassination.No matter what the court in Britain decides, Mr. Bukovsky has already had his reputation \u2014 and, by association, that of other Kremlin\u2019s critics \u2014 trashed in Russia. Russian state television, in a report on the case, described the dissident as \u201ca lover of child porn.\u201dMr. Bukovsky complained that European countries that expect clarity and follow rigid procedures easily fall prey to the dirty tricks of a regime that excels in hiding its tracks and creating confusion. \u201cThey are very good at using the West against the West,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton Campaign Demands Intelligence on Possible Russian Efforts to Elect Trump", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump is postponing until January his announcement about how he will handle his private business interests.\u25a0 The Clinton campaign breaks its silence and demands declassification of the intelligence on Russian election meddling.\u25a0 Mr. Trump takes to Twitter to deny Russian involvement in his victory.\u25a0 Senator John McCain says there is no doubt about Russian hacking, which he called \u201cwarfare.\u201d\u25a0 Carly Fiorina for director of national intelligence? She certainly took the president-elect\u2019s line on China.For those waiting to see Mr. Trump hold a news conference to discuss the ethical concerns about conflicts with his business, you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer.Transition officials said on Monday evening that they were postponing a news conference scheduled for Thursday at which Mr. Trump had said he would reveal his plans to avoid conflicts of interest with his sprawling real estate business.The president-elect instead will make that announcement in January \u2014 likely before his inauguration and after an extended vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida \u2014 officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News.Officials said the focus on building a cabinet had consumed more of Mr. Trump\u2019s time than expected. And they said that it was taking time to address how to address the large, iconic real estate holdings that are part of the global Trump business.As the swirl of allegations around Russia\u2019s efforts to elect Mr. Trump roils Washington, one voice has been absent: Hillary Clinton\u2019s.John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, broke the silence on her behalf, demanding the declassification of all information about Russia\u2019s meddling as well as an explanation from the Obama administration of what it knew and when it knew it.\u201cWe now know that the C.I.A. has determined Russia\u2019s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. \u201cThis should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d\u201cThis is not a partisan issue, and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia\u2019s role,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe believe that the administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia\u2019s interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia\u2019s roles in the election and to make this data available to the public.\u201dThrown on the defensive, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that the White House did not announce a major probe of Russia\u2019s interference before the election partly because many voters would have seen such an announcement as political meddling.He said Russia did not hack the electoral process or the counting of votes.\u201cBut what is also clear is that the results of the hack and leak effort carried out on the orders of Russia were extensively discussed prior to the election,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.And forensic analysis does allow experts to trace the source of a hack.On that one, he will have bipartisan support \u2014 just not in congressional districts where the fighter is built.Mr. McCain said on Monday that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking\u201d by Russian intelligence services into Democratic campaign accounts, which he called \u201canother form of warfare.\u201dAppearing on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next minority leader, Mr. McCain said the wide-ranging investigation of Russian meddling in the election would include his committee as well as the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees.He said a Senate investigation would be necessary despite President Obama having already ordered up an inquiry, as that one would not be completed before the end of the Obama administration. The implication was that the new Trump administration would not follow through.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to point a finger, and I don\u2019t want this to turn into the Benghazi investigation,\u201d Mr. Schumer added, referring to the House investigation into the attacks on an American compound in Libya, which he said had been partisan. \u201cThis is serious stuff.\u201d\u201cWe intend to discharge our duties as electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who, as our founding fathers envisioned, would be \u2018endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u2019 As electors, we also believe that deliberation is at the heart of democracy itself, not an empty or formalistic task. We do not understand our sole function to be to convene in mid-December, several weeks after Election Day, and summarily cast our votes.\u201dTheir request:\u201cThe Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations. We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as president of the United States.Additionally, the electors will separately require from Donald Trump conclusive evidence that he and his staff and advisers did not accept Russian interference, or otherwise collaborate during the campaign, and conclusive disavowal and repudiation of such collaboration and interference going forward.\u201dMs. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, emerged from a meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Monday to talk tough, not on Russia but on China, which she called \u201cour most important adversary and a rising adversary.\u201dMs. Fiorina was called in to discuss the job of director of national intelligence, a senior transition official said.And Ms. Fiorina, once a bitter foe of Mr. Trump\u2019s, was effusive.\u201cWe talked about hacking, whether it\u2019s Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talked about the opportunity that the president-elect has to literally reset things, to reset the trajectory of this economy, to reset the role of government, to reset America\u2019s role in the world and how we\u2019re perceived in the world. And I think it\u2019s why he\u2019s getting such fantastic people in his administration.\u201dAll appears to be forgiven.\u201cFirst I want to say, he has really cool stuff in his office,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these athletes have given him all this incredible memorabilia. I was particular taken by Shaq O\u2019Neal\u2019s shoe, which is huge. I guess it takes a champion to know a champion.\u201dThree days ago, an image calling for the extermination of Muslims was posted on former Representative Allen West\u2019s Facebook page.The outrage prompted an aide to Mr. West, a former Army lieutenant colonel, to claim credit and take the image down.The outrage wasn\u2019t too great to deny Mr. West another audience with the president-elect on Monday at Trump Tower. Nor was it enough to prompt a question from the reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, though they did ask Mr. West about Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump president.Reporters: Should there be a bipartisan investigation of Russia hacking?Mr. West: \u201cI think there are more important things. We\u2019re about to see a collapse in Syria, Iraq is falling apart. the Iran nuclear deal is horrific. China and Russia are expanding. I think that\u2019s where we need to focus your intelligence efforts.\u201dAfter a campaign full of attacks on Wall Street \u2014 and Goldman Sachs in particular \u2014 Mr. Trump will have Goldman\u2019s No. 2 in the West Wing and a former Goldman partner, Steven Mnuchin, next door at Treasury, if he is confirmed.But the transition team tried to find something inspirational in the latest multimillionaire:\u201cIn addition to his incredible business history, Mr. Cohn has an inspiring personal story. Growing up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, he was diagnosed at age 7 with dyslexia.\u201dThat is one of the rare moments where Shaker Heights, an affluent suburb of Cleveland, is mined for inspirational struggle.Mr. Trump is looking at appointing a rising Republican star from South Dakota, Representative Kristi Noem, as his secretary of agriculture, a senior official working on the transition said Monday.The transition team is vetting Ms. Noem now, and she is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump this week.Ms. Noem, 45, would be one of the younger members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet \u2014 a group that so far consists mostly of older men.She has been planning to leave Congress at the end of her next term in 2018 to run for governor of South Dakota.Another name floated for the agriculture job, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is being considered for a variety of jobs, including energy secretary. Because she is a Democrat \u2014 and would likely be replaced in the Senate by a Republican \u2014 the transition official said she could essentially have \u201cwhatever job she wants.\u201dSpeaking of roles, the former Texas governor, Rick Perry, who wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy but could not remember its name on live television, has emerged as a leading candidate for energy secretary.Although Texas is rich in energy and Mr. Perry is big on extracting it, he cannot afford too many \u201coops moments\u201d if he is named to that post.The Energy Department\u2019s primary role is to design nuclear weapons and ensure the safety and reliability of the nation\u2019s aging nuclear arsenal \u2014 through a constellation of scientific laboratories. The two men who served as President Obama\u2019s energy secretaries were scientists, one with a Nobel Prize, the other from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Mr. Trump is also looking at two other possibilities for energy secretary. He likes Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 for the job. Both are under tremendous pressure from fellow Democrats not to accept a cabinet job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilian Meat Merchant Plans a Less Complicated I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsJBS, the Brazilian meatpacker, sharpened its carve-up blade. On Monday, the $8 billion company filed papers for an initial public offering of its overseas business, trying again after a government shareholder rejected an earlier plan that could have put the unit under control of a foreign parent. The new deal should lower capital costs, but with fewer complications.An international acquisition spree built the company, controlled by billionaire brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, into the world\u2019s biggest meat merchant. Gobbling up the likes of American poultry producer Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, however, loaded JBS with debt.About 80 percent of its sales and most of its $16 billion or so of total borrowings are denominated in dollars. The company\u2019s base is in Brazil, where a gyrating economy and currency mean it pays a higher cost of capital.When JBS unveiled in May a plan to spin off its international operations to shareholders, its stock rose by over one-fifth. That would have created a Dublin-based subsidiary listed in New York. It also could have resulted in the new overseas group eventually assuming total control. The Brazilian Development Bank, known as BNDES, which is a 20 percent owner of JBS, vetoed the plan in a surprise decision that sent shares reeling.Under the new arrangement, which does not require BNDES approval, JBS will retain control of a new Dutch-based international holding company with a New York listing. The I.P.O. proceeds, initially estimated at up to $500 million in the registration filing, will be used to pay down debt. JBS also hopes to transfer bonds to the American-listed entity.After initially failing to win over one Brazilian owner, JBS now has the task of wooing many investors far and wide. Floating 15 percent of the international operations at 6.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, which would be a discount to its rival Tyson Foods, could raise about $1.5 billion. That would reduce net debt at the parent company to around 2.8 times Ebitda by the end of 2017 from over three times, based on Ita\u00fa estimates. Anticipated leverage of three times Ebitda for the new international arm should be manageable. For JBS and potential new shareholders, this may turn out to be the prime cut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chicago, Bodies Pile Up at Intersection of \u2018Depression and Rage\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Over Memorial Day weekend, when The New York Times tracked every shooting in Chicago, the largest concentration of them was in the city\u2019s 11th police district. But why?Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 For hours, the body lay where it had landed, just steps from the wooden sign someone had put up \u2014 a painted gun with a red slash through it.Inside a nearby house, Lee Baez had heard the gunshots in the darkness and got up to move his car so his fianc\u00e9e would not have to walk past the body as she left for work before dawn.Down the block, Sandra Harris rose later to care for her ailing 85-year-old mother and saw the body, by then draped with a sheet.After the authorities finally carried away Lee Martin, the 43-year-old man who was shot in his head and back and died here on Walnut Street in the middle of an August night, another neighbor emerged to scrub the red streaks off the sidewalk.\u201cI just pray that nothing comes through the window and hits Mother,\u201d Ms. Harris, 58, said, glancing over at the spot where Mr. Martin\u2019s body had been a few hours earlier.Living on Chicago\u2019s West Side, where the dazzling downtown skyline always seems to shimmer in view but out of reach, means mornings like these grow strangely normal. The blue lights, the yellow tape, the next day\u2019s quiet moving on \u2014 all of it.The Times returned to the blocks in the 11th District where the Memorial Day weekend shootings occurred to try to better understand Chicago\u2019s crisis of violence.Residents along Walnut Street and at other crime scenes told of a fractured community \u2014 isolated by this city\u2019s entrenched segregation, hollowed out by joblessness and poverty, and battered by resignation and indifference.Here, graystone homes and brick cottages line elegant boulevards with wide, grassy medians. Garfield Park, once known as Chicago\u2019s Central Park, sits in the 11th\u2019s middle.But on Walnut Street, one vacant lot has been there so long that walking paths are worn through it. Young men gather on this section of the street, and neighbors say they hear calls for \u201cPills!\u201d or \u201cFlats!\u201d\u2014 slang for drugs \u2014 in the middle of the day.In places like this, cycles reinforce themselves: Poverty and joblessness breed an underground economy that leads to jail and makes it harder to get jobs. Struggling, emptying schools result in the closings of the very institutions that hold communities together. Segregation throws up obstacles to economic investment. And people and programs with good intentions come and go, thwarting hopes, reinforcing frustrations while never quite addressing the underlying problems, anyway.Into it all comes a lethal mix of readily available guns, a growing number of splintering gangs and groups, and a sense among some here that the punishment for carrying a weapon on these streets will never be larger than the risk of not carrying one.Three days, 64 people shot, six of them dead: Memorial Day on the streets, and the violence that has engulfed families and neighborhoods.Early on the morning of May 28, a gray car pulled up on Walnut Street, several teenage witnesses told a Times reporter, and men with big guns got out and started firing at other young men on a porch. Shell casings littered the street. The police say witnesses were uncooperative, and no one has been arrested.Within weeks, that shooting was a hazy memory. \u201cNow which one was that?\u201d asked a woman who lives directly across the street.Soon after, neighbors say the large homemade sign of a gun with a condemning slash through it appeared beside a vacant lot. People were unsure who put up the sign, and more have followed, one beneath the clattering \u201cL\u201d train track to downtown, another across from a children\u2019s playground.By November, someone had split the Walnut Street anti-violence sign in two, a curse word scrawled on part of the crumpled remains.\u201cIt\u2019s mostly a camouflage,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cI mean what\u2019s really changed when people are getting shot dead right next to that sign?\u201dWeeks later, less than a block from that shooting on West Wilcox, a preacher led people holding hands in a circle, praying, singing and swaying. The group seemed not to notice as traffic rumbled down Pulaski Road, a crowded strip lined with storefronts promising tax preparation, hairbraiding, candy and liquor.Zaree Pendleton, a stranger to those in the circle, suddenly wandered up, agitated.He said he was recently out of prison and desperately needed help. He carefully set the Bud Light he had been drinking for breakfast on the sidewalk in the center of the swaying circle. Then he reached for the preacher\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019ve been watching y\u2019all out here every morning, praying,\u201d Mr. Pendleton told the group, turning weepy. \u201cY\u2019all want to pray with me?\u201d\u201cThe steel mills, the factories, those big economic engines aren\u2019t there,\u201d said Eric Washington, a deputy chief for the Chicago Police Department and a former commander of the 11th District, \u201cand we need to see what can be the new engines in this district. It can\u2019t be the drug trade.\u201dResidents like Mr. Pendleton say they feel stuck in an economic trap: go to jail for a crime, struggle to find work, wind up back in jail.\u201cPeople have gotten to a place where they don\u2019t have any hope and they don\u2019t feel like they have any hope of getting any,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cYou accept all kinds of ways to make money when you\u2019re hopeless.\u201dMr. Thompson used to live in a gentrifying neighborhood a few miles away, but he moved his family here a dozen years ago. He caught neighbors\u2019 attention when he brought his prayers to the streets. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s a white guy doing over here?\u2019 people would laugh,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow they\u2019re used to me.\u201dMr. Pendleton came to the prayer circle with a plea.\u201cI need a job,\u201d he said. He said he felt lost. \u201cI need everything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an alkie, God knows,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I need a job. I want a job as bad as hell.\u201dMr. Thompson told him: \u201cThe Lord wants to fill you completely, man. You\u2019re trying to fill up with alcohol, but you\u2019re taking a step.\u201dThey made plans to get Mr. Pendleton an identification card \u2014 the first task on what could be a long road to employment. Mr. Pendleton needed to come back with some documents, Mr. Thompson told him.That was weeks ago. Mr. Thompson said Mr. Pendleton had not been back.For visitors, the park is a tourist attraction, a jewel of the city. Its lavish conservatory is jammed with hundreds of exotic plants and a dewy, tropical aroma even through Chicago\u2019s bleakest winter.Yet for many of the people who live here \u2014 some of whom say they rarely enter the conservatory \u2014 Garfield Park can be harrowing. Its nearby side streets, like Gladys, can feel menacing. On a bright afternoon not long ago, a man stepped out of an apartment onto a crowded sidewalk and a gust of wind blew his shirt up, revealing a gun.Residents say the park\u2019s perimeter can be a magnet for drug sales and violence. Seven of the 16 people shot over Memorial Day weekend were nearby.The police say statistics show the park is actually safer than it has been in several years, but Cardell Bradley, who fishes for catfish with sausage bait in the Garfield Park lagoon, said he was cautious. \u201cIf I see a group of people gathering, I get out of here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just heartbreaking to see these kids involved in all this \u2014 they\u2019re only young schoolkids, you know.\u201dRivalries between Chicago\u2019s increasingly splintered gangs and cliques over sales of heroin, Ecstasy, prescription drugs and marijuana have given way to gunfire \u2014 even among small-time sellers who see themselves as only peripherally involved.This year, a baby-faced, dimpled 15-year-old was shot as he rode his bicycle outside his house. \u201cOur block was making a lot of money doing what they\u2019re doing, so I guess people get jealous,\u201d said the teenager, who wore an arm brace for weeks and who says his stomach still aches when he sneezes.The teenager said he only occasionally helped sell drugs and just happened to be there when competitors turned up, armed. At the time, he was enrolled in middle school and working one-on-one with a mentor, who asked that the youth\u2019s name not be published for his safety.The teenager, the mentor said, was registered to attend a \u201cpeace conference\u201d with him on the very evening he was shot.Early on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, a man, 37, was shot in his arm and his leg as he stood in an alley here. Police say the victim was uncooperative. No arrests have been made. An incongruously upbeat song plays loudly along this battered block all day every day: Scott Joplin\u2019s ragtime classic, \u201cThe Entertainer.\u201dThe cheery tune tinkles from a pastel-colored ice cream truck that is permanently parked in a vacant lot on the block where the man was shot in the alley. Mina Marquez, the owner, also lives on the block \u2014 an odd amalgam of empty lots and cared-for homes, now decked with elaborate Christmas displays.In a police district that is mostly black, Ms. Marquez, 35, is unusual. She came from Mexico at 16, and after living in other Chicago neighborhoods, she and her husband and their three children moved to the 11th District because it was a place they could afford. Much of what happens here is driven by economics. People who can afford to leave, do.For Ms. Marquez, plunking down an ice cream truck on an empty lot next door was far cheaper than the family\u2019s effort a few years ago to open in a storefront in a different neighborhood.Competition is scarce here. Sub shops and food marts struggle, and chain stores mostly stay away.But rental prices and other factors have concentrated many of those with government housing vouchers into neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, and kept many black public-housing residents out of richer, whiter areas.Ms. Marquez says her family coexists, if a bit awkwardly, with her customers. \u201cWe don\u2019t let them mess with us,\u201d Ms. Marquez said in Spanish. \u201cThey\u2019re not comfortable that we\u2019re here.\u201dStill, Ms. Marquez, who keeps her two youngest children in view as she stands at the truck window, said she had grown used to life on this block.She said that she sold more than 100 ice creams most days, and that she planned to stay.A line often forms outside the truck, where milkshakes are in high demand.On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, a 24-year-old man was walking along just before 5 a.m. when two men approached, told him to lie down on the ground and shot him. The victim has not cooperated with the police, the police say. No arrests have been made. In this neighborhood, Marconi Elementary Community Academy was once the glue. Since the public school opened decades ago at the corner of Maypole and Kolmar Avenues \u2014 several blocks from where the man was shot over Memorial Day weekend \u2014 best friends were made there, parents kept in touch during drop-offs, children were taught by teachers who had once taught their parents.\u201cWe all went there,\u201d said Kenny Harvey, who attended the school half a century ago and still lives right here.In 2013, though, facing a fiscal crisis, the city closed Marconi and about 50 other public schools. Chicago\u2019s education leaders cited poor student performances and low enrollments in what was then the largest simultaneous closing for any school district in the nation.But six schools here were also shuttered, including Marconi.Tasha Walker, her husband and her oldest daughter had all once gone to Marconi, but she chose not to send her younger daughter on to Tilton. Instead, her children attend charter schools in a different neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019m not letting my kids get lost,\u201d Ms. Walker said.For a brief time, Ms. Walker\u2019s family had lived in a Chicago suburb, and she hopes to save enough money to move again.\u201cI want them to be able to be teenagers,\u201d she said.Sonja Bellephant, 48, grew up in an apartment building just across from the stoop where the two men were shot over Memorial Day weekend. These days, she lives in a Chicago suburb but works as youth director at the church her grandfather started on the corner.\u201cTheir life,\u201d she said of the young people, \u201cI wish it could be like my life.\u201dMs. Bellephant wants to create an urban boarding school for young men in a shuttered, hulking church, school and convent on this block. She envisions an arts studio in a church down the street.She regularly stops strangers, asking if their children are in day care, if they have found a job, if they are in school.\u201cDid you graduate from high school?\u201d she called to a young man one morning. He looked puzzled but said yes, then hiked up his pants.\u201cI want to tell them: \u2018You don\u2019t have to dodge bullets. You can finish school,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bellephant said.Ms. Bellephant, a former public school principal, is one in a vast array of individuals, government agencies, nonprofit groups and religious organizations with ideas for how to fix this area. The mayor\u2019s office this fall announced plans for $36 million for mentoring in areas like this, and for a $100 million fund to bring economic development to neighborhoods.\u201cThe mayor is determined to turn around decades of neglect in the South and West Side neighborhoods that have been challenged by violence for generations,\u201d said the mayor\u2019s spokesman, Adam Collins. Mr. Emanuel\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cwill add nearly 1,000 new police officers, invest new dollars in our most challenged communities, make mentoring universal for young men in high-crime areas, spur economic development, strengthen sentencing for violent gun offenders, and bring together community and faith leaders around a plan to provide at-risk youth with better opportunities.\u201dMissing, though, community leaders say, is a single, overarching blueprint. Mentoring programs come and go with shifting grants. Job programs last a few months.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Tio Hardiman, an activist who founded an anti-violence group that has worked along these blocks. \u201cNobody\u2019s answering to nobody out there. Everybody\u2019s in their own response mode. Sometimes, it\u2019s more gang-banging between the various community groups than it is on the streets.\u201dMs. Bellephant is still trying to figure out how to pay for her urban boarding school. An old banner is plastered on the shuttered building, a vestige from a different plan to turn it into a family life center, gym and school of performing arts. \u201cIt\u2019s on the way 2013,\u201d the banner promises.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Tio Hardiman\u2019s conversation with a community member. It was Madison Street, not Pulaski Road.Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting from Chicago, and Jack Begg and Giovanni Russonello from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: A Battle Over the San Joaquin River", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning. The San Francisco Bay estuary is in crisis.Now, after a decade of work, California water officials are finalizing a more than 3,000-page plan to tackle the problem.But the so-called Bay-Delta plan is shaping up to be among the most contentious battles of California\u2019s long-running water wars.At the heart of the conflict is control over the San Joaquin River and its three main tributaries. Originating in the Sierra Nevada, the rivers eventually drain into the Bay estuary, feeding its unique ecosystem.But along the way, they snake through the drought-hit farm communities of the San Joaquin Valley and a gantlet of dams and diversions for crop irrigation.The State Water Resources Control Board wants to raise the flow of the San Joaquin and the tributary Merced, Stanislaus and Tuolumne Rivers to 40 percent of their natural flow during the critical spring months.\u201cYou are the grim reaper,\u201d Assemblyman Adam Gray, whose district includes Merced, told members of the board at one of a series of public hearings in the San Joaquin Valley this month.\u201cWater is life in this region, and you appear to have no other purpose than to take that life away.\u201dNo matter the final shape of the plan, state officials acknowledge it will have major consequences for wildlife, businesses and jobs. (The state has estimated a $64 million hit to the farming economy; agricultural leaders say it would be much higher.)\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with this very complex puzzle,\u201d said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the water resources board. \u201cThere\u2019s no sweet spot here.\u201dLouie Bandoni, an almond farmer, was among them. Speaking by phone outside the hearing, he said it felt as if state leaders were trying to put farmers out of business over a few fish.\u201cIn California, we\u2019re being bombarded with regulations,\u201d Mr. Bandoni said.\u201cAnd now they\u2019re going after our water,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just to the point as farmers \u2014 we\u2019re just fed up. We don\u2019t know which way to turn.\u201dThe water board plans to make its final decision by summer.12 PhotosThe idea of small-scale, organic farming is in vogue among California consumers for its promise of environmental sustainability and healthy food.But how many shoppers know what small-scale farming looks like?\u201cThe notion was to de-romanticize small-scale organic farming,\u201d Mr. Gieser said. \u201cAnd it was obvious real quick that their work is grueling \u2013 mentally, emotionally, financially and physically.\u201dAs more consumers seek alternatives to industrial farming, Mr. Gieser said small operations like Oya Organics could represent a preview of what the next generation of California farming will look like.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Tom Price Is Eager to Lead H.H.S., and Reduce Its Clout", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 During his 12 years in Congress, Representative Tom Price has made clear what role he thinks the government should play in health care. It can be summed up in one word: less.This position is rooted in Mr. Price\u2019s experience as an orthopedic surgeon for more than 20 years. \u201cAs a physician,\u201d he said in the House in 2007, \u201cI know oh so well how the intervention of the state and federal government into the practice of medicine destroys the ability to take care of people. It makes it so you can\u2019t provide quality health care for children and moms and dads.\u201dThough he has worked for years to shrink the government\u2019s role, Mr. Price, a Georgia Republican, could soon lead a government agency whose expansive mission is to ensure care for more than 100 million Americans. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he has tried to put a lid on federal spending. As secretary, he would be responsible for more than $1 trillion in spending, a number that will surge as the population ages.The health secretary has immense discretion to impose, revoke and modify rules. A review of Mr. Price\u2019s record in Congress, including his speeches and legislative proposals, suggests that he would try to reduce the burden of federal regulations on health care providers, especially doctors.As secretary, he would be responsible for the popular Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which insures eight million children at some point each year. In 2007, he opposed expansion of that program because, he said on the House floor, some children with private insurance would become eligible for \u201cgovernment-run socialized medicine.\u201dTwo years later, as the House debated a huge bill to jolt the economy out of a severe recession, Mr. Price jumped to his feet after spotting an item that provided $1.1 billion for research comparing the effectiveness of different drugs and medical treatments. He denounced it, saying he feared that the findings would be used to decide which items and services would be covered by insurance.\u201cThis is indeed the foundation of rationing of American health care for each and every American,\u201d he said \u2014 a step toward Democrats\u2019 dream of \u201cnationalized health care.\u201dAnd in 2010, when Congress approved the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Price called it \u201ca dark day for America,\u201d saying that \u201cour founders are weeping\u201d over a bill that was \u201can affront to federalism, an affront to individual liberty.\u201dSenate Democrats are sure to challenge many of his positions at his confirmation hearings. Just as they distrust him on health care, he distrusts them.\u201cThe true desire of those on the left,\u201d Mr. Price said on the House floor in 2007, \u201cis to gradually and enticingly move all Americans to Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care.\u201d The bureaucracy, he said, is \u201cnot nimble like the private sector.\u201dMr. Price, whose father and paternal grandfather were also physicians, is a fierce advocate for doctors. But he says his primary concern is for patients. A desire to \u201cempower consumers\u201d has been a theme of his work in Washington.In 2010, he said on the House floor that he had discovered that \u201cthere were more folks in Washington who affected what I could do for and with my patients than anybody I ever met in residency or in medical school.\u201d That, he said, \u201cwas wrong.\u201dMr. Price often reminds colleagues of a sentence in the original Medicare law, passed in 1965: \u201cNothing in this title shall be construed to authorize any federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine.\u201d\u201cWe violate this law all the time,\u201d Mr. Price said in 2005, referring to the government, especially \u201cthe bureaucrats, nonmedical individuals,\u201d who have written reams of rules defining the quality of care.Mr. Price has opposed the Obama administration\u2019s effort to require employers and insurers to provide free coverage of birth control for women, saying it threatens religious freedom. The government should not \u201cdefine and control what constitutes health care,\u201d he said in 2012, voicing a concern he has long expressed.Women\u2019s rights advocates say Mr. Price\u2019s position on birth control is at odds with his antipathy to government interference in health care. Decisions about contraception, they say, should be left to women, in consultation with their doctors.Soon after becoming a House member in 2005, Mr. Price introduced a resolution stating that Congress should move the nation toward a new model of health insurance, in which employers would give employees a certain amount of cash so they could buy insurance on their own, rather than enrolling in a health plan chosen by the employer.\u201cMoving from a defined-benefit system to a defined-contribution system,\u201d he said, would have a big advantage for consumers: They would \u201cown and control\u201d their insurance policies.\u201cThat is a sea change,\u201d Mr. Price said. It means that \u201cpatients can vote with their feet\u201d and go to a different insurer, regardless of whether the cost is paid by Medicare, Medicaid or an employer.\u201cUnleashing the power of choice and competition is the best way to lower health care costs and improve quality,\u201d he said.Democrats have assailed this approach, saying it leaves older Americans to fend for themselves if they need care that costs more than the federal contribution.Many of Mr. Price\u2019s legislative proposals would affect the department he now hopes to lead. The stated purpose of one bill is \u201cto restore to states the freedom and flexibility to regulate health insurance markets.\u201dThe bill would roll back insurance standards prescribed in the Affordable Care Act. Women could again be charged more than men of the same age for similar insurance policies, unless states banned such practices. Some people with pre-existing conditions who allow their insurance to lapse could have difficulty obtaining affordable coverage in the future.Under another one of his bills, consumers could receive tax credits to help pay for insurance, but for many lower-income people, the amount of assistance would be less than what they receive under the Affordable Care Act.Residents of one state might be able to buy insurance more easily from companies in other states. For consumers willing to take more responsibility for the cost of their medical care, it would be easier to set aside money in tax-favored health savings accounts.But people with high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage could face new taxes. And patients who believe they have been injured by negligent doctors could find it more difficult to win damages in court.If confirmed, Mr. Price will have a chance to practice what he has preached for decades. He could try to overhaul what he calls the \u201cpredatory trial lawyer litigation system.\u201d He could try to stop what he calls \u201cregulatory oppression\u201d by the federal government.

The situation has spooked investors, prompting the government to temporarily restrain some trading and to make emergency loans to struggling financial institutions.\u201cThe adjustment has not yet finished,\u201d said Miao Zuoxing, a partner at the FXM Brothers Fund, a Shanghai-based investment fund that trades stocks, bonds and futures. \u201cIt will continue and normalize until money is put where the government can see it.\u201dAt least 40 companies have said they would postpone or cancel bond offerings rather than risk being forced to pay high interest rates to sell the bonds \u2014 or being unable to sell them at all. Among them was the Jiangsu Sumec Group Corporation, an industrial trading house that exports items as varied as gardening tools and auto parts; the company said on Thursday that it would not go through with the sale of $130 million in short-term bonds.\u201cDue to recent, relatively large market fluctuations, our company decided to cancel the issue of the current bond,\u201d Jiangsu Sumec Group said in a statement, \u201cand will reissue it at a chosen time.\u201dChina has particular reason to worry. As the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States, it relies on a rickety financial system that is mired in debt and susceptible to hidden stresses. Higher overseas interest rates could also prompt more Chinese investors to move their money out of the country, either to chase higher returns elsewhere or to avoid what some see as China\u2019s growing problems.The outflows are \u201cadding to domestic banking system stresses and weakening the already fragile foundations of the entire financial system,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University who was formerly chief of the China division at the International Monetary Fund.A healthy bond market is crucial to China\u2019s restructuring plans. The country has been counting on its fast-growing bond market as one way to bring market discipline to its traditionally state-directed \u2014 and wasteful \u2014 economy.In the mature financial system of the United States, businesses have plenty of ways to get money. They can borrow from a bank, raise money selling stocks or bonds, or seek funds directly from any number of investors.But in China, state-run banks are by far the main source of funding. That helped power the country\u2019s economic rise, but it also led to loans going to politically connected borrowers rather than to where the economy needed it most. That is one reason the Chinese economy is now stuck with more steel, glass, cement and auto factories than it needs.Particularly in the past two years, China has taken steps to encourage the development of robust stock and bond markets as well as private lenders, needing a way to ensure the flow of money was being directed by profit-minded investors rather than politicians and their allies at state-owned banks.The stock market crashed last year, and private lending has been slow to take off. But until this past week, the bond market had performed well. The investment arms of local governments and other large borrowers rushed in recent months to issue bonds at low interest rates and to pay off bank loans issued at higher rates \u2014 just as the government intended. Bond issuance jumped 47 percent in the first 11 months of this year from the same period last year.What the government did not foresee was an explosion of speculative bond trading by Chinese banks.Still, it is becoming increasingly clear that many of them are backed by bonds. The bond holdings of wealth management products more than doubled over the 18-month period that ended in June. Adding to the risks, banks are also making large, leveraged bets on the direction of bond prices.Now the government is moving to rein it in. On Monday evening, The Financial News, a newspaper controlled by China\u2019s central bank, published questions and answers with a central bank official who was identified only as being in charge of the reviews of banks\u2019 financial soundness. The official told the newspaper that starting next year, the central bank would include wealth management products in these reviews.A press officer at the central bank confirmed that the interview was an accurate reflection of the institution\u2019s views but declined to elaborate.On Tuesday, the yield on one-year government bonds rose to 3.11 percent, compared with 2.35 percent two weeks ago, a considerable jump for bonds. Yields go up when bond prices go down, and a higher yield makes it more expensive to issue bonds.Corporate bond yields are also rising fast, as investors have begun demanding a better return from entrusting their money to China\u2019s frequently opaque companies. That reverses a trend from this year, when investors were so enthusiastic for Chinese bonds that they bought corporate bonds as well, narrowing the natural spread between government and corporate bonds.Mr. Miao, of FXM Brothers, predicted that corporate bonds would continue to sell off until the spread between government corporate yields was wider again.\u201cWhen the corporate bubble has burst,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we could say the adjustment is finished.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 Bank Challenges for Italy\u2019s Next Prime Minister", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCleaning up Italy\u2019s banks is an opportunity ripe for the wasting. The failed referendum on Sunday need not cause a crisis if UniCredit completes its rights issue and fellow lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena can be quickly stabilized. Political turmoil and weak growth, though, could push up bad loan levels, and the political will to fix them may be lacking.First is to ensure there is not a bank run. Fortunately, such a panic looks unlikely and unnecessary. Banks have access to European Central Bank liquidity, and government bond prices, which determine the value of their collateral, have been stable.Third on the new leader\u2019s list will be UniCredit. It wants to raise more money than Monte dei Paschi, possibly as much as 13 billion euros, or about $14 billion. But it is larger, healthier and under less pressure to raise funds quickly. If both Monte dei Paschi and UniCredit can be fixed, then a crisis is unlikely. Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca need more capital, and could need to write down their subordinated debt, but they are small.Finally, there is the problem in the longer term of banks\u2019 balance-sheet fragility. Bad debts could increase if the weak economy becomes weaker \u2014 as it may without a strong reform-minded prime minister. Banks may struggle to generate earnings to sell the nonperforming loans they have. The large listed banks could need another 21 billion euros, or about $22.7 billion, Mediobanca reckons.Italy could seize this moment to create a single entity to help the banks sell their bad debt and accelerate bankruptcy reforms. That would mean imposing losses on some local investors. But if Mr. Renzi could not do that, it\u2019s unlikely his successor will. A weak government leaves the banks in purgatory \u2014 but not quite hell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Austria\u2019s Far Right Signs a Cooperation Pact With Putin\u2019s Party", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 The leader of the Austrian far-right Freedom Party has signed what he called a cooperation agreement with Russia\u2019s ruling party and recently met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the designated national security adviser to President-elect Donald J. Trump of the United States.Word of the agreement with Russia was the latest sign that the Kremlin is forging bonds with political parties across Europe in what some European leaders suspect is a coordinated attempt to meddle in their affairs and potentially weaken Western democracies. Many of these efforts are murky and involve obscure groups, and it is unclear whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has any direct involvement.The Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, reported the signing of the agreement with United Russia, Mr. Putin\u2019s party, on Monday on his Facebook page, where he also disclosed that he had visited General Flynn a few weeks ago in Trump Tower in New York.\u201cInternationally, the Freedom Party continues to gain in influence,\u201d wrote Mr. Strache, a dental technician who has led the party since 2005.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.The Trump transition team did not respond to request for comment on the meeting.The Freedom Party, founded in the 1950s by ex-Nazis, surged this year to nearly capture the largely ceremonial presidency of Austria in May, but was defeated in a final runoff on Dec. 4. Still, its ascendance, alongside the rise of rightist parties in many European countries and with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, has raised new questions about political realignment across the continent.Mr. Strache\u2019s trips to New York and Moscow were clearly intended to convey the impression that the Freedom Party, which still leads all opinion polls ahead of the two mainstream parties that have governed Austria since World War II, has international standing and intends to continue vying for power.A text of the cooperation agreement, published in Russian on the website of United Russia and in German on the website of an Austrian journalist, Claus Pandi, outlined plans for regular meetings and collaboration where suitable on economic, business and political projects. It said the accord was valid for five years, but was not legally binding.It was signed for United Russia by Sergei Zheleznyak, a deputy to the party\u2019s general secretary who is among the Russian officials barred from the United States since March 2014 for supporting the Russian actions in Crimea.In welcoming the Austrians at party headquarters, Mr. Zheleznyak specifically mentioned Europe\u2019s \u201cmigration crisis\u201d as a field for cooperation, according to United Russia\u2019s website.The Freedom Party presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, had indicated he might use a little-noticed power of the president to dismiss the federal government, or at least some ministers, a move most observers forecast would precipitate new national elections.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Aside from sowing domestic ferment in Austria, a Freedom Party-led government would press to lift the sanctions imposed on Moscow for its 2014 seizure of Crimea and meddling in war-torn eastern Ukraine. On Facebook, Mr. Strache said Monday that having the United States and Russia stand together would be important to solving the crises in Syria and Crimea and \u201cto get rid of the sanctions that damage the economy and are in the end useless.\u201dAustria jealously guards its neutrality, adopted after the allies withdrew from the country in 1955, and there is considerable nostalgia for the Cold War role played by Vienna as a venue for United States-Soviet summits.In that spirit, the Freedom Party has long leaned toward Moscow. In the presidential campaign, Mr. Hofer had argued strongly that European sanctions imposed on Moscow should be dropped, a stance he reiterated in a lengthy interview with Russian television late last week.Russian media loyal to the Kremlin have emphasized for over a year that the influx of some one million migrants, many of them Muslim, has divided and weakened Europe, where Germany, Austria and Sweden bore the main burden of absorbing the newcomers.The Freedom Party is also anti-migrant, and seeks deep changes in the European Union, while stopping short of calls to follow Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc.Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy speaker of the Duma, or lower house of Russian Parliament, said there was a need for open dialogue to improve ties with parties across Europe, United Russia reported from the signing of the agreement. This was especially important, Mr. Tolstoy was quoted as saying, \u201cin today\u2019s politically correct world, when everyone is hiding their real thoughts and feelings.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump has cited the pledge as a sign that he could persuade the private sector to lead improvements in the national economy.The OneWeb investment does not come from the Vision fund, a spokesman for SoftBank said. Instead it will come directly from SoftBank, as yet another investment in technology it views as potentially disruptive. (SoftBank is providing $1 billion of the investment, while the rest is coming from OneWeb investors.)During its history, SoftBank has struck deals for stakes in companies including the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, the online lender SoFi and the Chinese ride-hailing start-up Didi Chuxing.The new deal will give SoftBank and its partners nearly half of OneWeb, a four-year-old start-up based in Arlington, Va., that aims to beam internet access to unconnected areas of the world through satellites it intends to launch. Greg Wyler, who founded OneWeb, said in an interview that it wanted to bring the internet to every unconnected school in the world by 2022, then provide reasonably priced internet throughout the world five years later by making about 720 satellites and putting them into orbit.SoftBank is joining a list of OneWeb partners that includes Airbus, Qualcomm, Richard Branson of the Virgin Group and the satellite company Intelsat.Mr. Wyler said in the interview that the job creation number came from estimates of jobs that had been or would be created in its ranks and at partners like Qualcomm. Many of the jobs, he said, would be at OneWeb\u2019s satellite manufacturing plant in Exploration Park, Fla., which is a joint venture with Airbus.Advertisement"}

But he needed nearly $1.3 million to buy it and turn it into the sort of Brooklyn dream home for which the city\u2019s lawyers and bankers pay big money.No problem. For funding, Mr. Dahill borrowed money from a new and eager group of international financiers: middle-class Chinese investors.\u201cI don\u2019t discriminate if someone wants to finance the property we developed,\u201d said the 36-year-old Mr. Dahill, who works as a mortgage broker by day. \u201cChinese? Great. American? Fine. I don\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re interested.\u201dA new generation of smartphone apps and online lending platforms in China and around the world are helping small investors leap legal and language barriers to put their money to work globally. This informal lending network \u2014 which allows Chinese investors to fund overseas projects and buyers \u2014 largely bypasses banks and other traditional sources of funds, bringing money to places as varied as a sports center in Illinois and apartment blocks in Tennessee.\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of resentment,\u201d said Angelo Richardson, a 45-year-old self-described entrepreneur who lives nearby. Mr. Richardson, who has lived in Brooklyn for 24 years, said his monthly rent had nearly doubled to $1,500 from $900 in just two years.These new financial platforms \u201chire really good lawyers,\u201d says Xiaochen Zhang, a co-founder of the advocacy group CrowdFund China Society. \u201cThis is still a gray area, so lawyers play a big role.\u201dZhang Xiaowen, a 36-year-old serial entrepreneur from Jiangsu Province in China, put up about $4,500 that Mr. Dahill tapped on an online lending platform. The deal promised a quick 13 percent return that \u2014 crucially, for Mr. Zhang \u2014 will be paid in American dollars. Mr. Zhang initially invested Chinese renminbi, meaning he is effectively moving part of his wealth offshore.\u201cOtherwise,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201ctransferring money out of the country can be so difficult.\u201dSo far, the new investing channels have largely been unaffected. Mobile apps like Niuniu, Jimubox and Tiger Stocks allow investors to buy and sell foreign stocks from their smartphone. Online portals allow them to pool their money to buy a piece of international real estate outright, or to fund buyers abroad like Mr. Dahill in New York.Unlike other ways China\u2019s wealthy invest abroad, these new services are often priced for ordinary people. Micai, a \u201crobo-adviser\u201d app that also provides online investment services, has an investment threshold of $5,000. Wealth Migrate, a South African crowdfunding platform that was introduced in China this year, is experimenting with $100 real estate investment products.\u201cThe Chinese people have the same needs as other investors,\u201d said Scott Picken, the chief executive of Wealth Migrate. \u201cThey want wealth preservation and peace of mind.\u201dMr. Zhang, the investor who partly backed Mr. Dahill\u2019s property, made his investment through the website of Haitou360, a New York-based investment service with offices in China. Haitou360 \u2014 the Chinese portion means \u201cto throw into the sea\u201d \u2014 then aggregated investments from clients to buy loan packages from well-known American crowdfunding platforms like RealtyMogul and Patch of Land.China limits Chinese currency transfers abroad by individuals to no more than $50,000 worth a year. But Haitou360 structures its investments so that a legal entity essentially acts on behalf of individual investors, bypassing those limits.\u201cWe solve multiple problems \u2014 we manage the risk of overseas real estate investment, and we overcome the capital control limits everyone has,\u201d said Jerry Wang, the chief executive of Haitou360. The structure puts the onus on individual investors to make sure they comply with China\u2019s capital controls, he said.Through these channels, Chinese money has found its way into real estate projects far beyond a few Brooklyn brownstones: homes in New Jersey, medical facilities in Georgia, motel chains. Oversea Crowd, a Chinese private equity firm, has used crowdfunding to raise investments starting at $10,000 from Chinese clients to help fund several luxury student apartments near public universities in Georgia and North Carolina. Their latest apartment complex financed through crowdfunding will soon open near Harvard\u2019s business school.For investors, the returns depend on the period of investment \u2014 sometimes up to five years, other times, only 30 days. On average, longer-term investments have returns of 9 to 11 percent. The company collects an upfront fee, usually equal to a percentage of the investment. Investors receive returns in foreign currency, usually dollars.Before he helped fund Mr. Dahill\u2019s loan for the Brooklyn brownstone, Mr. Zhang, the Haitou360 investor, invested a small amount of money online as a test. Two months later he received a return of a little more than $6, a tiny amount but one that won his trust in online investment.He is now considering a \u201cstudy abroad\u201d investment product that would allow him to begin investing in American real estate immediately. Future returns would be directly transferred monthly to his son, now a child, to pay for tuition and living costs if he were to attend college in the United States.Some on the receiving end of that money flow are looking for ways to deal with it. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Halsey Street is in transition. Down the street from Mr. Dahill\u2019s house, city notices and plywood affixed to brownstones denote more homes under construction. Another house nearby had a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign.Block associations are asking local homeowners to let them know before listing a home so that they can tap nearby residents to find potential buyers.\u201cWe are seeing international investors who are spending money and moving on properties here. It is changing the complexion of the community,\u201d said Tremaine Wright, the chairwoman of Community Board 3, the representative body for Bedford-Stuyvesant. She is a lifelong resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant whose parents and grandparents have also lived in the neighborhood.\u201cBed-Stuy has long been a community of people who owned their homes and resided in their homes,\u201d she added. \u201cNow it\u2019s being changed into a place where a lot of people are investing money and not making a longer-term commitment.\u201dEmily Feng reported from Beijing and Alexandra Stevenson reported from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Populist Anger Rising, Italy May Be Next Domino to Fall", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byTURIN, Italy \u2014 Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, only 41, once seemed to have solved the riddle of how to survive Europe\u2019s populist, anti-establishment tempest. But with a critical national referendum on Sunday, the populist wave is now threatening to crush him and plunge Italy into a political crisis when the European Union is already reeling.From Washington to Brussels to Berlin, fears are rising that Italy may be stumbling into its own \u201cBrexit\u201d moment. What should be an inward-looking referendum on whether to overhaul Italy\u2019s ossified political and electoral system has taken on much broader import. Financial analysts warn of a potential banking crisis, and pro-Europe supporters fear that a \u201cno\u201d vote in the referendum could accelerate the populist movement across the European bloc.Mr. Renzi\u2019s supporters have taken to calling his opponents in the internet-born, populist Five Star Movement \u201cTrumpisti.\u201d They accuse their opponents\u2019 numerous blogs and websites of flooding the Facebook accounts of young people with anti-Renzi, pro-Russian fake news. The referendum has essentially become a referendum on Mr. Renzi, who gave extra motivation to his political enemies by vowing to resign if voters reject the proposed political changes.\u201cA \u2018no\u2019 vote is a vote against Renzi,\u201d said Matteo Roselli, 25, a liberal activist who spent a recent rainy evening in Turin handing out leaflets encouraging people to vote \u201cno.\u201dWith polls indicating that Mr. Renzi may fail, the possibility that he could resign, and force new elections or perhaps bring a caretaker government, has alarmed many leaders, including President Obama, who honored the Italian prime minister in his final state dinner in Washington and urged him to \u201chang around for a while no matter what.\u201dIf Mr. Renzi does step aside, it could open the way for opponents who have threatened to carry the Continent\u2019s fourth-largest economy out of the euro currency zone.Such a prospect could destabilize the shaky Italian economy; have serious implications for Italy\u2019s troubled banking system, which has been in crisis for a decade; and have a contagion effect around the eurozone.\u201cThe problem with Italian banks is they are fragile and they are really big,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cBanks of that caliber, as soon as you have any noise and rumors, it creates a really bad loop.\u201dMr. Renzi, who captured Italians\u2019 imagination by positioning himself as an outsider who would demolish an arthritic political system, is arguing that the constitutional overhaul proposed in the Sunday referendum would streamline government and create more stability in a country that has had 63 governments in 70 years. To speed up the often clogged legislative process, Mr. Renzi wants to drastically reduce the size of the Italian Senate and make it a mostly consultative body. Critically, the Senate would lose the power to bring down governing coalitions.The beneficiary of that erosion appears to be the Five Star Movement, with its ability to win voters on the left and right with a mix of social liberalism, economic populism and tough law-and-order talk. It has been led by Beppe Grillo, 68, a former comedian who last month called Mr. Renzi a \u201cserial killer\u201d and celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a blunt rejection of the establishment.In recent years, the merrily vulgar Mr. Grillo has stepped back so that a new generation of less rough, but perhaps no less radical, young politicians could step forward.Here in Turin, Chiara Appendino, 32, beat Mr. Renzi\u2019s favored Democratic Party candidate for mayor this year. In the election, she had the support of Mr. Roselli and many like him.\u201cOur voters are mainly young voters,\u201d Ms. Appendino said after stepping out of the chandeliered City Hall chamber. \u201cI believe there really is a generation of young people, and I feel in some way that I represent them, who have desire and ability, but who cannot get ahead.\u201dMs. Appendino, who speaks German, French and English and is considered a rising star in her party, said that she did not consider herself anti-European, but she argued that the current European Union did not work.Far from breaking with the establishment, Mr. Renzi had been co-opted by its bankers, bureaucrats and power brokers, she said.Mr. Renzi is desperately trying to persuade Italians, a large slice of them still undecided, to back him.\u201cToday, we mustn\u2019t get stuck in nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Renzi told a crowd this week in Lingotto, the section of Turin that was once home to the automaker Fiat. \u201cWe must work for the future of our children.\u201dBut even his young supporters worry that those words are wasted on the Italian youth, who as in so many other European countries are often unemployed.In France, where the far-right National Front has emerged as a force, the youth unemployment rate is around 25 percent. And that looks good compared with Greece and Spain, both with more than 40 percent youth unemployment and strong populist movements.In Italy, Mr. Renzi\u2019s 2015 labor market overhaul, hailed by many investors, has so far failed to be the boon to employment his government expected. The youth unemployment rate is still around 35 percent. In the country\u2019s south, where opposition to the change is solid, it is nearly 50 percent.\u201cThe young are lined up against him,\u201d Davide Giani, 20, said with a resigned shrug after an afternoon spent trying to hand out leaflets in support of a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the referendum only to see young Turinese turn them down. \u201cThey see this as an opportunity to lash out against the establishment.\u201dBack in the summer, Mr. Renzi predicted the gathering storm as he flew on the Italian Air Force One but nevertheless strained to see a silver lining in the unwrinkled faces of his new rivals.\u201cThe good thing is that since we have come to power, there has been a generational leap forward,\u201d Mr. Renzi said, adding that his likely opponents, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini, the young leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Renzi Northern League, would be younger than he is. \u201cGreat!\u201d he said. \u201cA sign that something has changed.\u201dSome of Mr. Renzi\u2019s older enemies across the political spectrum are latching onto the referendum to return to relevance. For them, the prospect of his premature exit has had the effect of a curtain call after a bloody opera, reanimating vengeful antagonists for a final bow on center stage.Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 80, mindful that Mr. Renzi needs moderate center-right supporters, reversed his previous support for the constitutional overhaul out of sudden fear of \u201cauthoritarian drift.\u201dIn Turin, former Prime Minister Massimo D\u2019Alema, a member of Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party who has received little deference from the current leader, delivered a disdain-dripping speech to mobilize elderly liberals and former communists against the change.\u201cHe presents himself like the one who wants to rejuvenate the country, but the young people are against him,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alema, 67, said in an interview, in which he mocked Mr. Renzi as a Twitter-obsessed \u201coaf\u201d who had alienated labor unions and destroyed the left.Mr. Renzi\u2019s young supporters shudder at the very mention of Italy\u2019s former leaders. On a rainy evening in Milan, Alessia Giuliani, 24, sat in a field office for the \u201cyes\u201d campaign hunched over lists of phone numbers she had spent the day calling in support of Mr. Renzi\u2019s changes.She spoke optimistically about all the older people who, having lived through scores of Italian governments, proclaimed their hope and confidence in Mr. Renzi.But asked if she had had any luck persuading young people, her smile vanished and her hand landed woefully on her forehead.\u201cIn general, the young voters are disinterested or for \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d explained her colleague, Stefano Angelinis, 24. \u201cMany young people are going for Five Star.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve been thinking of the Crutchers because of the debate raging in the Democratic Party about its future. One faction argues that the left became too focused on \u201cidentity politics,\u201d fighting for the rights of Muslims, gays, blacks and Latinos but neglecting themes of economic justice that would appeal to everyone, working-class whites in particular.Lilla and Sanders have a legitimate point, and it\u2019s clear in retrospect that the Democrats should have talked more about jobs and fairness for all. But Lilla and Sanders\u2019s argument also collides with the basic truth that it\u2019s not possible to have a serious conversation about justice, jobs and opportunity in America without talking frankly about race, gender and ethnicity.Consider the Crutcher family: Each of the children\u2019s deaths wasn\u2019t exactly about race, yet each was linked to it. Young black men are disproportionately likely to be stopped by police officers, and shot dead by them. Crib death and cancer both are more lethal among African-Americans, because of disparities in incomes and health care. And crime in America disproportionately involves blacks, as both victims and arrested perpetrators.So, sure, Democrats sometimes go overboard with identity and can do a far better job appealing to ALL who have been left behind \u2014 but identity still matters profoundly. The Crutchers have lost four young people, each in a way that statistically suggests a racial element.How can we discuss a way forward without acknowledging that race is an issue here?The blunt truth is that America\u2019s most egregious failures have often involved identity, from slavery to anti-Catholic riots, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment of Japanese-Americans, from unequal pay to acquiescence in domestic violence and sex trafficking. Ditto for the threats by President-Elect Donald Trump to deport 11 million immigrants or to register Muslims.Yet Lilla and Sanders are right that identity sometimes has distracted from the distress in working-class white America. Life expectancy for blacks, Latinos and other groups has been increasing; for middle-aged whites, it has been dropping. Likewise, the race gap in education used to be greater than the \u201cclass gap\u201d; now the class gap is greater.It\u2019s also true that broad efforts to create opportunity would help not only working-class whites, but also working-class blacks, Latinos and others.So do we really need to choose between identity and justice? Can\u2019t we treat both cancers?\u201cEvery night, my wife and I cry because we see our son with his hands up,\u201d he said. But he added, speaking of the officer who shot him: \u201cShe\u2019s got people around her who are hurting, too. My heart goes out to her.\u201dCrutcher is modeling the broadest possible inclusiveness. Yes, there\u2019s a tension between focusing on bigotry and highlighting jobs. Yes, Democrats should more clearly emphasize economic justice for all, including struggling whites. But I hope that Democrats won\u2019t needlessly squabble over whether to prioritize identity or justice.Like Reverend Crutcher, we can reach for both.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mental Health Crisis in Trump\u2019s America", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byA few days after Donald J. Trump was elected president, I started getting anxious phone calls from some of my patients. They were not just worried about the direction President-elect Trump might take the nation, but about how they were going to fare, given their longstanding and serious mental illnesses.\u201cWill I still have insurance and have my medications covered?\u201d one depressed patient asked me.As a psychiatrist, I wish that I could be more reassuring to my patients during a highly stressful political transition, but in truth, they have reason to worry.Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, and his pick for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is a staunch opponent of Obamacare. The 2010 law provides medical coverage to an estimated 20 million Americans and specifically included mental health and substance abuse treatment as one of 10 \u201cessential benefits\u201d that all private insurers and Medicaid have to cover.For the 43.6 million American adults living with a psychiatric illness and the 16.3 million who have an alcohol use disorder, it is hard to exaggerate the importance of this. Until this law was passed, people with mental illness and substance abuse problems were subject to capricious annual or lifetime limits on coverage, higher deductibles or no coverage at all.Obamacare changed all that and mandated that psychiatric disorders be treated on a par with non-psychiatric medical illnesses like cancer and heart disease.It also prohibited the exclusion of people with pre-existing illness from medical coverage, which was an enormous boon for the mentally ill. Three-quarters of all serious mental disorders in adults \u2014 like major depression, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders \u2014 are present by age 25. So mental disorders are largely chronic illnesses that, while very treatable, are still characterized by relapses and recurrences.There seemed to be a brief glimmer of hope when, last month, Mr. Trump suggested that he was open to keeping the rules about coverage for pre-existing conditions even after getting rid of Obamacare. But Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, cast doubt on that. Mr. Price has proposed that insurers be required to cover pre-existing conditions only so long as an individual has had continuous coverage for the past year and a half. But many people with mental illness have lapses in employment and could easily fall through the cracks under a plan like that.Obamacare isn\u2019t perfect. No legislative action can erase the stigma surrounding mental illness, which is a major barrier to getting good treatment. Nor can it solve the serious shortage of mental health specialists or the limited access to psychiatric treatment, especially in rural areas.Still, if President-elect Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the law, he will effectively strip millions of Americans with mental illness overnight of the most medically rational and humane benefits they have ever had \u2014 without giving them any indication of what, if anything, will replace them.The consequences would be quick and devastating. Psychiatrically ill Americans who lost their coverage would be forced to seek treatment in emergency rooms, causing a meteoric rise in health care costs. And untreated mental disorders like depression, bipolar illness and schizophrenia would almost certainly lead to higher suicide rates.The current annual cost to society of treating depression alone is $210 billion \u2014 60 percent of which represents reduced efficiency at work and costs related to suicide. With a reduction in mental health care, this bill will balloon. In other words, untreated mental illness is not just a source of individual morbidity, mortality and immense suffering; it is also a largely preventable drain on our economy.There is at least one more reason to worry about mental health in the age of Trump. Mr. Trump has said that Congress should give each state a lump sum of federal money for Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income people. This would effectively roll back the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, which provided coverage to an additional 12 million people in 31 states. Since people with mental illness are far more likely to receive public insurance like Medicaid than private insurance, this will hurt them disproportionately.America can\u2019t be great if millions of our citizens with medical and psychiatric illnesses lose their insurance coverage. An anxious nation is rooting for Mr. Trump not to let that happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Myanmar, a Glittering Heritage", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 When Thiri Tin Htut was growing up here in the 1970s, she and her three sisters would play by pretending to sell each other gemstones.But the rubies and sapphires in their small hands were real, she recalled, and her parents allowed the game only after their daughters were old enough to not swallow the merchandise.Myanmar\u2019s precious stones are known abroad for their exceptionally high quality, and Ms. Thiri Tin Htut\u2019s family has been in the gem business since the 19th century: Her great-great-grandfather, U Hmat, was the chief ruby miner for Thibaw, the country\u2019s last imperial king, and later generations worked as gem miners or traders in Myanmar, Thailand and Europe.So when Ms. Thiri Tin Htut returned to Myanmar in 1995 after living for a decade in Thailand, Switzerland and the United States, opening an artisanal jewelry boutique with one of her sisters seemed like a natural career move, she said.\u201cI had a lot of gemstones to play around with, so I could be creative,\u201d Ms. Thiri Tin Htut, 44, said on a recent afternoon at the boutique, Manawmaya House of Jewels. \u201cI was not confined to making mainstream commercial stuff.\u201dIts nondescript exterior makes it look like an ordinary residence. But the two-floor showroom inside has glass cabinets full of jewelry that sparkles with rare rubies and sapphires, along with other precious and semiprecious stones.All of the jewelry is handmade on the premises by a dozen craftspeople, and about 90 percent of the gemstones are from Myanmar, Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said. Her prices start at about $2,000 per piece.As the boutique\u2019s chief designer, she said that her aesthetic incorporates contemporary, antique, Western and Asian elements, and that the looks of her pieces can vary widely, depending on her mood.Some customers ask her to repeat designs, she added, but she always refuses.\u201cI say, \u2018I can make it similar, but not exactly the same,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI prefer not to, because I want everyone who buys a piece of jewelry from me to feel special and unique.\u201dMs. Thiri Tin Htut is opinionated and independent, \u201cand it somehow comes through in the pieces,\u201d said M. H. Au, a client in Hong Kong who discovered Manawmaya House on a trip to Yangon in 2014.Ms. Au said in a telephone interview that the boutique\u2019s jewelry blends traditional and contemporary styles in a way that sets it apart from both local jewelry markets and international brands.\u201cI have to say, I was really pleasantly surprised,\u201d she said.But Myanmar has undergone a dramatic political transition since 2012, when its first free parliamentary election in decades ended a long and painful period of military rule. Since then, the United States has been gradually easing the economic sanctions that it had imposed on many sectors of Myanmar\u2019s economy.Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said that she welcomed the lifting of the American sanctions and hoped the move would lead to more transparency in Myanmar\u2019s gemstone sector.But for her, gems and jewelry have always been more personal than political.She said that people in her family talk of a legend in which her great-great-grandfather, Mr. Hmat, heard a voice urging him to climb atop his village hut at midnight.When he did, the legend goes, he saw a sky full of meteors. And when he visited the valley where the meteors had landed, he discovered that they were gemstones.There were too many to carry home, \u201cso he decided to build a house and just live there,\u201d Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said. \u201cThat was the story of how he became very rich.\u201dHe later worked as the chief ruby miner for King Thibaw, Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said, and his eldest daughter married into the royal family of the Momeik Kingdom, which ruled over Mogok\u2019s ruby mines at the time. The marriage helped to secure the family\u2019s access to the mines.\u201cHe was a pretty good diplomat,\u201d Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said with a chuckle.A son from the marriage, Sao Hkun Hkio, served as a foreign minister of Burma, a former British colony, after it gained independence in 1948, she said. But other family members stayed in the gem business and operated gem shops in Europe in the early 20th century.\u201cMy mother used to tell me that in those days, you could send a stone from Mogok to Europe by just putting a stamp on it and putting it in the mailbox,\u201d Ms. Thiri Tin Htut recalled. \u201cIt took two or three months, because it went by ship, but nothing got lost along the way.\u201dWhen generals seized control of Myanmar in a 1962 coup, Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said, her grandfather dynamited the family\u2019s Mogok mines, and the family began to focus exclusively on gem trading.Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said that she returned to Myanmar in 1995 at the urging of one of her sisters. She later assumed control of the jewelry boutique, although her elder sister, a gemologist who now lives in Bangkok, is still involved.Competition from other Yangon jewelry shops is increasing as Myanmar\u2019s economy opens up, she said, and it is unclear whether anyone from the next generation of her family will eventually take over the business.But compared with her eldest daughter, she added, her younger one, who is 13, so far seems \u201ca bit more keen on jewelry.\u201d\u201cShe likes making and wearing\u201d it, Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Says It Will Run Entirely on Renewable Energy in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byMINCO, Okla. \u2014 Last year, Google consumed as much energy as the city of San Francisco. Next year, it said, all of that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels.The online giant said on Tuesday that all of its data centers around the world will be entirely powered with renewable energy sources sometime next year.This is not to say that Google computers will consume nothing but wind and solar power. Like almost any company, Google gets power from a power company, which operates an energy grid typically supplied by a number of sources, including hydroelectric dams, natural gas, coal and wind power.What Google has done over the last decade, with relatively little fanfare, is participate in a number of large-scale deals with renewable producers, typically guaranteeing to buy the energy they produce with their wind turbines and solar cells. With those guarantees, wind companies can obtain bank financing to build more turbines.The power created by the renewables is plugged into the utility grid, so that Google\u2019s usage presents no net consumption of fossil fuels and the pool of electricity gets a relatively larger share of renewable sources.\u201cWe are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world,\u201d said Joe Kava, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, good for business and good for our shareholders.\u201dUnlike carbon-based power, Mr. Kava said, wind supply prices do not fluctuate, enabling Google to plan better. In addition, the more renewable energy it buys, the cheaper those sources get. In some places, like Chile, Google said, renewables have at times become cheaper than fossil fuels.Whether Google is the largest buyer of renewables would be difficult to verify, as many industries do not release data on how much energy they consume. There is no doubt, however, that Google\u2019s large computer complexes, along with similar global operations by Amazon and Microsoft, are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing new consumers of electricity.Google hopes that success in working with large wind farms, like the 50,000-acre facility in Minco, Okla., which supplies Google\u2019s large data center in Pryor, Okla., will spur development of the industry. NextEra Energy, which owns the wind farm, has about 115 wind farms in the United States and Canada.About 25 percent of United States electricity goes to businesses, and companies like Google are now about 2 percentage points of that. Dominion Virginia Power, located in a state with perhaps the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, last year had a demand increase from those customers of 9 percent, while overall demand was nearly flat, according to Dominion.Google operates eight different businesses, including internet search engines, YouTube and Gmail, each of which has over 1 billion customers. They run on a global network of 13 large-scale data centers, each one a complex of many buildings containing hundreds of thousands of computers.The 5.7 terawatt-hours of electricity Google consumed in 2015 \u201cis equal to the output of two 500 megawatt coal plants,\u201d said Jonathan Koomey, a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences at Stanford. That is enough for two 140,000-person towns. \u201cFor one company to be doing this is a very big deal. It means other companies of a similar scale will feel pressure to move.\u201dIt moves the needle on costs to have a big consumer, Mr. Koomey added, since a larger market tends to allow for economies of scale and more innovation. \u201cEvery time you double production, you reduce the cost of solar by about 20 percent. Wind goes down 10 to 12 percent,\u201d he said.Facebook has entered into similar deals with wind producers. Last week, Amazon reiterated its long-term commitment to power its machines entirely with renewable energy, though for 2016 it expects to be above about 40 percent of its goal. It has announced five more solar projects.Microsoft says it has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2014, but much of this comes from the purchase of carbon offsets, which are investments in things like tree planting or renewables projects meant to compensate for the fossil fuels a company consumes. The company hopes to have half of its electric power supplied from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources by 2018. Its data centers currently use about 3.3 million megawatt-hours of power a year.Critics note that while Google might be adding wind and solar to the world\u2019s power grid, overall it is still dependent on fossil fuels, since sun and wind power are intermittent, while demand for things like YouTube cat videos is continual.\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s a P.R. gimmick,\u201d said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank in Washington supported largely by donations from individuals and companies in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf they think they can actually support themselves with wind and solar panels, they should connect them directly to their data centers.\u201dNext year\u2019s goal will be 95 percent accomplished with wind turbines around the world, Mr. Kava said, and Google\u2019s support for the industry could keep prices dropping, particularly relative to things like coal. \u201cWe\u2019re technology-agnostic, but we\u2019re not price-agnostic,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated title for Jonathan Koomey at Stanford. He is a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences, not a research fellow at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.Advertisement"}

He was 99.His son-in-law, Lubomir H\u00fcbner, confirmed Mr. Burger\u2019s death to iDNES, a Czech news site.Mr. Burger\u2019s skills as a printer in Slovakia led first to his incarceration, and then to his unlikely survival.Arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 in Bratislava for forging baptismal certificates for fellow Jews to avoid Nazi persecution, he was sent to Auschwitz with his first wife, Gisella, who was killed in the camp\u2019s gas chambers. But after Mr. Burger was shipped to Birkenau, Auschwitz\u2019s companion camp, his profession became an advantage: The Nazis were looking for prisoners to work on their ambitious counterfeiting scheme.Mr. Burger, Prisoner No. 64401, recalled the moment the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, recruited him to Operation Bernhard, which was named for its leader, SS Major Bernhard Kr\u00fcger.\u201cHerr Burger!\u201d the commandant said. \u201cWe need people like you. You\u2019ll be sent to Berlin. You will work as a free man and I wish you every success.\u201dBeing selected along with about 140 other prisoners to work in Block 19 at Sachsenhausen, which was about 20 miles north of Berlin, afforded Mr. Burger privileges \u2014 but none of the freedom that H\u00f6ss had promised.\u201cI always said I was a dead man on holiday,\u201d Mr. Burger told the historian Roger Morrison. \u201cWe never believed we would get out of there. But in the block we had everything \u2014 food, white sheets on the bed. Each one of us had his own bed; not like Birkenau, where six of us slept under a single lice-ridden blanket.\u201cAlso, the SS guards never shouted at us. I used to play table tennis with them.\u201dBut the counterfeiters were segregated from the thousands of other prisoners. Their windows were kept covered.Asked what he thought about his counterfeiting work, Mr. Burger told Mr. Morrison: \u201cI didn\u2019t think. I was in a concentration camp and I was ordered to do it. Print the money, so I printed it. If I hadn\u2019t done it, they would have shot me. We had no \u2018feelings.\u2019 \u201dAn estimated 130 million counterfeit British pounds were produced at Sachsenhausen. The Nazis wanted the prisoners to forge American dollars as well, to destabilize the United States economy. Mr. Burger recalled during a radio interview in Prague that another prisoner had wanted to drag out the counterfeiting of dollars but that their captors told them to proceed quickly or face a firing squad.The war was turning against Germany, however, and the dollar-counterfeiting scheme had not advanced far when the Nazis moved Operation Bernhard to the Mauthausen camp in Austria, where the prisoners expected to be killed. But in early May 1945, Allied troops liberated them. Mr. Burger was freed from the Ebensee forced-labor camp, part of the Mauthausen network.Along the way, fleeing Nazis had dumped crates of the counterfeit pounds. Some of them were discovered in 2000 beneath Lake Toplitz in the Austrian Alps.Mr. Burger, whose second wife died before him, had three daughters, according to Bernhard Rammerstorfer, who produced \u201cTaking the Stand.\u201dMr. Burger was devoted in later years to speaking about his experience, especially to students. His memoir, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Workshop,\u201d published in 1983 (an English translation was published in 2009), was turned into a film, \u201cThe Counterfeiters,\u201d directed by the Austrian filmmaker Stefan Ruzowitzky, with August Diehl playing the role of Mr. Burger.Advertisement"}

The gap was only 20 percent in 1980, and Ms. Yellen said, \u201cBeyond these advantages, research also shows that a college or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier and longer life.\u201dThe basic explanation is that less-educated workers are being replaced by machines and by less-expensive workers in other countries. Workers with college degrees are more valuable, more difficult to replace \u2014 and increasingly, they are the ones who operate the machines.\u201cIt concerns me, as it should concern all of us, that many are falling behind,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in the more sober section of her prepared remarks. \u201cFor those who do not attend college, we must find other ways to extend economic opportunity to everyone in America.\u201dThe overall unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, and other measures of the health of the labor market continue to improve. Importantly, there are signs of increased wage growth \u2014 including for younger workers, Ms. Yellen said, in keeping with the day\u2019s theme.Fed officials predicted last week they might raise rates three times in the coming year.For all of the Fed\u2019s efforts, growth remains lackluster, and Ms. Yellen acknowledged things could be better. \u201cChallenges do remain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy is growing more slowly than in past recoveries, and productivity growth, which is a major influence on wages, has been disappointing.\u201dMs. Yellen fortified her own credentials on Monday by accepting an honorary degree from the university.An earlier version of this article misstated the day of Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at the University of Baltimore.

My friend found this poster at a thrift store and gave it to me in 2006 when we were both living in Chicago. At the time, I was into self-help, especially the language of self-help and the messages. I still am, but back then I was even more into short-form aphorisms and that style of writing. I was always reading self-help books but was super self-aware about how seriously to take what I was reading.The word \u201cright\u201d is where it gets confusing. When I\u2019m working on something, even when I don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going, I have a sense of what I\u2019d like to make. So maybe doing things right is following that sense even when I stop trusting myself. The rightness is in the process, even if it doesn\u2019t match up with my plans.I\u2019m interested in the economy of words and forms: jokes, aphorisms, copywriting, advertising, that way of writing when meaning has to be squeezed into as few words as possible. A folky, vernacular way that ideas spread. It\u2019s a cultural thing, too, because if you look at aphorisms in different cultures, they\u2019re embedded with the thinking and ideas that are important to that culture, that local context.I especially think there\u2019s something representing Chicago in the phrase, \u201cQuality is doing it right the first time!\u201d that\u2019s very different from California or New York. It\u2019s an industrial city with a history of labor struggles, and the idea of working with efficiency is wrapped up in that. There\u2019s also this pride about doing something well and assurance that there is a right way. I\u2019m generalizing, obviously, but I live in Los Angeles now and Chicago feels much more like a place where there\u2019s a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things. You see that attitude even among artists \u2014 to put your head down and work, finish things, get it done. I read a Bill Murray interview, I think it was in Esquire, and he talks about this Chicago attitude. He says that in Chicago, you work on something together and then become friends, but people won\u2019t become friends first \u2014 you can only be friends if the thing you\u2019re working on comes out okay.It\u2019s a very Chicago way that I agree with, even if it isn\u2019t always reflective of who I am because I don\u2019t feel like I finish anything. When a piece of mine is \u201cfinished,\u201d I can still go back to it and rework it. I had a studio visitor ask me when a piece was complete and afterward, I realized I was kind of annoyed by the question. I wrote down to myself, \u201cNothing\u2019s ever finished\u201d as an operating value. It aligns with the idea of rightness \u2014 even in art the very question of completeness is driven by the market. When it\u2019s \u201cfinished,\u201d it can be sold, which is the main reason I\u2019m being asked that. Because otherwise, what difference does it make?Because of a transcription error, an earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly Martine Syms\u2019s comments about a quotation on a poster. She correctly noted that the poster says \u201cquality is doing it right the first time.\u201c She did not say \u201cquality is doing things right the first time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pay in Move vs. Income Inequality", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byMoving to address income inequality on a local level, the City Council in Portland, Ore., voted on Wednesday to impose a surtax on companies whose chief executives earn more than 100 times the median pay of their rank-and-file workers.The surcharge, which Portland officials said is the first in the nation linked to chief executives\u2019 pay, would be added to the city\u2019s business tax for those companies that exceed the pay threshold. Currently, roughly 550 companies that generate significant income on sales in Portland pay the business tax.Under the new rule, companies must pay an additional 10 percent in taxes if their chief executives receive compensation greater than 100 times the median pay of all their employees. Companies with pay ratios greater than 250 times the median will face a 25 percent surcharge.Portland\u2019s executive-pay surcharge will be levied as a percentage of what a company owes on the city\u2019s so-called business license tax, which has been in place since the 1970s. City officials estimated that the new tax would generate $2.5 million to $3.5 million a year for the city\u2019s general fund, which pays for basic public services such as housing and police and firefighter salaries.\u201cThis is certainly part of the solution,\u201d Mr. Piketty wrote in an email, \u201cbut the tax surcharge needs to be large enough; the threshold \u2018100 times\u2019 should be substantially lowered.\u201d\u201cWhen I first read about the idea of applying a higher tax rate to companies with extreme ratios of C.E.O. pay to typical worker pay, I thought it was a fascinating idea,\u201d Mr. Novick, a Democrat, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was the closest thing I\u2019d seen to a tax on inequality itself.\u201dMr. Novick, who lost a bid for re-election last month, said he had begun weighing such a tax about a year ago, but did not discuss it publicly until September.\u201cIncome inequality is real, it is a national problem and the federal government isn\u2019t doing anything about it,\u201d Mr. Hales, a Democrat, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe have a habit of trying things in Portland; maybe they\u2019re not perfect at the first iteration. But local action replicated around the country can start to make a difference.\u201dMr. Hales, who did not seek re-election, will leave office at the end of the month.Portland officials said other cities that charge business-income taxes, such as Columbus, Ohio, and Philadelphia, could easily create their own versions of the surcharge. Several state legislatures have recently considered bills structured to reward companies with narrower pay gaps between chief executives and workers. In 2014, a bill in California proposed reducing taxes for companies whose executives were paid less than 100 times above the median worker. The bill did not pass.\u201cWe see it as an empty gesture,\u201d said Sandra McDonough, the alliance\u2019s president and chief executive, in a telephone interview. \u201cWe think they\u2019d be far better off trying to work with business leaders to create more jobs that will lift people up and improve incomes.\u201d Publicly traded companies, she added, are \u201can easy group to pick on.\u201dMr. Hales conceded that the pay ratio is \u201can imperfect instrument\u201d with which to solve the problems of income inequality. \u201cBut it is a start.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Melcher, chief investment officer for the PNC Asset Management Group, a division of PNC, because interest rates are likely to increase, leading to higher consumer borrowing rates.\u201cAs the economy continues to expand,\u201d Mr. Melcher noted, \u201cit is likely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month or early next year. That will affect the Christmas index but not necessarily by much.\u201dThis year, there were wide fluctuations in the price of some products, based on the data that PNC gathered from retailers, hatcheries and dance companies.The true bargain in the gift package, the partridge price fell 20 percent, to $20, as a result of a larger supply of the game birds. Last year, the price soared because the partridge became a popular dish among foodies, but supply apparently met demand.The brood of imported hens, sometimes called faverolles because the breed was developed in the 1860s near the French villages of Houdan and Faverolles, came in at $181.50, the same price as 2015.Once called colly birds \u2014 an ancient term for blackbirds \u2014 they are ringing up at $599.96, the same as last year. Prices for these, and other birds, can swing from year to year.The price of gold rings held steady for the fourth year in a row. Even though gold commodity prices dipped earlier this year, they later evened out. (According to some, the reference to five golden rings in the classic carol might have actually been to five ring-necked pheasants \u2014 which would be more in keeping with the lineup of birds in the song.)The gaggle of geese remained at $360, holding steady from last year. Prices of the birds, sometimes associated with Christmas dinner, have varied, according to information PNC gathered from a waterfowl farm.As with the farm workers, the price tag for nine ladies dancing was static this year. The group (priced at a rate for professional modern or ballet dancers) was paid $7,552 this year, the same as 2015. Sorry, ballerinas \u2014 no raise in 2016.Male entertainers did not fare any better than their female counterparts this year. They were consigned to performing their athletic feats for the same price, $5,508, as in 2015. But compensation for their work has increased nearly continuously since 1984, when their performance ran about $1,600.The cost to have 11 of these lively wind-instrument players rose for the first time since 2013. It is up 2.8 percent from their previous level of $2,635, according to a Philadelphia union for musicians. Their pay began to get a boost in the early 2000s and has risen steadily since then.To have the dozen drummers at your true love\u2019s doorstep will cost some 2.8 percent more than last year. Compensation for the dozen drummers will be $2,934, their first raise in several years. No calculations were factored in to compensate the neighbors for noise complaints.The overall price tag soars, however, if the sender of the gifts believes that the song requires that the presents have to be added each time the verse is sung. The cost of all the items repeated in the song\u2019s verses means buying 364 gifts, and would put the giver out of pocket an eye-popping $156,507.Advertisement"}

Once the city\u2019s center of manufacturing, the neighborhood is now home to an expanding arts scene, with galleries galore alongside high-end boutiques and trendy restaurants.The district is already home to a handful of gleaming apartment and condo buildings, but it may soon get its most fanciful project yet.The project comes as city officials have vowed to radically transform the river, much of which has been sheathed in concrete for nearly a century.\u201cThe L.A. River was really the heart of Los Angeles, it\u2019s why downtown is located where it is,\u201d said Vince Bertoni, the director of planning for the city. \u201cWe turned our back to the river, we\u2019re trying to reverse that and really embrace it,\u201d he said.Mr. Ingels, considered a rising-star in the architecture world, said he sees the city \u201cembarking on a new kind of renaissance.\u201d\u201cThe Arts District is becoming a place that could become a walkable neighborhood and an enclave of urbanity in L.A.,\u201d he said.The project faces considerable hurdles before it can move forward. Because of its height and density, it would need several variances from the city\u2019s planning department, including permission to build residential units. And the variances may need to come before March, when voters will be asked to approve a measure that would impose a moratorium on new developments that require significant variances.Mr. Ingels bristled at the notion that the development would further gentrify the neighborhood.\u201cWe wanted to embrace and enhance the kind of architecture that is there, to build something with flexibility and the raw quality of manufacturing buildings,\u201d he said.Mr. Bertoni said the plans offered a \u201cvery good start\u201d to work with the existing fabric of the area.\u201cThe real key for us is not that there are too many shiny buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how do we design them in a way that keep the existing buildings that are distinct and offer the history to the neighborhood.\u201d\u2022 Sunday is Christmas.

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Mexico", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate22 PhotosA SEAFRONT VILLA WITH A POOL IN COZUMEL $1.5 MILLION This five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath house sits on a 0.43-acre beachfront lot in an enclave of four villas in Cozumel, an island in the Caribbean off the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. A private one-bedroom caretaker\u2019s cottage is at the driveway entrance. Behind the house, a cluster of palm trees provides a shady respite from the public beach beyond. The 5,395-square-foot house, built in 2004, is very close to the neighboring homes on both sides.From a thatched roof covering the two-car carport, steps lead up to the house. Known as Villa Las Glorias, it is of painted concrete block with a red barrel-tiled roof. The front terrace has a concrete water feature; the broad wood front door is inset with glass squares.The ceiling in the foyer is decorated with a backlit canopy of tree branches. Earth-tone ceramic tiles cover the floors throughout, and colorful abstract art adorns the walls. The house is being sold furnished, said Nancy Edwards, a broker at the Cozumel Living Real Estate Company, which has the listing. The rent is $4,000 a week, $6,000 a week at Christmas.From the foyer, three steps lead to a sunken living room with built-in sofas, a fireplace, a vaulted ceiling and sliding glass doors that open to a pool deck with sea views. The dining room, separated from the living room by a low wall, also has a sliding glass door to the deck.The kitchen, to the right of the foyer, has a colorful broken-tile mosaic countertop and breakfast bar, stainless steel appliances and a gas cooktop. The kitchen cabinet doors and the built-in cabinets in the bedrooms repeat the washboard-like branch motif. Light filters through glass blocks in the kitchen.Two bedrooms are on the first floor. One opens through a sliding door to the front terrace; the other opens to the pool. One bedroom has its own bath; there is also a powder room in the hall. All the bathrooms have navy and white Mexican ceramic tile.Upstairs, the master bedroom has a vaulted ceiling, a ceiling fan and a balcony with pool and sea views. The en-suite master bath has an enclosed toilet, a double vanity and a large skylit shower room with shower heads at each end. To the other side of the upstairs landing are two more bedrooms with en-suite baths and balconies. One faces the sea; the other has a thatched roof and faces the jungle.A circular staircase leads from the master bedroom to a roof deck with sea views.The concrete pool deck has a thatched roof for shade, an outdoor kitchen with a barbecue and an outdoor shower. The pool has a swimming section, a shallow lounging area and a plunge pool.Steps beyond the neighboring house in Cozumel\u2019s south hotel zone, a series of beach clubs draws day trippers from cruise ships with restaurants with beach service, bars, souvenir shops, swimming pools and inflatable water playgrounds. Jet Skis and other water sports equipment are also for rent. A supermarket and other shopping can be found along the coast road; tourist shops and restaurants abound in the downtown San Miguel area, about eight miles to the north.Cozumel International Airport is about 20 minutes away. Cozumel can also be reached by ferry from Playa del Carmen on the mainland. The trip takes about 45 minutes.MARKET OVERVIEWThe 2008 global economic downturn hit Cozumel hard, Ms. Edwards said. Real estate prices dropped about 35 percent, she said, but started to pick up about a year ago.The United States economy \u201cgreatly affects\u201d the Cozumel market, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s still a buyer\u2019s market, but it is rapidly changing.\u201dThe prices of condominiums typically range from $300,000 for a two-bedroom to $450,000 to $565,000 for a three-bedroom unit, Ms. Edwards said. Four houses recently on the market were priced at over $1 million, including one at $2 million with substantial property.Joseph Watts, the manager of Re/Max Complete in Cozumel, noted \u201ca sharp increase in sales\u201d this year, though he said it would \u201cprobably take more time for prices to go up, since there are still listings available from the slower period.\u201d The markets for homes and condos on the island are equally strong, but the number is limited \u201cbecause it is an island,\u201d Mr. Watts said.Mortgages are available but usually require a down payment of at least 40 percent, Mr. Watts said. WHO BUYS IN COZUMELMs. Edwards said that among her buyers, about a third are Mexican, a third are American and a third are Canadian. Buyers include large numbers of diving enthusiasts, snowbirds and expatriates.BUYING BASICSAs an island, all of Cozumel is in the Mexican government\u2019s restricted coastal zone, requiring foreigners to buy property through a property trust managed by a bank, said Gisela Rodriguez, a lawyer in Cozumel. Trusts, and any real estate transactions in Mexico, must be done by a notary public. In Mexico, notary publics are licensed lawyers appointed by the government and are impartial, Ms. Rodriguez said.Down payments are generally 10 percent of the purchase price, with closing about three months after an offer is accepted. A 3 percent transfer tax is charged on all real estate transactions.Closing costs, standard among notaries, are 1 percent of the purchase price, Ms. Rodriguez said. Bank fees, including the federal permission for which the bank applies on behalf of foreign buyers through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, costs $1,300.Because the notary is impartial, \u201cit is advisable\u201d for buyers to have their own lawyer, Ms. Rodriguez said, even before they make an offer on a property. The lawyer should check property records to make sure there is no lien; \u201csometimes the documents are not entirely in order,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. The lawyer can also investigate future capital gains taxes, which can run 35 percent for foreign sellers. A lawyer\u2019s fee of 1 percent of the purchase price is payable after closing and once the deed is registered.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish, Mexican peso (1 peso = 0.05 United States dollar)TAXES AND FEESThe property taxes on Villa Las Glorias are about $2,000 a year.Real estate commission, paid by the seller, ranges from 5 to 7 percent of the purchase price.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Trailers That Have Us Excited for 2017", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byA new year brings new movies, of course, but their promotion has already begun. With a full slate of films headed to the big screen in the next few months, here\u2019s a look at notable trailers.Otherwise, \u201cFifty Shades Darker\u201d seems to take everything people liked and loathed about \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d and double it. Meaningful glances are everywhere. Some scenes in the trailer are a little more suggestive, though there might be a public indecency law broken in one of them. Even the wooden dialogue is back. (Although perhaps more self-aware; the first line of the trailer, \u201cI want you back,\u201d feels like a plea from the producers.)Even the music is the same. The trailer for \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d was set to a slower, spookier remix of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy in Love.\u201d Not to be outdone, this trailer brings in the R&B star Miguel for a breathy, hauntingly sexy cover that\u2019s just distinct enough to merit notice.And hey, why not? The music worked last time.Not the trailer for \u201cLogan,\u201d released in October, which sweeps all mentions of X-Men or Wolverine under the rug.Instead, it suggests a post-apocalyptic western. Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of \u201cHurt,\u201d a song about pain, provides the through line, connecting all the shots of a weary, older Mr. Jackman. The once-invulnerable Logan is shown alone, backed by dusty deserts and rusting equipment. He\u2019s battered, bloodied and wizened. It\u2019s Wolverine, by way of Clint Eastwood.The trailer positions Logan as a Wild West outlaw, making a break from the superhero genre. When antagonists appear, they arrive in a caravan of police cars. One character even wears a cowboy hat and poncho. So by the time Logan finally unsheathes his claws, toward the trailer\u2019s end, it\u2019s a jarring tonal break from what seems like a quieter, smaller film.April 28After that, Mae attends a keynote address delivered by a Circle leader, played by Tom Hanks, who stands in front of the company logo and wears a dark sweater that looks like the love child of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s hoodies and Steve Jobs\u2019s classic turtlenecks. He speaks about the power of technology, luring us in with his \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d voice, while Mae and her colleagues attend meetings and take selfies. \u201cSharing is caring,\u201d they chant emphatically. It\u2019s a sharp contrast from a real-world discussion about whether that\u2019s actually true. (Oh, hey, don\u2019t forget to share this column on Facebook!)The dark turn is inevitable, even without our current conversation about technology in 2016. So the trailer adds to the drama with a slowed- and stripped-down cover of the Hall & Oates song \u201cPrivate Eyes.\u201d A voice chants over piano, \u201cThey\u2019re watching you,\u201d drawing audiences further in with a foreboding warning about both the story onscreen and what might be happening off.The \u201cSnatched\u201d trailer, released in December, finds the right balance. It\u2019s certainly joke-dense. From the start, it establishes Ms. Schumer\u2019s character in an embarrassing breakup scene that brings her comedy chops to the forefront. Then it zips along to her mother\u2019s home, where Ms. Hawn awkwardly comforts Ms. Schumer with a hug that immediately establishes the uneasiness in their relationship. The trailer ushers them to South America with a quick conversation that further explains who they are: a young woman trying to find herself and a mother mired in routine.As the trailer introduces more plot elements \u2014 a man, the titular snatching, the escape \u2014 it keeps the jokes coming with a remarkable narrative economy. Plus, it gives equal time to Ms. Schumer and Ms. Hawn, suggesting both women will be making memorable returns to the big screen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Strikes a Deal to Cut Carbon Emissions by Putting a Price on Them", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Friday that Canada would introduce nationwide carbon pricing in 2018.Mr. Trudeau worked out a deal for the plan, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by putting a price on them, after meeting with the premiers of Canada\u2019s 10 provinces and three territories.The leaders of two provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, refused to agree to the plan, but it will be imposed on them by the federal government.As expected, the conservative government in Saskatchewan balked at signing the agreement. Brad Wall, its premier, said that while his province planned to significantly reduce emissions, a carbon price would make its farms, mines and oil industry uncompetitive. On Friday he said that was now particularly true if the incoming administration of Donald J. Trump pulled the United States out of its carbon reduction commitments.\u201cLet\u2019s not be na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Wall said.Mr. Trudeau dismissed concerns about Canada being at an economic disadvantage relative to the United States.\u201cCanadian climate policies will be set by Canadians, not by whoever happens to be president of the United States,\u201d he said.\u201cRegardless of whether the next administration is as aggressive as we\u2019ve been, there\u2019s no way of turning back,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He added that policies that reduced carbon emissions in the United States were increasingly the work of state governments or, more frequently, business decisions.\u201cMany of the trends that have taken hold are no longer government-dependent, they\u2019re market-driven,\u201d Mr. Biden said.The other holdout province, Manitoba, was a surprise. It had previously announced plans to join Ontario and Quebec in a cap and trade system linked with California\u2019s.Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, appeared to be withholding his approval until the federal government agreed to a new formula to calculate financial support for the provinces\u2019 health care needs. Provincial governments operate the public health care system, but they rely on federal funds to do so. The level of those payments is a source of national discontent.When asked why he would not sign, Mr. Pallister, a conservative like Mr. Wall, cited a long list of health care issues in his province that he said require additional federal funding from Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government.Mr. Trudeau said earlier that the federal government would give the provinces the money raised by any federally imposed carbon taxes.Excluding the two holdout provinces, the agreement covers 93 percent of Canada\u2019s population. Mr. Trudeau said that 90 percent of Canada\u2019s energy needs would be met by \u201cclean\u201d sources by 2030.While environmentalists say that Canada must still expand its commitments, they generally praised Friday\u2019s announcement.\u201cToday establishes a new normal for Canada on the issue of climate change,\u201d Catherine Abreu, the executive director of Climate Action Network, an alliance of about 100 groups, said in a statement. \u201cFor the first time, we have a framework that brings the federal government, most provincial and territorial governments, and major sectors of our economy together on a shared path.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Trudeau\u2019s recent pipeline approvals, this climate plan would be a historic success,\u201d Alex Paterson, a campaigner with the Manitoba Energy Justice Coalition, said in a statement. \u201cWhen you put the recent pipeline approvals beside the climate plan it is clearly about allowing oil companies to profit for as long as possible.\u201dMr. Trudeau has long argued that it is possible to limit carbon emissions while also expanding Canada\u2019s energy sector, which is a significant part of its economy.Advertisement"}

A human. Then: \u201cA mammal.\u201dThe name my daughter carries with such easy pride in many ways tells the story of Europe\u2019s transformation from warring Continent to postnational laboratory of peace in which multiple identities, at least for some of us, have been happily layered.Mali is a Welsh name, a tribute to my husband\u2019s visceral Welshness. He grew up in Cardiff, the capital of Wales; went to a Welsh-speaking school; and still frets over every rugby game with England as if it were 1282 all over again and his plucky little nation was fighting subjugation by the English crown.Agnes is a name carried by several women in my German family, not least my paternal grandmother. One of her brothers was killed during a bombing mission to England in World War I, but she welcomed two English sons-in-law into her family after World War II.Grace is the family name handed down on my husband\u2019s paternal English side of the family.

My generation studied, dated, lived and worked across borders, taking for granted the peace our grandparents had fought for and our parents had harnessed and amplified.My mother marched for abortion rights in the 1970s, and my father was a leader in the 1968 student movement in Berlin that forced open the taboos about Germany\u2019s Nazi past. War is not an abstract concept to him. To this day, the firecrackers on New Year\u2019s Eve remind him of the bombs falling on Hamburg when he was 5 years old. When he reads about Aleppo, his eyes well up.The big debates of my youth centered on fine-tuning the market economy. Nationalism, nativism, fundamentalism and identity \u2014 these were concepts that belonged in the 20th century. Or so I thought. Will they now define my children\u2019s future? What will their names and their passports mean to them when they grow up?When we named our children we opted for my husband\u2019s surname, Grace. It had a nice ring to it, we thought. One European name was enough, and so, surely, was one European passport. All three children are British citizens.But as 2016 winds down, given Britain\u2019s decision to quit the European Union, I am applying for their German passports.When I married, I kept my own surname. I was 32 and had been a journalist for eight years. My name was my personal and professional identity. But when I traveled alone with my children, having a different last name from them sometimes raised questions. I eventually added my husband\u2019s last name to my passport, although I do not use it in everyday life.I now find myself wishing that I had given my children my last name as well. A double surname would have been unwieldy, but it would have been European instead of just British \u2014 and it would have signaled a connection to me.I come from a line of strong women. This, too, is something that has been on my mind this year: Did I let them down by not giving my children my own name?My paternal grandmother, who came from a family of Swabian aristocrats in southwestern Germany, studied medicine just as German women won the right to vote.But when she married my grandfather she had to give up her career, her noble title \u2014 and her name.My mother studied engineering in the 1960s. She was the first in her family to go to university and the only woman in her class. For a time, she cut her hair short and called herself \u201cMax.\u201d Being one of the boys, as she put it, kept the sexist jokes at bay. When she married my father, she paid five Deutschmarks for permission to hold a double name \u2014 with his name first.By the time I got married, in France in 2007, keeping my own name was the default setting on the paperwork.My daughters do not seem to think too much about their gender. One says she wants to become a doctor. The other one a firefighter. So far being female is not a factor in their aspirations.My older daughter, Elena, who is 7 and has been learning about world religions, recently came home from school and announced that she was Muslim. She took off her shoes, got to her knees and pressed her forehead to the kitchen floor (facing south, but no matter). This is how you pray, she explained.(Her sister, Mali, was so impressed that she promptly told the extended family. Asked whether he was Muslim, too, her 5-year-old Welsh cousin replied: \u201cNo. I\u2019m vegetarian.\u201d)Six months after the Brexit vote, my children\u2019s world remains effortlessly inclusive. We are all mammals. I speak German to them, their father Welsh. Ask them where they are from and they will tell you \u201cBrixton,\u201d our bustling colorful neighborhood in south London. Their friends\u2019 parents are Portuguese, Indian, Catalan, Ethiopian, Nigerian and occasionally even English.But the mood in Britain is changing. And in subtle ways it is changing even at our school, which is in a part of London that overwhelmingly voted to remain in the European Union. This year, an email from the head teacher went around, asking parents to refrain from discussing Brexit in the yard. Passions were running high among some parents.The children, though, are mostly unaware of how the world is turning upside down around them. When my husband explained that many Britons wanted to leave Europe, our older daughter was baffled. \u201cWhere do they want to go?\u201d she asked. \u201cAfrica?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Record-Setting Year in City Home Sales", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe Manhattan real estate market reached new heights once again in 2016.Apartments sold at record prices, on average, while sales at recent residential developments outpaced last year\u2019s brisk volume.But the market also showed signs of slowing down, particularly in the ultraluxury sector, where units like those at 432 Park Avenue are taking longer to sell and discounts are becoming more common. An increase in inventory, from new developments and resellers still hoping to cash out big, is partly responsible. Another contributing factor is the absence of the pent-up demand that lingered after the recession, when construction came to a near halt.\u201cThe current contract prices reflect the new market,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cnot the one established several years ago,\u201d when many new high-rises were little more than holes in the ground.But he and others are optimistic about New York\u2019s housing market going into the new year. While certain buyers can afford to be more choosy because they have more options, he noted, demand remains strong. In some circles, there is even talk of an eventual undersupply of inventory (beyond what\u2019s already happening in the market\u2019s lower end), as the city\u2019s population continues to grow.Higher-priced homes are taking considerably longer to sell. The median number of days that properties $9.5 million and higher spent on the market was 187 as of November, 37 more than last year, said Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist of Realtor.com. The median time on the market for all Manhattan properties so far this year, he said, was 87 days.About 1,800 new-development sales are expected to be recorded at year\u2019s end by CityRealty\u2019s calculations, compared with 1,464 in 2015. The average unit price at these developments: a record $4.9 million, up from the previous record of $4.8 million, set in 2014.There was a flurry of closed sales at this slender concrete-and-glass skyscraper on Billionaires\u2019 Row, between 56th and 57th Streets. The tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, topping out at 1,396 feet, this Rafael Vi\u00f1oly-designed building has helped redraw the city\u2019s skyline.\u201cWe are negotiating \u2014 we want to sell apartments,\u201d Mr. Wallgren said, adding that about three-quarters of the building\u2019s 104 units have sold or are under contract. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had significant price increases over two to three years, so there\u2019s plenty of room to be negotiating.\u201dEven so, he added, \u201cBecause of our strong financial footing, there\u2019s no urgency at all. By the end of next year, it\u2019ll be sold out.\u201dNearly all the top sales this year were in condominiums.Co-op apartments generally sell for less than condos, but three co-ops with Central Park views closed above $30 million.Market watchers are predicting few changes in the new year, although interest rates are edging up.\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be that much of a difference between this year and next,\u201d Mr. Miller, the appraiser, said. \u201cThe local economy here is strong, and that\u2019s been an important driver.\u201dHe and others say they have observed a slight uptick in sales activity since the election, which may carry into next year.CityRealty\u2019s year-end report predicts that average prices for Manhattan apartments will remain about the same, though it forecasts a slight dip in average condo prices, to $2.9 million from $3.1 million this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andrew Puzder Is the Wrong Choice for Labor Secretary", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialHere is the record at those restaurants. When the Obama Labor Department looked at thousands of complaints involving fast-food workers, it found labor law violations in 60 percent of the investigations at Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, usually for failure to pay the minimum wage or time and a half for overtime.The central problem for workers today is persistently low pay, even at profitable companies with highly paid executives. Mr. Puzder, however, has been adamantly opposed to a meaningful increase in the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour. Mr. Trump has said he could stomach an increase to $10, which is still abysmal. Ideally, a labor secretary, who is supposed to have a deeper understanding of this issue, would push for much more. But Mr. Puzder has said that a big raise would mean fewer jobs for workers starting out. Even if that was true, and the evidence suggests otherwise, there are millions more who would benefit from raising the minimum wage.Mr. Puzder has also been a scathing critic of efforts by the Obama administration to update the rules for overtime-pay eligibility, which have not been fully adjusted for inflation since the mid-1970s. His argument boils down to an assertion that employees prefer a low salary and the \u201cprestige\u201d of a managerial title \u2014 even though they would be entitled to overtime if they remained hourly employees. His opposition to the new overtime rules is especially troubling given that it would be his task as labor secretary to defend the rules, which have been challenged in court.Mandatory sick leave has been criticized by Mr. Puzder as well. He says it would be an undue burden on businesses. Yet in all other advanced economies, paid sick days, paid parental leave and similar policies are rightly seen as investments in human capital, as necessary as investments in plants and equipment.For Mr. Puzder, being pro-business seems to mean being anti-worker. That makes him the wrong choice for labor secretary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Firm Quits Brazil Hotel Project That Was Named in Criminal Inquiry", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe prosecutor is looking into a broad range of investments across Brazil, questioning whether public pension fund managers in the country were paid bribes to invest money in commercial projects.A spokeswoman for Trump Hotels said in a statement that the decision to pull out of the Rio hotel project was made because of problems in completing the 13-story, 171-room luxury property. It was opened for the Rio Olympics in August before several floors and facilities were finished, including a 4,000-square-foot nightclub.\u201cUnfortunately, the developers of the Rio de Janeiro hotel are significantly behind on the completion of the property, and their vision for the hotel no longer aligns with the Trump Hotels brand,\u201d said Jennifer Rodstrom, the spokeswoman for Trump Hotels.In the United States, one federal agency, the Office of Government Ethics, has said that Mr. Trump must divest from his properties to eliminate potential conflicts.On Wednesday, House Democrats issued a letter suggesting that the General Services Administration \u2014 which essentially serves as the landlord for the federal government \u2014 had concluded that Mr. Trump would breach the lease that his company has to operate a hotel in a federally-owned building on Pennsylvania Avenue the moment he is sworn in.But shortly after the Democrats issued their letter on Wednesday, the agency said that it had not yet reached such a conclusion.\u201cWe can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,\u201d a spokeswoman for the agency, Ashley Nash-Hahn, said in a statement.A decision on this question, she added, will not likely come until Mr. Trump takes office.Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a federal prosecutor in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, opened the criminal inquiry in October, identifying $40 million in investments in the hotel made by two small Brazilian pension funds. One invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm; the other manages the pensions for civil servants in Tocantins State.In legal filings, Mr. Lopes said that he was examining why the two pension funds invested so much of their capital in the venture, positioning his inquiry within a broader federal investigation of graft at Brazil\u2019s pension funds, pillars of the economy that have been involved in an array of scandals in recent years.As part of the same investigation, Mr. Lopes is also focusing on the Trump Towers Rio, a project to build five futuristic office towers in downtown Rio that was announced in 2012 in conjunction with MRP, a Bulgarian real estate company. Unlike the Trump Hotel Rio, the partners in the downtown venture have not started construction.Mr. Lopes is examining whether the Trump Organization and MRP illegally benefited from support for the office-tower complex from a huge public bank, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal.LSH Barra, the owner of the Trump Hotel Rio, did not respond to requests to comment on the decision by the Trump Organization to pull out of the venture. In a recent statement, LSH said that it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the pension fund investments, and that it was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.Mr. Figueiredo Filho, who spearheaded the venture until recently, is now living in the United States.In a statement, he said he found out about the split with the Trump Organization on Tuesday, adding that he respected the decision and currently did not take part in management decisions for the hotel.\u201cMy admiration for Donald Trump, with whom I share so many ideas and whom I enthusiastically supported during the campaign, has not changed one millimeter,\u201d said Mr. Figueiredo Filho.It remains unclear what will happen to the hotel, which was conceived as a linchpin of Rio\u2019s overhaul for the Olympics. Parts of the futuristic beachfront property, which was the Trump Hotel Collection\u2019s first property in South America, still resemble a construction site, despite the hotel\u2019s inauguration months ago.Eric Lipton contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Hopes for European Unity Dim, New E.U. Headquarters Are Glowing", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 A giant glowing orb is about to become the new home of the European Union.Nestled inside of a bold and decidedly quirky new building, the orb will be visible from the street during the day and after dark, a nod to greater transparency by an institution often dismissed as elitist and remote.When European leaders meet for the first time in their new headquarters, known as the Europa and built for about 325 million euros, or $340 million, they will experience \u201cjoyful\u201d surroundings, Philippe Samyn, the project\u2019s architect, said during a recent tour of the building.It has been a long time since any gathering of the bloc\u2019s leaders could be described as joyful.Finishing touches are being applied to the orb \u2014 on close inspection it\u2019s really more of a vase \u2014 just as hopes of European unity have faded precipitously.Britain voted in June to leave the bloc, and the willingness of the other 27 member states to play by rules decided in Brussels is being tested in ways scarcely imaginable when the project was given the go-ahead a dozen years ago. Europe is being swept by populist fury, much of it directed at the European Union \u2014 at its centralizing tendencies and its often ineffectual results.National leaders have failed repeatedly to reach consensus over how to manage the debt crisis in Greece that nearly sank the euro several years ago. They still are quarreling over how to handle a mass influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa. That crisis could resume if a delicate deal with Turkey restraining the flow collapses.At best, the new building might represent a fresh start for the European Union, along with its architecturally charmless neighborhood, known as the European Quarter. At worst, European leaders might end up meeting in their eye-catching new headquarters just as they reach the nadir in the struggle to determine the future of their troubled Continent.The Europa features bespoke touches like dazzlingly colored carpets woven from New Zealand wool and designed by a Belgian artist, and a meticulously restored hallway from a previous building on the site, which once served as the headquarters for the German occupying forces during World War II.The cost of the new building is galling for member states like Greece that have endured years of punishing austerity measures in exchange for loans to rescue their economies and maintain public services. It also angered David Cameron, who resigned as the British prime minister after Britain voted to exit the bloc. He had campaigned to keep Britain in a reformed European Union.\u201cYou do wonder whether these institutions actually get what every country, what every member of the public, is having to go through as we cut budgets and try to make our finances add up,\u201d Mr. Cameron said five years ago, after being briefed on plans for the Europa.Ministers will move next month, and European Union leaders are expected to hold their first meeting there in March.The leaders gathered two weeks ago for their year-end summit meeting in the Justus Lipsius building, an unloved venue that has been used since the 1990s. Named for a 16th-century Flemish stoic, the building evokes a postwar vogue for architectural Brutalism. Its interior is a matrix of dim hallways and soulless conference rooms.The new project, next door, was conceived to improve the quality of meeting space in anticipation of bigger gatherings as a result of an enlargement of the bloc in 2004, when 10 nations, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, joined.A huge conference space was later added to the plan to enable European leaders to convene international delegations.The glowing central structure is intended to serve as a kind of \u201clantern\u201d for Europe, said Mr. Samyn, the Belgian architect, who explained that engineering challenges had shaped his design choices.Mr. Samyn said that some essential elements of his design \u2014 a tiered structure that curves outward from a narrow base \u2014 came to him in a dream.At its widest point, the orb has enough room for 330 delegates and 32 interpretation booths. Where it curves in at the top and bottom there are smaller conference rooms, dining areas and space for members of the news media.Mr. Samyn festooned the structure with white strips to reflect low energy spotlights that make it glow after dark, even when no meetings are taking place.A cube-shaped, see-through facade that encases the orb serves as a visual hymn to the European Union\u2019s motto, \u201cUnited in diversity,\u201d Mr. Samyn said. The facade\u2019s 3,750 panes of extra-clear glass have been mounted in refurbished oak window frames of different sizes, which were obtained from demolition sites in each member state.The meeting rooms are laid with carpets and have ceiling coverings in 60 different colors, producing a mildly psychedelic effect. The square and rectangles motif, designed by Georges Meurant, a Belgian artist, acknowledges the importance of color to national identity while avoiding patterns that recall any individual member state\u2019s flag.The bloc\u2019s leaders will sit at a round table rather than the one with sharp angles that is currently in use in the Justus Lipsius. That means they will no longer need to use video monitors some of the time to see who is speaking, making the atmosphere more intimate, Mr. Samyn said.A less welcome reason for the increased intimacy: One fewer leader will be at meetings once Britain carries out its plan to depart.With far-right, anti-bloc politicians in France and the Netherlands riding high in the polls ahead of elections in 2017, there is widespread speculation that Britain\u2019s departure may be the start of a great unraveling of the European Union.For the first time in its history, the bloc\u2019s survival is being openly discussed. Unsurprisingly, the gloom that has descended on Brussels has given rise to a form of black humor, much of it directed at the Europa building. Among the quips: Rather than serving as a lantern, as Mr. Samyn has called his gently curving structure, it could one day be used as a giant funeral urn, to hold the ashes of a collapsed European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Americans Experiencing Collective Trauma?", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byGray MatterWe\u2019re all familiar with the notion of psychological trauma \u2014 damage to an individual\u2019s psyche caused by an extremely distressing event. But there\u2019s also another kind of trauma: a collective disturbance that happens to a group of people when their world is suddenly upended.Consider the Buffalo Creek flood of 1972. In Buffalo Creek, a mountain hollow in West Virginia, a coal-mining company had deposited more than a million gallons of wastewater and sludge, checked by a rudimentary dam. Rain caused water levels to rise, and on Feb. 26, the dam burst. An enormous wall of thick black waste came barreling down the hollow, destroying one mining hamlet after another. Homes, churches, roads \u2014 everything was swept away. One hundred and twenty-five people were killed.Visiting the area the following year, the sociologist Kai Erikson found the survivors psychologically traumatized. Residents grieved for lost family members and friends. Many relived the event in flashbacks.But Mr. Erikson noticed \u201ccollective trauma\u201d as well. As he documented in his 1976 book about Buffalo Creek, \u201cEverything in Its Path,\u201d the floodwaters carried away not just physical objects but also relationships and routines that had defined life there for generations. Without these social anchors, residents struggled to find meaning and purpose. They were disoriented and disconnected in ways that could outlast even the effects of their individual psychological traumas. Socially, they were in a permanent state of shock.The concept of collective trauma was rooted in the thought of \u00c9mile Durkheim, a turn-of-the-20th-century French sociologist and an architect of the field. Durkheim argued that norms, values and rituals were the linchpins of social order; they provided the basis for solidarity and social cohesion. Collective trauma occurs when an unexpected event severs the ties that bind community members to one another.In a paper on the Polish transition out of Communism, the sociologist Piotr Sztompka has shown that changes in labor market conditions are ripe for producing collective trauma. Although the revolution of 1989 was a liberation, Polish workers were used to a planned economy. Many were unprepared for the spikes in unemployment, price shocks and heightened competition in the workplace that accompanied market reforms. Family life and friendships suffered. The trauma was registered in anxiety about the future, a nostalgic yearning for the Communist past and a decline in social trust.As we\u2019re seeing in the United States, mass job loss itself can be damaging to a collectivity. In 1960, 24 percent of American workers held jobs in manufacturing. Today that number stands at 8 percent. Manufacturing jobs offered workers without college degrees \u2014 men especially \u2014 wages high enough that they could support their families. But factories and mills were more than sources of income. They were local institutions. People built relationships and organized their lives around them.As factories closed or were automated, the social structure of working-class towns and neighborhoods was undercut. Men who used to be role models found themselves out of work. Many took low-wage service sector jobs they perceived as demeaning. Drug and alcohol use rose. There was talk about how things had changed for the worse. This was the realization that a social world was gone.Last month\u2019s presidential election has collective trauma written all over it. For working-class white people whose communities had been hollowed out by the decline of manufacturing, the rhetoric and promises of Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign offered a salve. He vowed to restore the world they had lost.But those who voted for Hillary Clinton may now be experiencing collective trauma of their own. In the aftermath of the election, they have been walking around in a daze. Some of this is because forecasts based on problematic polling strongly predicted a Democratic win. Some is fear or uncertainty about the future. But there\u2019s more to it than that: For progressives, moderates and \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans, the political order they long took for granted \u2014 defined by polarization, yes, but also by a commitment to basic principles of democracy and decency \u2014 is suddenly gone.In recent decades, Democrats and Republicans rarely agreed on substance, but all candidates for major office were expected to adhere to fundamental ethical norms, like \u201cdon\u2019t threaten to jail your opponent\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t celebrate sexual assault.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s victory signals that that world, with the assurances it offered that there were some lines those seeking power wouldn\u2019t cross (or that the American electorate wouldn\u2019t let them cross), is no longer. Rightly or wrongly, memories have been activated of historical traumas linked with anti-democratic politics, such as the emergence of fascism in interwar Europe and the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.The title of Mr. Eyerman\u2019s book about Katrina \u2014 \u201cIs This America?\u201d \u2014 is a question many have been asking lately. It\u2019s a telltale sign of collective trauma, a grasping for identity when the usual bases for community aren\u2019t there anymore. If research on other collective traumas is any indication, it may take years, and a great deal of political imagination, for us to figure out where to go from here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Villagers Are Baffled by Flocking Chinese Tourists", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byKidlington JournalKIDLINGTON, England \u2014 The Chinese visitors fanned out of a tour bus, and suddenly stopped, transfixed, as if marveling at the Venus de Milo or the Eiffel Tower. Then they began photographing an unremarkable 1970s suburban home, an oak tree, a rosebush and a garbage bin.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Liu Jingwen of Guangdong Province said as one of her travel companions crouched with his camera on the edge of a lawn and took a selfie in front of a small red brick bungalow. A porcelain schnauzer smiled from a nearby window. An angry passer-by yelled: \u201cNo photos! We\u2019ll call the police!\u201dThe sudden influx of Chinese has also grabbed headlines and spawned a national mystery.Why, for example, do the Chinese tourists ignore the village\u2019s handsome 13th-century church and its thatched-roof cottages, preferring instead to peer through windows, film parked cars and traipse on the lawns of Benmead Road, a humdrum and modern residential street? One tourist asked a stunned resident if he could help mow her lawn. (She politely declined.) Another jumped joyously on a child\u2019s trampoline in the front yard.Others suggested that the Chinese had been drawn by Kidlington\u2019s claim to being one of the largest villages in the realm. Or perhaps they wanted to see the Kidlington mansion previously occupied by Richard Branson, the shaggy-haired billionaire?Ask a Kidlington resident why anyone, nevermind someone from as far away as China, would want to come here, and you will be invariably greeted with a look of dumbfounded amazement.\u201cWhy the Chinese come here is one of those unfathomables,\u201d said Liam King, 73, a telephone engineer who was raking leaves in front of his house on Benmead Road.\u201cThere is nothing wow-wow here,\u201d added Sanjay Aslam, 43, a driver, noting that Kidlington had long lived in the shadow of Oxford University.\u201cIt\u2019s just a regular village, quite a nice place, no riffraff walking around,\u201d offered Polly Bonney, a hairdresser.Kidlington has had its moments. A history of the village notes that in 1937 three Siberian wolves escaped from the local zoo, causing great panic. And in 1987, the chairman of the parish council touched off a revolt when he tried to turn the village into a town.The consensus at the pub was that the Chinese guests had unintentionally helped the anonymous village gain international attention, and were good for the local economy. Ms. McGrath said Chinese tourists occasionally entered the pub, ordered Guinness, pulled a face and left. \u201cThe Chinese have put us on the map,\u201d she said.In point of fact, there is a perfectly logical explanation for why droves of Chinese tourists are coming to Kidlington, and it is hardly going to burnish the local reputation.He added that some wily tourists had figured out that buying tickets at the palace would cost only about $25, and were secretly sneaking there on foot, irking other tourists, who had already paid full price. As a result, he said, those who opted out of the Blenheim tour were being dropped in Kidlington, which is not within walking distance.Mr. Sun stressed that the Kidlington phenomenon was also an outgrowth of modern China and globalization. Many tourists are a part of China\u2019s rapidly growing middle class, many of whom live in anonymous concrete tower blocks in huge cities, he said. They are enchanted by the village\u2019s tranquillity and intrigued by daily life in the English countryside.\u201cThe environment in the countryside in China isn\u2019t so great,\u201d he said, noting that it could be run-down and gritty compared with England\u2019s typically bucolic atmosphere. \u201cIn Kidlington, the environment is great. You see farm fields and ranches here. Also, many newly built houses here have brick or brick-and-wood structures, which you no longer see very often in urban China.\u201dAs a tourist bus pulled out of town, a group of Chinese visitors waved from their windows, smiling widely. The Kidlington tour had lasted about 15 minutes, but that was more than enough for Ms. Liu.\u201cIt\u2019s so romantic,\u201d she said, looking dreamy eyed. Then the bus sped away.Vanessa Piao contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect.The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America\u2019s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015.In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection.Muro enlarged on his findings in an email:These industries encompass the nation\u2019s \u201ctech\u201d sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country\u2019s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth.The importance of these industries does not stop there:The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It\u2019s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people \u2014 those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they\u2019re going to make ends meet.Ellison\u2019s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial.In other words, as Muro made clear in his email:shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties.From 2009 to October 2016, Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm pro-trade stance, 48-37, 11 points in favor, to a decisively pro-trade position, 56-31. The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders.Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24.If anything, Trump\u2019s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade.This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas \u2014 in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.Among Democrats during this same period, Putin\u2019s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62.An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails.In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years.Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month.Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email,the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains.In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact \u2014 shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped.Although Trump\u2019s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters.Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party\u2019s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective.An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, \u201cRecent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,\u201d shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off.The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call \u201cskill downsizing.\u201d Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained.Despite Trump\u2019s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes \u2014 imports plus exports \u2014 have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent.Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreementsare not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they\u2019re about setting expansive \u201crules of the road\u201d that determine who wins and who loses.The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process:With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the \u2018winners\u2019 under these rules.Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party\u2019s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies \u2014 including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing.Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status.The nation\u2019s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks \u2014 and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation\u2019s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Abuses of Young Refugees in Denmark Reflect Perils Across Europe", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byLANGELAND, Denmark \u2014 The first of the asylum seekers, five shy African boys, arrived in July 2014, just days after the authorities on this small Danish island were granted permission to open a shelter for children.Local organizers hurriedly opened as many as 20 shelters housing more than 3,200 refugees, an act that blended humanitarian generosity with an economic lift for the poor community, as the new shelters drew millions in government subsidies.But it was too much, too fast. Two years later, Langeland\u2019s network of shelters has been riddled with problems and abuses, including arson, fights, rape and sexual molestation.\u201cAcross Europe, child protection systems are failing children on the move,\u201d Sarah Crowe, a spokeswoman for Unicef in Geneva, said when reached by telephone. \u201cThere is an assumption that everything is under control when they arrive on the European shores, \u201cbut it\u2019s actually just the beginning of a new phase of their journey.\u201d\u201cIn parts of Germany, some of the centers for families are not suitable for children,\u201d Ms. Crowe said. \u201cThey fall victim to violence and abuse and the staff lacks proper training. We are working to harmonize the standards.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s Criminal Intelligence Agency, Europol, said in January that at least 10,000 unaccompanied minors had gone missing after arriving in Europe.Presumably, they have fallen through the cracks of the asylum systems of various countries, or reunited with family or friends, but what exactly has become of many of them remains a mystery.The lesson of Langeland, some now concede, is that caring for vulnerable child migrants and refugees fleeing conflicts in places like Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea requires special skills that many staff members at asylum centers do not have.On Langeland, two employees at a center in the village of Tulleboelle are charged with having sexual intercourse with minors \u2014 akin to statutory rape in the United States \u2014 and having engaged in other sex acts with seven young refugees, ages 16 to 18.At a different center, Praestekaergaard, also operated by the Langeland municipality, as many as 12 refugee children may have been victims of sexual abuse by other refugee children. The abuses happened last year, but did not become public until this November.Today, Ulrik Pihl, who ran the asylum program, has been relieved of his duties, after criticism that he did not inform the Danish Immigration Service of the episodes, even after they were reported to the police.In November, the government announced that Langeland and another municipality would be barred from hosting unaccompanied minors in the future.\u201cI very clearly want to dissociate myself from the abuse,\u201d Mr. Pihl said in an interview. He regretted not promptly informing the authorities, but insisted the problems were unavoidable.\u201cI don\u2019t think we could have prevented it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything in the police records of those employees.\u201dYet Mr. Pihl acknowledged that, facing high numbers of new arrivals and many new centers in a hectic period of fast growth, he had no time to educate staff members.\u201cA large part of the staff had a background in pedagogy, but none had practical experience of this sort at all,\u201d Mr. Pihl said, recalling the difficulty of finding qualified people.\u201cOf course, I thought to myself, What on earth did we agree to?\u201d he added. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t for a moment think we wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\u201dRather, Mr. Pihl said the city council sensed opportunity when it agreed to quickly expand the number of shelters, hoping that the influx of migrants could stimulate the local economy.Before the refugees arrived, Langeland, home to about 12,500 people and 130 miles from Copenhagen, was burdened by a lack of jobs and a steady bleeding away of its population to other parts of the country. That changed when the refugee numbers grew.\u201cThe unemployment rate in Langeland dropped from 8 percent to 4, and there\u2019s one reason for that: the asylum centers,\u201d Mr. Pihl said.In 2011, Langeland hosted one asylum center, for families, with 29 employees. By April of this year, the centers had grown into a full-fledged department that employed 358 people and had a turnover of 300 million Danish crowns (about $43 million).But for the municipality, it proved to be too much to handle, particularly when it came to unaccompanied, war-damaged minors demanding special care that Langeland could not immediately offer.\u201cCaring for children with trauma is not a common thing in a peaceful country like Denmark,\u201d Kuno Soerensen, a psychologist from Save the Children, said when reached by phone.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have staff with the necessary skills, and that\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he added.A memorandum from the municipality on the episodes at the Praestekaergaard center acknowledged that the facility had \u201cway too few staff,\u201d but added that more funding had arrived from the Danish Immigration Service to address that.Government documents obtained by Denmark\u2019s Radio24syv revealed that the national Immigration Service had received repeated warnings from the Danish Refugee Council, a nongovernmental group, of mistreatment of children by staff members as early as December 2014.The warnings cited suicidal tendencies among some children, and said that staff members had awakened children by spraying cold water on them or by removing a mattress from underneath them. But the warnings were followed up by just a single phone call to the Langeland municipality, the documents said. Last week, the government said it is going to strengthen the supervision of asylum centers.On a recent afternoon, the only light burning in the offices of Langeland\u2019s town hall was that of Kurt Habekost, the recently appointed temporary asylum director.\u201cI\u2019ll concede that we\u2019ve been too slow on the uptake,\u201d he said, referring to the training of staff members at the shelters. \u201cBut when you establish a center in 48 hours, it\u2019s going to take some time to educate the staff.\u201d\u201cPerhaps we should have paid more attention with the children\u2019s facilities,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut recruiting is difficult because most people know it\u2019s a temporary job.\u201dWith the troubles, and fewer asylum seekers arriving in Europe now, eight of Langeland\u2019s centers have closed, seven will close in the coming months, and 82 staff members have been dismissed.Still, Mr. Pihl defends the overall achievements of Langeland\u2019s asylum centers.\u201cWe have an agile organization and can open a children\u2019s center in three days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can manage the administration to pay salaries, hand out the pocket money and feed the asylum seekers. We\u2019ve streamlined those processes and become a model for other operators.\u201d\u201cThere is no such thing as a thornless rose,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen Denmark nationally hosts 20,000 asylum seekers there will be fires, fights, rape and crime, because that would also be the case among 20,000 Danes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is set to go before the full Council early next year.Parts of the proposal have pleased business owners who have traditionally been wary about what legalized sidewalk vending would mean for them.

{"Headline": "Vale of Brazil Sells Fertilizer Business to Mosaic for $2.5 Billion", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The Brazilian mining giant Vale has reached an agreement to sell much of its fertilizer assets to the Mosaic Company of the United States in a deal worth $2.5 billion, the companies said on Monday.The deal will help Vale reduce its debt, a major problem plaguing many Brazilian companies struggling with a prolonged recession and a weaker local currency. Earlier this year, Vale\u2019s chief executive, Murilo Ferreira, said he wanted to reduce the company\u2019s debt by $10 billion.At the same time, it gives Vale an important minority stake in Mosaic and the growing global fertilizer business.For Mosaic, which is based in Plymouth, Minn., the acquisition gives it a foothold in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, which boasts a strong agriculture sector.Mosaic\u2019s chief executive, James C. O\u2019Rourke, said in a conference call on Monday that he was drawn to the deal in part because \u201cBrazil\u2019s farm economy has grown at remarkable rates over the past two decades and that growth continues today.\u201dThat is even though the country continues to face political and economic upheaval.As part of the deal, Mosaic will acquire Vale\u2019s phosphate assets in Brazil, excluding those in Cubat\u00e3o; its potash assets in Brazil; the Kronau potash project in Canada; and its shareholding position in Bay\u00f3var, Peru. A Rio Colorado potash project will also be included after due diligence, the companies said.The transaction is a combination of stock and cash. Half of the $2.5 billion will be in cash, while Mosaic will issue roughly 42.3 million shares of common stock.The purchase price represents a multiple of 5.4 times the assets\u2019 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2015, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.\u201cWe have always said that we look for value-adding opportunities at the low points in the cycle, and that is what we have found here,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who is known as Joc.Vale stands to earn an additional $260 million if certain objectives are met over the two years following the close of the deal. The company will also gain the right to appoint two members to Mosaic\u2019s board of directors, one of whom is to be independent.The companies expect the deal, which requires approval from CADE, Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator, to be completed in late 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Meet Your Next Attorney General", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.No one saw it coming.When Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday appointed Xavier Becerra, the Democratic congressman from Los Angeles, to fill the soon-to-be-vacant position of California attorney general, the move roiled the state\u2019s political establishment. (Much of the speculation had centered around the possibility that Mr. Brown would choose his wife and close adviser, Anne Gust Brown, to replace Kamala Harris, the attorney general who was just elected to the United States Senate.)\u201cMost insiders believed he wanted to move back to California, so all in all it was a pretty elegant political play,\u201d said Peter Ragone, a political consultant in San Francisco who is advising Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor who is running for governor in 2018.But the appointment shakes up a Democratic political world that had already been girding for fundamental changes as its three most senior elected officials, all of whom are over 70 \u2014 Mr. Brown, Senator Barbara Boxer and Senator Dianne Feinstein \u2014 prepare to exit from the scene. Mr. Becerra joins a very crowded list of Democrats angling for some of those jobs. And now he has the advantage of a perch, the office of attorney general, that historically has afforded its occupant a lot of exposure.Mr. Becerra, 58, will now be one of the highest-ranking Latino officials in the state at a time when California is gearing up for clashes with President-elect Donald J. Trump on immigration. He could run for attorney general again and make a career out of that. But he now has a platform that will allow him to run for governor, or for that matter senator.But not too soon.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s viable to get appointed and then quit immediately to run for something else, but he will run for something else down the road,\u201d Mr. Ragone said.See a pothole in San Diego? There\u2019s an app for that.After six months of operation, we checked in with city officials to see how it\u2019s going.About half of those reports have been resolved, either fixed or determined to be a nonissue, he said. The rest were referred to other agencies, like a utility company, or remain open.The most common complaint? Graffiti, followed by potholes and broken streetlights.According to Mr. Udrys, the fix time has averaged around 10 days, but longer in the case of a big repair like a bent traffic light pole.The city refers those reports to the agencies, but whether they get addressed is anyone\u2019s guess, some users said.What\u2019s more, for residents uninterested in downloading yet another app, San Diego does not offer the convenient 311 phone reporting system used in other cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.Mr. Udrys said San Diego hoped to introduce one in the \u201cnext few years.\u201dKarl Decker, 38, said he used the app to report a curb that needed a fresh coat of red paint outside his house.

{"Headline": "Black Workers\u2019 Suit Accuses Job Agency of Favoring Hispanic Applicants", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byA group of African-American workers filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday against a nationwide job placement agency and several of its clients, accusing them of discriminating against black applicants by favoring Hispanic applicants.The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that the agency, MVP Staffing, used a range of discriminatory practices, including code words for job applicants of different races, to honor the requests of corporate clients who refused to employ African-Americans in temporary positions. The company operates about 60 offices in 38 states.The suit accuses the company of eight counts of racial discrimination based on the operations of its office in Cicero, Ill. A phone message and an email seeking comment from MVP Staffing on Monday night were not returned, and a person who answered the phone on Tuesday declined to comment.The other companies named in the suit are also in the Chicago area. They are Personnel Staffing Group, the Segerdahl Group, Mercury Plastics Inc., Jet Lithocolor, The Penray Companies Inc., WestRock Consumer Packaging Group, AGI Media, Lawrence Foods Inc. and the Blommer Chocolate Company.Representatives at Mercury, Personnel and WestRock declined to comment on Tuesday; the others did not respond to requests.Joe Sellers, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he believed that racial discrimination was widespread in the staffing industry, which connects job seekers with employment that is often temporary.\u201cWhat we have seen in this industry is that this is a more widespread phenomenon than what we have just found in this case, with this company,\u201d Mr. Sellers said. \u201cThe staffing agencies follow the requests made by the client companies even if they happen to be ones that might exclude people based on race.\u201dMr. Sellers said there were several other anti-discrimination class-action lawsuits in process against staffing agencies and their client companies in Illinois. The agencies \u201cdo the bidding of the employers on whose behalf they are reviewing candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a process readily susceptible to abuse.\u201dCatherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel for the National Employment Law Project, said the discriminatory practices alleged at staffing agencies were \u201ca microcosm of the problem that\u2019s happening across our economy.\u201d\u201cCompanies have figured out that if they outsource their recruiting and hiring, and what\u2019s often considered to be the messy parts of their H.R. function, that they can then absolve themselves of any liability,\u201d Ms. Ruckelshaus said. That hits low-wage minority workers the hardest because of \u201centrenched and persistent discrimination,\u201d she said.Kevin James, 29, one of the named plaintiffs in the suit, said he had applied for work through MVP on roughly 20 occasions but had been given a job only once. He sat in the MVP office waiting in vain while Hispanic applicants got assignments, he said.On the one occasion when Mr. James was given a job, he said, he was sent to a packaging company where supervisors were hostile toward him, \u201chovering\u201d over him and other black employees as they worked.\u201cIt just seemed like a lot of tension, like they didn\u2019t really want me to be there,\u201d Mr. James said. He added that the staff of the MVP office in Cicero \u201cwas mainly Mexicans\u201d and that the employees were not welcoming toward African-American job seekers.\u201cI\u2019d say the whole staff was Mexican,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like the whole thing was built up mainly around Hispanics.\"Rosa Ceja, 29, a former dispatcher at MVP\u2019s office in Elmwood Park, Ill., said the company used a system of code words in an attempt to conceal its preferential treatment of Hispanics. She said her work often took her to the Cicero office, where the same system was in place.Ms. Ceja said MVP employees referred to African-American and white job applicants as \u201cguapos,\u201d which means \u201chandsome ones\u201d in Spanish, and to Hispanics as \u201cfeos,\u201d or \u201cugly ones.\u201d\u201cThey said African-Americans wanted to keep their hands clean and not get dirty and not work as hard as a Mexican \u2014 that\u2019s why they called them guapos,\u201d she said. MVP employees were told that using the words \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cMexican\u201d instead of the code words, especially in an email, was a fireable offense.The code words were in Spanish because \u201call of the managers\u201d who refused to hire African-Americans were Hispanic, Ms. Ceja said. Some would try to conceal their request by saying they wanted only employees who listened to 107.9 FM, a Spanish-language radio station in the Chicago area. \u201cThat was a code word for us to only send Mexicans,\u201d she said.The vast majority of Hispanic job applicants served by MVP were in the United States illegally, Ms. Ceja added, and their vulnerability made them attractive short-term workers. \u201cThat makes it harder for them to complain or do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are so scared to raise their voice and say, \u2018Hey, this is not fair.\u2019\u201dMs. Ceja said MVP employees would start the day by separating Hispanic job applicants from African-Americans. They would enter the Hispanic applicants\u2019 contact information into a database so they could be easily reached when jobs opened up. African-American applicants rarely received the same treatment, she said: They were usually instructed to go to an MVP office at dawn to wait for assignments that rarely came.When African-Americans were given jobs, they were often marked \u201cD.N.R.\u201d when they returned, short for \u201cdo not return\u201d to the client company, Ms. Ceja said. Dispatchers who sent African-Americans to a company that had asked not to be sent black employees would be reprimanded by their boss, she added.\u201cIf it was 10 Mexicans that would come at 1:30 p.m., and 25 African-Americans that were there at 4:30 a.m. and were waiting to be sent to work, they would send the Mexicans first,\u201d she said.Jonah Engel Bromwich and Caitlin Dickerson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, the Fed and You", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byTaking NoteIf you think of the economy as a car, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision today to raise the benchmark interest rate is its way of applying the brake.In general, the Fed hits the brakes when it sees signs of rising inflation. But the Fed\u2019s forecasts for inflation, also released today, are virtually unchanged from September. Nevertheless, it raised its rate, from a range between 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent to a range between 0.5 percent and 0.75 percent.But the election of Donald Trump has led to a burst of inflationary signals. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has sparked a stock market rally \u2013 essentially, inflation in asset prices \u2013 as investors anticipate deregulation and business tax cuts. It has also raised expectations of future inflation, as investors anticipate a shot of fiscal stimulus, mainly from a huge, regressive cut in personal income and estate taxes.For now, the Fed\u2019s forecasts suggest it does not believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will have as big an impact on the economy as the markets seem to think. Nevertheless, it is the Fed\u2019s job to plan ahead. Even before the election of Mr. Trump, it was edging toward a decision to raise rates based on steady job growth and pay raises. The Trump-induced rally in the past month may have sealed the decision.That does not bode well for the working people who voted for Mr. Trump. It implies that interest-rate increases may occur sooner and be steeper than they otherwise would have been, which would likely slow growth in jobs and pay.Meanwhile, the tax cut Mr. Trump has proposed would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans, not working people. The latest version of his plan to spend federal money on infrastructure is also based on tax cuts for wealthy investors, which would blunt the job-growth potential of such spending.And those problems might only be the beginning. In the not-so-distant past, deregulation combined with tax cuts for the wealthy inflated the mortgage bubble, worsened income inequality and precipitated the Great Recession, which left working people economically marooned even as wealthy Americans recovered their losses and ascended to new heights.No one yet knows what Mr. Trump and Congress will actually do. What is known is that the Fed\u2019s take on conditions persuaded it to raise rates today, even though higher rates are bad for employment. If the Fed has other considerations in mind, it is not saying. But one possibility is this: A rate increase now will create room to lower rates later if needed to stabilize the economy in the event of a downturn. The Fed is ever vigilant of the specter of inflation ahead, but that specter could turn out to be something else.Teresa Tritch is a member of the editorial board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Enters a Transition Phase, Complex but Familiar, as Its Premier Quits", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 For once, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi doesn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry.Elections might be most satisfying for a restive public, except that an electoral law approved last year is under court review and may now be obsolete after Sunday\u2019s referendum.For Italians who keep insisting they are hungry for change, Monday\u2019s vote had the effect of ushering in an Italian Groundhog Day.\u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing,\u201d said Massimo Franco, a political columnist at the Corriere della Sera newspaper who said the transition toward new elections would probably last at least eight months but as long as a year and a half. \u201cItalians aren\u2019t shocked.\u201dInstead, Italians found themselves drafting another political autopsy report, this time to understand what did Mr. Renzi in. Some pointed to a sluggish economy that failed to deliver the jobs and prosperity he promised. Others spoke about their sincere disagreements with Mr. Renzi\u2019s constitutional overhaul. Many attributed Mr. Renzi\u2019s downfall to haughtiness, and to tying his political fate to that of the referendum. And just about everyone agreed that a strong anti-establishment wave had washed Mr. Renzi out.Yet anointing the Five Star Movement as Italy\u2019s next power overlooks the complexities of Italian politics. To overthrow Mr. Renzi, the Five Star Movement made common cause with other parties aligned with the Italian establishment, including lifelong officeholders and others such as former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, as well as leftist leaders and recipients of public benefits and labor protections.But now that Mr. Renzi is out of the way, those powerful interests of the left, right and center appear poised to return to business as usual, dividing power among themselves and probably shutting out the Five Star Movement, which refuses, per its party\u2019s purity laws, to form political alliances.\u201cThey think they won but they are actually the losers,\u201d said Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political scientist at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome who has advised Mr. Renzi on changing election laws. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make alliances. They are stuck.\u201dThis summer, as he was already campaigning to pass the constitutional changes, Mr. Renzi noted the irony of Italy\u2019s populists campaigning against him. \u201cParadoxically, if the Five Star Movement wanted to govern, it would be in their interest to vote for this reform,\u201d Mr. Renzi said in an interview. \u201cBut they like to say \u2018No.\u2019\u201dFor months, Five Star leaders excoriated the so-called Italicum, the electoral law Mr. Renzi had passed to bring more stability for Italian governments. It created a runoff system between national candidates that awarded the winner a bonus of seats in the lower house of Parliament. Those extra seats gave the electoral winner a parliamentary majority and essentially ensured a full, collapse-proof term.But the electoral law was intended to complement the constitutional changes on Sunday\u2019s ballot, which would have streamlined Italy\u2019s Parliament by reducing the power and size of the Senate. Now that the constitutional changes have been defeated, the new electoral law is also moot.Before Sunday, Mr. Grillo and other members of his party called Mr. Renzi\u2019s electoral law, now also under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court, an invitation to dictatorship. But immediately after Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat, Mr. Grillo had changed his mind.\u201cThe fastest, most realistic and concrete thing to do is immediately hold a vote with the law that already exists, the Italicum,\u201d Mr. Grillo wrote on his blog, while acknowledging \u201cwe\u2019ve always criticized this law.\u201dHow leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.The more likely option now, according to several analysts here, is that Mr. Mattarella would form a new coalition government most likely led by a member of Mr. Renzi\u2019s cabinet. On Monday, a few names began to surface as possible successors to Mr. Renzi, including his finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan; his culture minister Dario Franceschini; or Pietro Grasso, president of the Senate.It has been a long time since Italy has directly elected its leader. Mr. Renzi came to power in an internal party coup in 2014. Mr. Franco, the columnist, argued that part of the reason so many Italians turned out to reject Mr. Renzi\u2019s reform was that they believed it was his attempt to use the constitutional overhaul to \u201ccancel the original sin that he wasn\u2019t elected.\u201dThe last time the country directly chose its prime minister was in 2008, when it voted for Mr. Berlusconi.Mr. Mattarella will almost surely demand that the caretaker government he appoints reconcile the electoral law before he sets a date for early elections.When that time comes, Mr. Renzi could very well return to power. He lost 60 percent of the vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum \u2014 yet that \u2018No\u2019 vote belongs to many parties, not just one. Mr. Renzi showed that the other 40 percent of Italians are either behind him or his reform agenda. For now, Mr. Renzi\u2019s immediate fight, should he choose to remain relevant, is to retain his position as leader of his Democratic Party.\u201cIt would be more destabilizing if he steps down as party leader than as prime minister,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alimonte said.That all seemed very far away on Monday night. Hours after delivering a concession speech that is all but unheard-of in Italy, complete with congratulations to the victors, tears and odes to a spouse and children, Mr. Renzi\u2019s sedan slipped into the president\u2019s residence.In Mr. Mattarella\u2019s private study, the president asked about Mr. Renzi\u2019s children and then turned to the question at hand, with Mr. Renzi offering his resignation. After an efficient, half-hour meeting, Mr. Renzi left with his resignation, for now, deferred.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Hertz Chief Faces a Tough Road", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe new Hertz Global chief executive, Kathryn Marinello, faces a tough drive out of the ditch. She has a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The problem is that she is the $2 billion rental car outfit\u2019s third boss in two years \u2014 and the activist investor Carl C. Icahn is in the back seat, fidgeting with a 35 percent stake. Moreover, the company\u2019s engine is sputtering, despite her predecessor\u2019s attempts to get it firing more smoothly.The outgoing boss, John Tague, took over in late 2014 with Mr. Icahn\u2019s backing. The former United Airlines executive\u2019s overhaul included spinning off the equipment rental division this year.His latest, and last, set of quarterly earnings was a wreck, though. Last month, the company missed estimates for the third quarter by a mile and cut full-year guidance by one-third as it admitted it bought too many compact cars and had not achieved cost-cutting goals. In an ominous message for his successor, Mr. Tague told investors he had \u201cunderestimated the depth and the breadth and the complexity of the transformation\u201d he had undertaken.Ms. Marinello can draw upon an early career in banking, a decade running various General Electric businesses including auto-related financial units, and experience as a chief executive. She also has a view into other parts of the car business as a board member of both General Motors and the truck maker AB Volvo.That should afford her some insight into the effects of new technology on the Hertz business, like driverless cars, ride-hailing or other developments. G.M., after all, has a stake in and a car rental agreement with the ride-hailing upstart Lyft.In an effort to get on the bandwagon, Mr. Tague struck agreements with both Lyft and the market leader Uber over the summer. But Hertz\u2019s problems show how app-driven rides and the sharing economy in general are undermining its traditional rental model.The disruption has left Ms. Marinello with financial matters to deal with. Hertz\u2019s debt ratio has increased to 4.8 times the pruned estimates for this year\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, according to Morgan Stanley. Its rival Avis, by contrast, has a relatively safe 3.4 multiple.Mr. Icahn expressed his support for the new chief\u2019s appointment. He liked Mr. Tague, too, however. Ms. Marinello\u2019s journey could be a stressful one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Taps Peter Navarro, Vocal Critic of China, for New Trade Post", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday named a strident China critic, Peter Navarro, to lead a new White House office overseeing American trade and industrial policy, in the latest sign that Mr. Trump is moving to reshape relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Mr. Trump also said the billionaire investor Carl Icahn would serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues, another area of economic policy in which the president-elect wants big changes.The appointments reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s ambition to increase economic growth by hammering at what he regards as critical roadblocks. He has promised to expand American manufacturing by reducing federal regulation and by preventing what he has described as unfair competition from Chinese manufacturers. The choices of Mr. Navarro and Mr. Icahn also reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s manifest preference for advisers who are loyal, and who do not have government experience.Mr. Trump has said he will persuade Beijing to change its policies by applying pressure, including designating China a currency manipulator; enforcing existing trade laws more vigorously; and, if necessary, imposing a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. In a statement, Mr. Trump described Mr. Navarro as \u201ca visionary economist\u201d and said he would \u201cdevelop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores.\u201dA wide range of economists have warned that curtailing trade with China would damage the American economy, forcing consumers to pay higher prices for goods and services. Experts on manufacturing also doubt that the government can significantly increase factory employment, noting that mechanization is the major reason fewer people are working in factories.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Trump has also promised to edit the federal rule book, removing what he has described as overly burdensome restrictions. He said last month that the government would eliminate two regulations for each new rule it put on the books. For Mr. Icahn, who will not draw a salary, the new role formalizes his relationship with Mr. Trump, whom he advised on economic issues throughout the campaign. Mr. Icahn, 80, has no experience in government; like a growing number of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees, he was prized for his success as a businessman.Mr. Icahn, a brash New York billionaire who vocally supported Mr. Trump during the campaign, made his fortune as a \u201ccorporate raider,\u201d buying stakes in corporations and demanding changes to reward shareholders. \u201cCarl was with me from the beginning, and with his being one of the world\u2019s great businessmen, that was something I truly appreciated,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cHis help on the strangling regulations that our country is faced with will be invaluable.\u201dMr. Icahn will also play a role in the selection of a new chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator that serves as the referee for his battles with corporations.Mr. Icahn, the child of two New York schoolteachers, was not known for political activism before the 2016 campaign, and he has insisted that he wants to help the country, not himself. But Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of a major corporate investor to play a role in rewriting regulations that could affect those companies renewed concerns about conflicts of interest in the next administration.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.\u201cThe corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated,\u201d Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement about Mr. Icahn\u2019s appointment. \u201cVoters who wanted Trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud.\u201dMr. Navarro has built a quiet career as an academic economist, publishing papers on subjects like why businesses give to charity, electricity deregulation and the economics of trash collection.He also mounted four unsuccessful political campaigns as a Democrat between 1992 and 2001, including candidacies for mayor of San Diego and a House seat in Congress.He has said that he started paying attention to China in the early 2000s because he noticed that graduates of the business school at California, Irvine, were starting to lose jobs as a result of globalization. In 2011, he wrote a letter to Mr. Trump about his book \u201cDeath by China,\u201d which the movie was based on, and the men began to correspond. Over the past year, Mr. Navarro became an increasingly important campaign adviser on economic issues. But he and Mr. Trump had not met in person until September.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Blocks Mine Planned Near Boundary Waters in Minnesota", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byThe Obama administration on Thursday blocked development of a copper and nickel mine near a popular wilderness area in northern Minnesota, saying the project could poison the vast web of lakes, streams and wetlands that crosshatch the region.The company, Twin Metals Minnesota, sued the government in federal court in September, anticipating a possible rejection and arguing that it had an absolute right to the lease renewals. Twin Metals, a subsidiary of Antofagasta of Chile, one of the world\u2019s largest mining firms, has said it had planned to invest more than $5 billion in building the mine.It was not clear whether the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed to eliminate regulations that hinder economic development, would try to reverse the decision.Most of the Boundary Waters area has no roads, and motor craft are prohibited on many of its waters, so travel is done by foot and canoe. It attracts about 150,000 visitors a year.In 1966, the government granted two mineral leases, covering less than 5,000 acres in the national forest near the town of Ely, just outside the Boundary Waters. The leaseholders, later acquired by Twin Metals, did not develop a mine, and the government agreed several times to renew the lease. The company grew serious about pursuing the project, but the most recent lease expired in 2014, and the Obama administration delayed renewal for more study.On Thursday, the government informed Twin Metals that the Forest Service opposed the leases, and so the Bureau of Land Management, which controls mineral rights, was refusing to renew them.In addition, the Forest Service asked the Bureau of Land Management to ban mining for up to 20 years on 234,000 acres of the national forest, including the land that was covered by the leases. The bureau said it would block any mineral extraction for the next two years, while studying whether to impose a longer ban.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason that the Boundary Waters is one of the most-visited wilderness area in America: it\u2019s an incredible place,\u201d Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. \u201cThis is the right action to take to avoid irrevocably damaging this watershed and its recreation-based economy.\u201dTwin Metals has said its tests show that acidic drainage from its mine is unlikely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Taiwan and China: The Controversy, Explained", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWhen President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwan\u2019s president on Friday, he was wading into one of Asia\u2019s longest-running and sensitive issues: the dispute between Taiwan and mainland China.Both players claimed, at least formally, to represent all of China \u2014 which they considered to include each other\u2019s territory. That created problems, including periodic risks of war, for decades.The disagreement dates to 1927, when civil war broke out in the Republic of China. The war culminated in Communist revolutionaries, led by Mao Zedong, mostly defeating China\u2019s Nationalist government in 1949.But the Nationalist leaders fled to Taiwan, which their forces still controlled. Though fighting eventually stopped, both sides continued to claim all of China. The Taiwan-based government considered mainland China to be controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels. The Beijing-based government considered Taiwan a breakaway province.In this sense, the civil war was never fully resolved. Thus, Taiwan\u2019s formal name is still the Republic of China. Mainland China \u2014 controlled by the Communist government in Beijing \u2014 is called the People\u2019s Republic of China.Their dispute became a global Cold War issue. The Soviet Union and its allies recognized Beijing as China\u2019s rightful government, while the United States and its allies recognized the Nationalists in Taiwan. The Taiwan government even held the United Nations seat for all of China.In the 1970s, the world began accepting the reality of a divided China. Beijing took over the United Nations seat in 1971. President Richard M. Nixon traveled to mainland China the next year. In 1979, America switched its recognition from the Taiwan government to Beijing\u2019s. Many other countries followed suit.Since then, no American president or president-elect is believed to have spoken with a Taiwanese president \u2014 until the phone call on Friday.This would be extremely difficult for either government.The Beijing government has never given up hope of reintegrating Taiwan. Territorial integrity is an existential issue for all countries, but it is especially sensitive for Beijing, which fears emboldening separatism in Tibet and other regions.The Taiwan government is constrained on both sides. It cannot offer to reintegrate with the mainland, as the island is a democracy and Taiwanese people would be unwilling to surrender their freedoms. At the same time, Beijing has credibly threatened war should Taiwan declare independence. Taiwan cannot formally drop its claim to mainland China, because it would be seen as tantamount to declaring independence.This led, in 1992, to a semiofficial arrangement: Both countries agreed that there is only one China, encompassing the mainland and Taiwan. But they also agreed to disagree about what that means.Beijing is adamant about upholding this policy because it carries the promise of reunification. But in Taiwan, it has been controversial. Some prefer warm ties with their fellow Chinese and have sought to bolster trade. Others, particularly younger voters, distrust Beijing.Some Taiwanese leaders have questioned the current arrangement, including President Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected this year. She has promised to uphold the status quo but stopped short of endorsing the 1992 understanding \u2014 exacerbating Beijing\u2019s fears that Taiwan could declare independence.Mr. Trump, by speaking with Ms. Tsai on the phone and referring to her as \u201cthe President of Taiwan\u201d in a Twitter post, indulged those fears \u2014 and upended the traditional American stance, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy.Because both Taiwan and Beijing claim the same territory, foreign states cannot recognize both. Beijing forces countries to choose, as the policy\u2019s name indicates, \u201cone China.\u201d Nearly all countries have chosen Beijing, which controls the world\u2019s second-largest economy.The United States has a particular kind of One China policy, meant to accomplish three main goals: keep positive relations with Beijing, with which the United States has a host of agreements and interests; protect and assist Taiwan, a fellow democracy; and prevent the outbreak of war.Though the United States officially broke off relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains a nonprofit center known as the American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as a barely unofficial embassy. The United States has also worked to promote Taiwan\u2019s democracy and has sold it advanced military equipment, though these sales have declined in recent years.In this way, the United States is able to deny Taiwan recognition, yet also ensure it is strong enough to remain functionally independent. The policy should not be mistaken as a favor or handout to Beijing. Rather, it is intended to maintain American interests in both mainland China and Taiwan and prevent instability or war.As the United States has come to play a crucial balancing role, both sides have scrutinized any hint of change in the American position. In 1995, Washington broke with practice by granting a visa to Taiwan\u2019s president. Beijing considered this a possible step toward recognition of Taiwanese independence and, in response, fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait. The United States, in turn, placed two aircraft carrier groups nearby.Though the crisis ended peacefully, it underscored the United States\u2019 role in maintaining stability and the risk or war.The call does not in itself change policy, but it implies the possibility of a shift, forcing both China and Taiwan to guess at Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions.Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, by categorizing his call with Ms. Tsai of Taiwan alongside calls with other heads of state, implied that Mr. Trump recognized her as the leader of a sovereign state. Mr. Trump also wrote on Twitter that he had spoken to the \u201cPresident of Taiwan.\u201dRecognizing Ms. Tsai as a sovereign leader would communicate that the United States considered Taiwan an independent nation.Such a position would force both Taiwan and Beijing into a difficult choice. Either ignore American policy on the issue \u2014 perhaps ending the decades-long American role in balancing cross-strait relations \u2014 or confront Taiwanese independence, which Beijing has said would provoke war.Both Beijing and Taiwan have played down the phone call, suggesting that they would prefer to see Mr. Trump\u2019s words as a mistake rather than a deliberate policy shift.Still, Mr. Trump has retained some advisers who advocate more fully siding with the democratic Taiwan over the authoritarian China, perhaps even granting the former partial or full recognition.China and Taiwan, preparing for potential changes in America\u2019s policy, must ask whether the call hints at a coming change, or at least at the possibility that hard-liners on Mr. Trump\u2019s team could steer policy in radically new directions. If they are unsure, prudence would seem to require at least preparing for the possibility of a shift.Many Americans might reasonably wonder about this question, which Mr. Trump raised in a Twitter post in defense of the phone call.United States arms sales to Taiwan have indeed been controversial, particularly with Beijing. But they are an approach intended to maintain the status quo.By selling Taiwan arms, the United States ensures that the island can deter an invasion from the mainland\u2019s far larger military. This maintains a balance of power that, while fragile, is intended to prevent war.Granting Taiwan\u2019s leader informal recognition, or even an unofficial upgrade in ties, is different because it disturbs the status quo.To be fair to Mr. Trump, past presidents have adjusted the level of support for Taiwan, for example by increasing or reducing arms sales. But those policy shifts typically came with an explanation, so that China and Taiwan understood American intentions and knew what was and was not changing.What is different is that Mr. Trump has not made clear whether or not he intends to end America\u2019s 37-year-old policy on Taiwan and China. The fact of the phone call implies that he does intend to do so, but the possibility that he erred implies that maybe he does not.In this way, the issue is not that he caused offense or broke with tradition, but rather that he introduced real uncertainty about how the United States will approach this issue under his leadership.In international relations, especially on tense issues, a lack of clarity or predictability can be destabilizing because it forces all states to plan for the worst.The American policy on Taiwan and China is already ambiguous by design. In 2004, when asked about the One China policy, a senior State Department official told a congressional hearing, \u201cI didn\u2019t really define it, and I\u2019m not sure I very easily could define it.\u201dWhile the policy may be tough to articulate, it has at least been predictable. Mr. Trump, intentionally or not, has added a layer of ambiguity that is wholly new.Advertisement"}
