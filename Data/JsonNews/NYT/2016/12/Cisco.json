{"Headline": "Why the Computing Cloud Will Keep Growing and Growing", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, along with a couple of his rivals, may eventually control much of the $1 trillion global market for business computers and software.It\u2019s the same story at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, the other two big cloud companies. Start-ups and giant corporations rent the core resources, along with related software, instead of owning and running their own machines.What\u2019s next? As innovations like artificial intelligence and connected devices become popular, customers are putting cloud components in mobile computing, home games and email marketing campaigns. In other words, the big clouds aim to be everywhere.\u201cWhen has Amazon ever thought about anything other than world domination?\u201d said Lydia Leong, who follows cloud computing at Gartner. Not content to be in big centralized data centers, she said, \u201cthey want to be at the edges, whether that is a customer\u2019s own computers or the Internet of Things.\u201dThis aim for domination was clear at Amazon\u2019s big customer conference, called Re:Invent, which was held in Las Vegas this month. About 32,000 people went to the fourth annual event.In one talk at the conference, an Amazon Web Services executive showed off the company\u2019s 8,700-mile undersea cable, part of an A.W.S. global network that each day adds computing power equal to that inside a Fortune 500 corporation, and spoke about this expansion. He talked about crushing the costs of servers and networking, most likely sad news for old tech giants that make those things, like Dell and Cisco.In a nice bit of showmanship during the main keynote, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., appeared onstage with an 18-wheel truck carrying a device that could suck 100 petabytes of data out of a customer\u2019s computers and put it in the Amazon cloud. That is equal to two billion filing cabinets of paper, which a surprising number of companies now possess in digital form, thanks to things like video and sensors.Put that together with some software Mr. Jassy talked about that would be on chips made by Intel but capable of gaining access to the A.W.S. cloud, and you get the picture: There isn\u2019t a part of computing Amazon doesn\u2019t want to touch.Amazon says it is hardly moving away from a core business of providing large-scale computing, but rather finding more ways to sell stuff related to it by moving to edge devices.\u201cWe see it less as a move from one to the other, and more of an extension,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Camarata, wrote in an email Saturday. \u201cWe have an enormous number of customers excited about leveraging the capabilities.\u201dMachine learning \u2014 a method for computers to gain knowledge without being programmed with that information \u2014 is front and center for Alphabet\u2019s Google, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, the head of technical infrastructure at Google Compute. Google has recently shown off its own global network of submarine cables, along with local devices like cloud-connected office whiteboards. Over the next year, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said, Google will open about one new Compute facility a month.Building out across the globe, with sometimes $1 billion or more in a facility, is critical in some cases to meet local data regulations. Equally, the big cloud companies all want to be as close to customers and their devices as possible.\u201cGlobal proximity is a huge advantage,\u201d said Corey Sanders, the director of program management at Azure. \u201cThis is a way to transform your business, including the way devices on the edge act.\u201dThere are profound consequences from the scale and ambition of this trend. Given their size, wealth and technical expertise, the big cloud companies are likely to build cheaper designs and demand lower prices for everything in computing. Who is to say they don\u2019t affect the devices themselves?That is starting to dawn on the rest of the industry. On the first day of Re:Invent, Mr. Jassy had a private lunch with about 10 venture capitalists. It is an annual affair, where he indicates where A.W.S. is going, and they figure out how to make money from it.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t explicit, but if you were hoping to invest in storage, computing \u2014 anything below applications \u2014 you are hosed,\u201d said Dharmesh Thakker, a partner at Battery Ventures, who attended the lunch. \u201cAndy is smart and approachable, but reading between the lines, I\u2019m not sure this is good for the V.C. ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Donald Trump\u2019s Corporate \u2018Tax Holiday\u2019 Create Jobs? Not Necessarily", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has said he would like to create a \u201ctax holiday\u201d so that American companies can bring back profit that was generated overseas at a lower rate. In his view, this influx of cash will create jobs.But corporate boards and executives may have different ideas.They are likely to use much of the estimated $2 trillion held overseas to acquire businesses in the United States, to buy back their own stock or to pay down debt, say advisers of America\u2019s top corporate executives.Merger bankers \u201care sharpening their pencils with what types of deals those larger companies can look at,\u201d said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of mergers and acquisitions in the Americas for the Swiss bank UBS. \u201cI think M.&A. will be fairly high on the list.\u201dAmerican corporations have kept an accumulation of earnings abroad because they would be subject to paying more taxes when they bring it home.If they were to bring that capital back, those companies could use it to invest in their businesses, which may in turn create jobs. Yet that is only one of several options.If the priority turns out to be deals, that would be good news for investment bankers who generate fees from large advisory assignments. It would be less so for American workers who might get laid off as a result of cost cuts derived from combining two companies.Some of those cuts were tied to mergers and acquisitions. As part of the study, Oracle explained how its repatriated funds were used for two acquisitions: Retek, a software provider to the retail industry, and PeopleSoft, a rival in enterprise software. After buying both for a combined $11 billion, Oracle \u201celiminated thousands of jobs,\u201d the study found.Today, bankers are rearranging their chess boards, trying to figure out which companies may want to make moves, and which ones might be ripe for the taking. That has kept the bankers in technology and health care busy. Some of the top companies on everyone\u2019s watch list include Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), Amgen, Apple, Cisco, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.Yet at the moment, the potential for tax reform in 2017 has led some companies to delay deal making, according to Marc Zenner, the co-head of J.P. Morgan\u2019s corporate finance advisory team.\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got right now is a fair bit of uncertainty about what the state of the world will be next year with taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to do this deal right now, maybe you can wait until next year so you can finance optimally.\u201dStill, some boards appear to believe they may get a better price if they sign a desired deal sooner rather than later. If tax rates decrease, a company\u2019s profitability increases, making it a more expensive acquisition target. And, if all of the repatriating companies go after the same targets, that could drive up the price as well.\u201cWhat people fear is that if everyone waits for clarity on timing and specific tax treatment, the markets could be a lot higher, purely as it relates to this influx of capital,\u201d Peter A. Weinberg, founding partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, said. \u201cDo you commit capital today with the risk of timing, or do you wait for certainty and risk paying more than you would today?\u201dMr. Weinberg said that if there were a significant reduction of the tax rate, companies would bring at least $1 trillion back, an amount large enough to affect the prices of equities and debt.Some companies may not be interested in deal making. Apple, which has the largest overseas cash load, is historically not a big acquirer; its largest purchase was its $3 billion deal for Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014. Microsoft, with the second-largest cash hoard, will most likely still be digesting its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, announced in June.But these companies will not get away with simply letting the cash sit on their balance sheet unused for too long.\u201cIf the money is coming back, it would be hard to tell investors, \u2018I have access to it and you\u2019re not getting it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zenner said.A certain class of hedge funds, known as activist investors, have been known to screen for companies with large piles of cash relative to their market valuations. They take large stakes and then push management to use the money for stock buybacks or richer dividends.During the 2004 tax holiday, stock repurchases were a forbidden use of the cash, but that rule proved difficult to enforce. A 2009 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that each dollar of repatriated cash was linked to an increase of 60 to 92 cents in some form of payout to shareholders.There are far more activist investors with billions more in capital to deploy this time. While activists\u2019 assets under management declined slightly this year, they still amount to about $175 billion, 50 percent higher than just four years ago, according to data compiled by the research firm Activist Insight.It is unclear exactly how tax reform under Mr. Trump might look, but many on Wall Street are optimistic about what it means for their clients.\u201cThe potential for these reforms, around reduced corporate tax rates and cash repatriation, to put more discretionary cash flow in the hands of companies is significant,\u201d said Avinash Mehrotra, co-head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s M.&A. shareholder advisory group. \u201cBoards and management teams will have some interesting choices around acquisitions, longer-term capital investments, debt reduction and return of capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It mobilized its technology for his defeat and warned of dire consequences if he should somehow win.Now that the impossible has happened, tech\u2019s day of reckoning is here \u2014 next Wednesday afternoon, to be precise. The president-elect is summoning leaders of the biggest tech companies to New York for a round-table discussion, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The agenda is undisclosed and perhaps still under consideration, but it is unlikely to produce the sort of love fest that existed between President Obama and Silicon Valley. Tech culture celebrates disruption as the tool that produces a better future for all. Many of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters, on the other hand, see it as pushing them down.Two Silicon Valley chief executives appeared willing to test the waters: Safra Catz, of the software maker Oracle, confirmed her participation in next week\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump. So did Chuck Robbins of Cisco Systems, the networking gear maker.Representatives for other leading tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple, declined to comment. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel has said in interviews that the benefits accruing to tech investors like himself should be more widely shared outside a few ZIP codes in New York and around San Francisco. One role of the meeting is to spur ideas for changing this situation. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment.In Apple\u2019s case, Mr. Trump has said he told its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, in late November that he wants the company to build \u201ca big plant\u201d in the United States \u2014 or even better, \u201cmany big plants.\u201dApple itself does not do any manufacturing in the United States. A contractor, Flex, manufactures high-end desktop computers on its behalf in Austin, Tex., employing about 2,000 people. A vast majority of Apple\u2019s production is in China, where there is an enormous ecosystem devoted to it. Many economists say that reproducing such an interlocking web of suppliers here would push the cost of iPhones up considerably.Mr. Trump also tangled with Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, during the campaign, saying that Mr. Bezos has \u201ca huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dIf there are some overtures being made in Silicon Valley, there are also some lines being drawn.Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week\u2019s meeting: defiance.\u201cIf an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company\u2019s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him,\u201d Mr. Sacca said.Or perhaps everyone will get along fine. Some in Silicon Valley speculate that the rough moments between Mr. Trump and the tech industry come not because they are so different but because they are at the bottom so similar.\u201cTrump embodies the harsher aspects of Silicon Valley \u2014 a brash and arrogant disrupter, convinced that the world is all wrong as it is and only he can change it for the better,\u201d said Shiva Ramesh, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious-yet-vague plans have a familiar ring. \u201cSounds like the pitch of some start-ups: \u2018It is all there in my head and in a one-page plan, it will all work out, I can do it, trust me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Join Our Board: Companies Hotly Pursue New Wave of Women in Tech", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For months, technology companies have pursued Amy Chang.\u201cI turned down 15 to 20 first meetings\u201d about joining a company board this year, said Ms. Chang, 39, who was an executive at Google for seven years before founding Accompany, which makes an executive-briefing app. \u201cThis whole thing is so crazy.\u201dEven by Silicon Valley standards, where recruiting wars are legion, attracting women to join tech company boards has become intense. While many companies still want the highest-profile women in the industry \u2014 think Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook or Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise \u2014 a new pool of candidates is also being hotly pursued. And those women are younger, tend to be ethnically diverse and have grown up in digital businesses for much of their careers.\u201cBoards are looking at diversity across multiple dimensions, such as gender, ethnicity, age and unique skill sets,\u201d said David Chun, the chief executive of Equilar, which tracks board candidates and executive compensation. \u201cIf you can bring a number of these different attributes and perspectives to the boardroom, you\u2019ll be in high demand.\u201dThe clamor for these women has spread beyond Silicon Valley\u2019s large public tech companies to privately held start-ups as well, some of which could emerge as the next public giants. Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, a closely held online real estate brokerage, said he sometimes had to mount \u201cpitched efforts\u201d to attract female candidates to his company\u2019s nine-member board, because many other start-up chief executives were after the same people.\u201cA lot of executives are trying to do this,\u201d Mr. Kelman said. \u201cIf I dillydallied, suddenly everyone was recruiting\u201d the same person.Ms. Bornstein, 46, a former chief digital officer at Sephora, said she had gotten 30 or 40 calls to discuss joining a corporate board over the last few years, even though she had never sat on one. Before becoming a member of Redfin\u2019s board, Ms. Bornstein said, she also talked to two public companies about a board spot, though she lost out to other women for those positions.Yet many hurdles still prevent women from joining more tech boards, Ms. Bornstein said. As she interviewed at companies about board seats, she said, she found that many directors typically stuck to their own networks of acquaintances for candidates. That generally led to looking at the same people over and over again.As a rule of thumb, boards also want experienced members. Part of the reason Ms. Bornstein said she did not land other board positions was because \u201cthey couldn\u2019t get their head around someone who hadn\u2019t been on a board before.\u201d Because there are \u201cfewer natural high-profile women in tech,\u201d she said, \u201cit requires taking bets on new people.\u201dTheBoardlist now has 1,300 names, up from 600 when the effort began, Ms. Singh Cassidy said. Less than half of those on the list have prior board experience, reflecting the up-and-coming nature of the group. Companies seeking a female board member can search through the list for ideas.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of educating that needs to be done,\u201d said Ms. Singh Cassidy, who is on the boards of TripAdvisor and Ericsson. But she said she was encouraged that some of the larger tech companies had embraced board diversity, which has spilled over to start-ups. \u201cThere has been pressure from all parts of the ecosystem, which has created a groundswell,\u201d she said.In the end, it often takes a chief executive to be open-minded about recruiting a different type of board member. That is what happened with Ms. Chang at Cisco.That kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is atypical of board members at Cisco, where directors tend to be more experienced. The company\u2019s longtime board members include John L. Hennessy, 64, the former president of Stanford University, and Carol Bartz, 68, the former chief executive of Yahoo.Yet Ms. Chang\u2019s differences were precisely what drew Chuck Robbins, Cisco\u2019s chief executive. After seeing the Accompany app this year and learning about Ms. Chang, he met with her and they hit it off. Ms. Chang soon interviewed with other Cisco board members, who concluded she would be an asset, Mr. Robbins said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s all about bringing on fresh perspectives and a different set of experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means they bring a different set of thinking to the boardroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Problem for Democratic Leaders Is Democratic Voters", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byLeaders on the Democratic left who want to represent the have-nots face an obstacle: their own voters.Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, argues that Democrats \u201chave to stand for a strong, populist economic message.\u201d He warns that \u201cthe way the working class is always controlled is that it\u2019s divided.\u201dA key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship, Senator Bernie Sanders, believes thatDemocrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country.a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.The problem facing Ellison, Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic electorate has actually become less receptive to populism over the past two decades.Mark Muro, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinton and those that backed Donald Trump. The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect.The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America\u2019s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015.In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection.Muro enlarged on his findings in an email:These industries encompass the nation\u2019s \u201ctech\u201d sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country\u2019s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth.The importance of these industries does not stop there:The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It\u2019s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people \u2014 those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they\u2019re going to make ends meet.Ellison\u2019s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial.In other words, as Muro made clear in his email:shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties.From 2009 to October 2016, Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm pro-trade stance, 48-37, 11 points in favor, to a decisively pro-trade position, 56-31. The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders.Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24.If anything, Trump\u2019s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade.This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas \u2014 in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.Among Democrats during this same period, Putin\u2019s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62.An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails.In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years.Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month.Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email,the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains.In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact \u2014 shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped.Although Trump\u2019s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters.Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party\u2019s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective.An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, \u201cRecent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,\u201d shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off.The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call \u201cskill downsizing.\u201d Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained.Despite Trump\u2019s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes \u2014 imports plus exports \u2014 have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent.Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreementsare not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they\u2019re about setting expansive \u201crules of the road\u201d that determine who wins and who loses.The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process:With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the \u2018winners\u2019 under these rules.Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party\u2019s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies \u2014 including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing.Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status.The nation\u2019s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks \u2014 and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation\u2019s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.Advertisement"}
