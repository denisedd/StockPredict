{"Headline": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats and Feds in Dispute on Trump\u2019s D.C. Hotel Lease", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 The General Services Administration disputed House Democrats on President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s need to sell off his Washington hotel.\u25a0 Senators suggest Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser may not be eligible for a security clearance.\u25a0 Senate Democrats to Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for education secretary: Pay the fines for your campaign finance violations.A spokeswoman for the G.S.A. came right back and said no, it hadn\u2019t.\u201cGSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the President-elect to divest of his financial interests. We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature. In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.\u201dThat is quite a different characterization than the one House Democrats gave. They wrote:\u201cG.S.A. assesses that Mr. Trump will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, unless he fully divests himself of all financial interests in the lease for the Washington, D.C., hotel. The deputy commissioner made clear that Mr. Trump must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well.\u201dNo word yet from Mr. Trump about how he will proceed. Not even the G.S.A.\u2019s deputy commissioner of public building services has heard a peep in response.\u201cIn fact, the deputy commissioner informed our staffs that the G.S.A. has received no communications to date from Mr. Trump\u2019s business organization about this issue. This raises serious questions about how Mr. Trump plans to proceed.\u201dBut the G.S.A. is not exactly saying all is fine with the hotel. More like, let\u2019s wait until Mr. Trump is actually sworn in.Two Democratic senators are raising a new issue about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser: They are questioning whether he should be allowed to hold a security clearance, citing past investigations into charges that Mr. Flynn leaked classified information and into potential conflicts presented by a private intelligence firm he owns.His business, the Flynn Intel Group, has hazy ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government, and that \u201ccreates potential for pressure, coercion and exploitation by foreign agents,\u201d the two senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Personnel Management.He also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the network\u2019s lavish anniversary party in Moscow.In addition, Mr. Flynn was investigated, but cleared of any wrongdoing, in 2010 for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan.But it is Mr. Flynn\u2019s business relationships that remain unresolved. He has said he plans to step back from the Flynn Intel Group and let his son, Michael G. Flynn, run it, according to the senators\u2019 letter, which was provided to The New York Times before its release on Wednesday.But that still does not settle the issue, the senators said.\u201cAny share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the emoluments clause of the constitution,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. Shaheen wrote.Senate Democrats have found a new bit of leverage against Ms. DeVos, the Michigan Republican Party leader who will soon be considered for the cabinet post of education secretary: her unpaid fines for campaign finance violations.All Children Matter broke Ohio election law by illegally sending $870,000 from its national PAC to its Ohio affiliate. The state of Ohio levied a record fine against the group.But the debt remains unpaid, the senators said. And now a confirmation vote looms.Two billionaire Silicon Valley executives, Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, and Travis Kalanick of Uber, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s roster of major American business advisers.The addition of Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick to Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum bring big technology names to the inner circle of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition that has had little engagement so far with Silicon Valley, except for the vocal support of the tech investor Peter Thiel.Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick engaged closely with the Obama administration, and their companies have increased their lobbying presence in Washington in recent years. Mr. Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, and his other firms, including Solar City and SpaceX, have been criticized by rivals for using federal and state subsidies. Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s ride-hailing business, has roiled the taxi industry and fought municipalities around the world for new regulations that allow it to operate.The forum, which includes the heads of Walt Disney and General Motors, will be led by Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and co-founder of the investment firm the Blackstone Group, the Trump transition team announced Wednesday. The group is charged with providing Mr. Trump with their individual views on how regulations affect jobs and economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the tech sector has been tense. His election was greeted with dismay by many in Silicon Valley, who supported the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the internet policy of net neutrality, and an increase in the immigration of highly skilled workers. Mr. Trump has promised to unroll all of those efforts.Mr. Trump singled out Apple for manufacturing parts of their devices abroad. He also criticized Amazon for its dominance, and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for owning The Washington Post, which he said had been unfair in its campaign coverage of him.The announcement that Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick were joining his business policy group came ahead of a meeting with several tech leaders at Trump Tower on Wednesday, including Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.To Mr. Trump, the job of the president is to focus on jobs. Virtually everything else is subservient to that: diplomacy, science, conservation.On Wednesday, he officially tapped former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to lead the Department of Energy, an agency whose primary tasks are to maintain the safety and reliability of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, counter nuclear proliferation, clean up Cold War radiation contamination and pursue basic science through the government\u2019s premier research laboratories.\u201cAs the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy,\u201d said President-elect Trump. \u201cMy administration is going to make sure we take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation.\u201dAfter a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday night, he thanked Wisconsin and reiterated his jobs message.It is the prism through which his selection of the Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex W. Tillerson for secretary of state, the Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder for labor secretary should be seen.As Mr. Trump prepares to meet with Big Tech, 19 organizations from the music industry, including the Americana Music Association, sent him a letter expressing their concern about content theft over shared platforms.Mr. Trump is familiar with musicians\u2019 concerns about using music without permission \u2014 he was criticized during his campaign by artists who did not want their songs played at his rallies.Mr. Stepien is now the leading contender to be the White House political director.Two people close to the transition said that Mr. Stepien, who was hired by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, after the final campaign shake-up, has been repeatedly mentioned for the role, although the decision is not final.Bridgegate aside, Mr. Stepien is credited by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers with helping him improve his field organization in crucial states, and contributing to his victory.Mr. Trump has chosen (who else?) a television star to sing the national anthem at his inauguration on Jan. 20.Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old singer who gained popularity as a contestant on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d said on Wednesday that it was \u201ca great honor\u201d to be asked to perform by Mr. Trump.Ms. Evancho met Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2011, after she had finished as the runner-up on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d NBC\u2019s hit series. She was 10 at the time.\u201cI\u2019m so excited; it\u2019s going to be awesome,\u201d she said after making the announcement on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.Ms. Evancho, of course, is too young to vote.One day after top congressional Republicans said an investigation was necessary, Ms. Pelosi questioned their conviction. \u201cThat\u2019s a statement of fact,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not a statement of action.\u201dShe said a panel of outside investigators with subpoena power needed to be convened.\u201cThe people have a right to know why Republicans are afraid of the truth,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s not unfair. Just as younger solvers can learn why the EDSEL never made it, older solvers are just as capable of learning the meaning of and using the word SHAWTY appropriately on their spouses or companions. Please let us all know how that works out for you.\u25a0 14A: E-HARMONY is a \u201cConnection site?\u201d because ... well ... that\u2019s where you supposedly make connections.\u25a0 21A: Read carefully: That\u2019s a Spanish word in the clue (\u201cFruta\u201d), so the answer has to be in Spanish. Today\u2019s fruta is the LIMON.\u25a0 28A: Wordplay alert! Did you think that the clue \u201cTesla competitor\u201d referred to a car? Not today; the answer is the inventor Nicola Tesla\u2019s competitor, Thomas Alva EDISON.\u25a0 4D: Not a packaging reference, nor is it the financial support of your company. \u201cFirm backing?\u201d is what can go at the end of a firm\u2019s name, and today that is LTD.\u25a0 10D: A good crossword clue can sometimes teach you to look at things in ways you might not have looked at them before. \u201cPrefix whose last two letters are a prefix meaning the same thing\u201d is AMBI, and the prefix \u201cBI-\u201d is a synonym for that answer.Next came the upper left, where I started with SHAWTY and HAM ON RYE (which just so happens to be an anagram of EHARMONY). I was pleased to incorporate TRY-HARD and the bizarre-looking OLE ELO in the crossings. In the lower right, I added a LOVER BOY to balance out the SHOWGIRL and BBQ SAUCE for some Scrabbly flavor. I wasn\u2019t thrilled with D.C. CAB but decided to cut my losses and move on to the lower left. My original lower left had YOUR FACE (clued as \u201cJuvenile comeback\u201d), but Will and Joel felt there was too much modern lingo in the grid, so I reworked that part.Looking back on this puzzle two years later, I honestly have mixed feelings about it. I\u2019m still happy with the freshness, Scrabbliness, and relative smoothness, but the fill is a bit heavy on \u201c17-year-old-guy\u201d entries (SHAWTY, INCUBI and even LOVER BOY and SHOWGIRL) for my current tastes. I hope solvers take this in stride, though, and realize that my intent was to be fresh but not demeaning.I also hope everyone in the crossword community has a wonderful Christmas Eve and start to Hanukkah!Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Final Frontier in Home Renovation: Giving Garages a Makeover", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byHOLMDEL, N.J. \u2014 As with a lot of homeowners, Nicholas Teetelli\u2019s garage was a disaster, an overstuffed hodgepodge of tools, seasonal supplies and things in that weird suburban purgatory \u2014 not yet ready to be tossed out, but no longer essential. \u201cIt looked like I could have been on an episode of \u2018Hoarders,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I need to take care of this.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so organized,\u201d he said, beaming. \u201cIt\u2019s a breath of fresh air.\u201dThese days, homeowners do not need an excuse like an over-the-top car to redo their garages. After updating kitchens, gilding bathrooms, finishing basements and lavishing money on landscaping and every other corner of their homesteads, they have targeted the garage as the next frontier in remodeling. Long considered an afterthought \u2014 a cold, cluttered point of egress \u2014 the garage has emerged as something worthy of turning into a showpiece.While it\u2019s possible to spruce up a garage for a few thousand dollars, major renovations can exceed $50,000, and a luxe garage, therefore, tends to be the province of the very rich.Paul Greskovich, the owner of Garage Craft Interiors, has focused on the Interstate 287 and 78 corridors in New Jersey because, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s where all the Wall Street money is.\u201dHe started his garage remodeling business a decade ago, hitting upon a niche that was novel. He soon had 18 competitors, though that number has dropped since the fiscal crisis of 2008.\u201cThe people who spend serious money on their garages are the ones who have already done everything else to the house, and they\u2019ve got nice cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThey suddenly realize that possibly the biggest room in the house is a debris field.\u201dReal estate brokers say a finished garage can add value and make an impression on home buyers. As more and more garages receive face-lifts, those buyers have come to expect a certain level of polish.\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to take it to the nines, where you have heated floors,\u201d said Libbe Pavony, a real estate agent with Houlihan Lawrence in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. \u201cBut the garage is a reflection on how you maintain your home in general. Some people take their old kitchen cabinets and attach them to the walls.\u201dMs. Pavony said heat was increasingly popular. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice feature,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for hobbyists. If someone does woodworking, the garage isn\u2019t just seasonal, and it can eliminate drafts in your house.\u201dSome homeowners are making renovations even more ambitious by expanding their garages. As family cars have morphed from station wagons to oversize sport-utility vehicles, many garages cannot fit two cars, let alone the other accouterments of suburban living, like beach chairs and bicycles, snow blowers and sleds. The emergence of shopping clubs like Costco and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club has put still more pressure on garages, with bulk items jockeying for space.Lauren Hammer, a property manager in New York City, hired a contractor, Peter Glass, to figure out ways to get more space from her tight garage in Briarcliff Manor. He is adding three feet of depth while also removing the center column, which involved installing a 4,000-pound girder across the ceiling for support.\u201cMy husband and I both drive S.U.V.s, and if you did food shopping, you couldn\u2019t open the trunk and get the groceries out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd without the center column, it will be so much easier to open your car door without worrying about nicking it.\u201dMrs. Hammer did not stop there. A marathon runner, she decided to add a \u201cwoman cave\u201d along one side of the garage, a fitness room where she can work out and cool down after runs.\u201cThe idea is that I have my own space to stretch and not bring my sweaty things into our house,\u201d she said.In one project, a couple who recently bought a split-level house wanted a central vacuuming system and a floor sink in the garage so that they could clean out their cars and wash their shoes before entering the house. In the other, a 50-year-old financial adviser doubled the size of his garage and installed two-zone heating for an adjoining work space. He also ordered a hydraulic lift so that he could hoist up his prized Porsche and squeeze another car in below. (The lift alone cost $40,000.)With the ease of keypads to open and close garage doors, homeowners increasingly enter and exit their houses through the garage, Mr. Glass said. \u201cKids don\u2019t carry keys anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the code for the keypad, and if your garage door opens, you know it because you get an alert on your phone. The front door has really become just for guests.\u201dMr. Glass believes that the constant exposure to the garage has helped propel it to the top of homeowners\u2019 remodeling lists, especially among the affluent, and pushed their investments ever higher.\u201cThe budgets are ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201dWhat seems to thrill some homeowners most about their renovated garage is the notion that everything has its place, whether a lacrosse stick, a flashlight or a spare tire. Mr. Teetelli, for instance, was more eager to show off his new storage units than his new Tesla. Maple-veneer cabinets concealed photography equipment, luggage, motorcycle helmets, cleaning products, batteries, a slow cooker, a pressure cooker and more than a dozen jars of Williams-Sonoma braising sauces, for which he admits a weakness.Along another wall, a storage system consisting of floor-to-ceiling slats fitted with hooks held bicycles, patio chairs, ladders, snow shovels and assorted storage baskets. Nothing touched the floor.\u201cIt\u2019s so cool,\u201d said Mr. Teetelli, 58, who also keeps two Harley-Davidson motorcycles in his garage.Tall metal shelves are neatly lined with gardening supplies; Halloween decorations; balloons and bubbles; housewares like light bulbs, picture hooks and paper towels; and assorted sports equipment, including helmets for football, hockey and bicycling. A shoe tree holds 18 pairs of athletic shoes. Everything is labeled.\u201cMost of our clients are mothers who need order,\u201d Ms. Zemachson said. She spoke from experience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Dominating Self-Driving Tech? Motor City Says Not So Fast", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byIn the race to develop self-driving cars, Michigan is suddenly aiming to give Silicon Valley a run for its money.The Motor City has been the center of the United States auto industry for more than a century. But as computer chips and software have become increasingly important in automobiles, Silicon Valley has seemed to take the lead, especially in the development of the supersmart cars of tomorrow.Google and Tesla, for example, have been at the forefront in creating cars with the ability to drive themselves. And many automakers have opened California outposts to become part of the high-tech scene. Uber and Lyft, the app-based ride-hailing services, are both based in San Francisco.But Michigan is trying to regain the high ground. General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are all engaged in autonomous vehicle projects based in Detroit\u2019s environs. And the state government is laying the ground for even more self-driving development work.The latest step came this month when Gov. Rick Snyder signed a package of laws to permit more extensive testing of self-driving cars on public roads, while clearing the way for use of autonomous vehicles in trials by ride-hailing services.\u201cWe are opening a new portal for autonomous technology,\u201d Mr. Snyder said in an interview. \u201cThis helps reinforce the message that Michigan is a place of innovation.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Nevada and Arizona are also vying to lure companies that are testing and developing self-driving cars. What\u2019s at stake is a potential economic boost \u2014 the millions of dollars automakers and others are spending on research and engineering, and the high-paying jobs they are creating.The city of Pittsburgh is also intent on competing with Detroit as a self-driving technopolis. Because of some pioneering research in self-driving technology at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh has emerged as a key development site.Even before Michigan passed its new laws, the state was gaining ground. Earlier this year Google\u2019s self-driving car project, now called Waymo, partnered with Fiat Chrysler to develop a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans and opened a technical office in Novi, Mich., near Detroit.The modified Pacifica vans, engineered in Michigan and assembled at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plant in Windsor, Ont., just across the river from Detroit, were delivered to Waymo on Monday. The two companies tested the first prototypes at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s proving grounds near Ann Arbor.The Canadian province of Ontario means to play its own big role in self-driving technology. Earlier this year, General Motors announced that it would create up to 1,000 engineering jobs, many focused on autonomous driving software development, in a suburb of Toronto. And this week Prime Minister Justin Trudeau officially opened BlackBerry\u2019s self-driving research center in Ottawa. It is based around a company formerly known QNX Software Systems, which has a long history as a supplier to auto companies.Back in Michigan, Ford is expanding its autonomous car efforts at its headquarters in Dearborn. It has built 30 self-driving cars and aims to have a fully automated car, with no steering wheel or pedals, in volume production by 2021. Ford intends for those cars to be first used in urban, ride-hailing fleets.The University of Michigan has created a 32-acre center for testing self-driving vehicles in Ann Arbor. Called MCity, the 32-acre facility has streets, intersections, traffic lights and road signs that provide a realistic environment where companies can hone autonomous vehicles before putting them on public roads.The university has also broken ground on a much larger, 335-acre site that was once the home of a World War II bomber factory.Michigan\u2019s new laws allow the testing of autonomous vehicles that have no steering wheel or gas and brake pedals. California prohibits testing of such cars on public roads. Michigan is also allowing more extensive testing of autonomous trucks traveling in groups or platoons.\u201cThere\u2019s the wrangling going on between the tech companies and the authorities in California over what is and what isn\u2019t allowed,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. \u201cMeanwhile, in Michigan, you get the sense that it\u2019s \u2018What can we do to help you?\u2019\u201dGeneral Motors, the nation\u2019s biggest automaker, said last week that it planned to soon begin testing its autonomous vehicles on Michigan roads. The company added that it would also build its first self-driving Chevrolet Bolts \u2014 already available as an all-electric car for human drivers \u2014 at an assembly plant in the Detroit suburb of Orion Township. G.M. is not saying when self-driving cars will be available for sale, but that it expects the Bolt will initially be for ride-hailing services.The addition of autonomous vehicles early next year may help secure the long-term future of the Orion Township plant, which makes the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact as well as the Bolt.G.M.\u2019s decision to centralize its production of self-driving models in Orion Township is a big step toward making Michigan a manufacturing hub for autonomous cars.\u201cWe expect to be the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass-production assembly plant,\u201d Mary Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, said at Friday\u2019s announcement.G.M. has already been testing autonomous Bolts at its technical center in Warren, Mich., as well as on public roads in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz.But Ms. Barra said Michigan\u2019s new law would help make the state the center of its winter-weather tests. \u201cBeing here where we can get the cold, snow and all the different weather conditions,\u201d she said, \u201cis very important.\u201dIan Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Bring Back Jobs, Mr. President-Elect? Call Elon Musk", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byDealBookPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald Trump: Please think about calling Elon Musk.President-elect Trump has spent a lot of time talking about how he plans to reinvigorate the manufacturing sector, repeatedly telling the public on the campaign trail, \u201cWe are going to bring back jobs that have been stolen from you.\u201dMr. Musk, 45, is arguably the one person in the nation more responsible than anyone else for generating a vision for the re-emergence of manufacturing in the United States en masse. And he is revered among most of his peers here in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.After the factory is complete, 95 percent of the parts contained in Tesla vehicles will be made in the United States. His company\u2019s leading-edge advances have pushed the entire auto industry to innovate, with rivals seeking to copy many of Tesla\u2019s best features.This is the future of manufacturing \u2014 much more so than the 1,000 jobs saved at the Carrier plant in Indiana last week.And Tesla\u2019s challenges are a microcosm of the trade issues that confound so many American manufacturers: To sell its cars in China, Tesla faces tariffs and other disincentives that make its vehicles 40 percent more expensive than locally produced electric cars, according to Mr. Musk. If you flip it around, China faces only a nominal tax to sell electric cars and parts in the United States. The situation is fairly similar in much of Europe.Still, conservative groups and individuals have taken to the internet with a litany of real and fake stories attacking Mr. Musk for the government subsidies Tesla receives, and for his vocal warnings on climate change.Robert E. Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy Corporation, the largest privately owned coal company, called Mr. Musk \u201ca fraud\u201d for accepting $2 billion in government subsidies for Tesla.Mr. Musk, fighting back on Twitter, wrote of Mr. Murray, a Republican who doesn\u2019t believe human activity is affecting the climate: \u201cReal fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for \u2018subsidies\u2019, Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero?\u201dTo Mr. Musk\u2019s critics, he and the subsidies that have been offered to companies like his \u2014 mostly in the form of federal clean-energy tax credits and rebates \u2014 represent the \u201cswamp\u201d that Mr. Trump says he wants to \u201cdrain.\u201dSeparately, Jim Chanos, the investor who has bet against the price of Tesla\u2019s shares, called Mr. Musk\u2019s merger of Tesla and SolarCity, both of which he controlled, a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201d Some analysts denounced Mr. Musk as a \u201ccorporate governmental mess\u201d and others have called him a huckster.Indeed, while Mr. Musk gets painted as a beneficiary of crony capitalism and the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to promote green energy, he is \u2014 perhaps counterintuitively \u2014 a prime example of everything we want our business leaders to be.What other chief executive do you know who takes only $1 a year in salary and has never sold a share of Tesla except to pay taxes? Yes, he pays taxes \u2014 to the tune of some $600 million in just the past year. He has about as much skin in the game as any C.E.O. in the country. (If you\u2019re asking how he pays to live, he has taken out a series of loans from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, using his shares as collateral. For some, that raises its own corporate governance concerns. However, the loans represent only about 5 percent of his net worth, so unless shares of Tesla fall precipitously, he should be able to cover the loan amounts.)And when questions arose about whether Tesla would be able to pay off SolarCity\u2019s debt after the two companies merged, Mr. Musk declared, \u201cI would pay it personally if need be.\u201d That\u2019s putting your money where your mouth is.As for the government subsidies offered to the electric car industry, Mr. Musk has made a compelling case that he would benefit more if the subsidies didn\u2019t exist.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.\u201cIronically, if all incentives and subsidies were removed for Tesla, Tesla\u2019s competitive position would increase, not decrease,\u201d he said recently at a shareholder meeting. \u201cWe do believe there should be government incentives for electric vehicles, but we believe they should be there for the good of the industry and to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport \u2014 not because Tesla needs them.\u201dThe incentives, he went on, \u201cdon\u2019t scale or are disadvantageous.\u201d The credits are worth less to Tesla than to a traditional carmaker that also sells conventional vehicles, Mr. Musk said, adding that the credits are reduced after production of 200,000 electric vehicles, so they are \u201cessentially irrelevant for any high-volume program.\u201dTesla\u2019s current customers \u2014 many of whom have paid more than $100,000 for their snappy electric roadsters \u2014 are probably unaffected by the $7,500 subsidy. And by the time Tesla is selling vehicles for $35,000, as it plans to, the rebate will be cut in half because the company will be producing too many cars to qualify.\u201cLet\u2019s say the new president erased all incentives,\u201d Mr. Musk said, \u201cTesla\u2019s competitive position would be better.\u201dAll that may be hard to square in the short term: Tesla turned a $22 million profit last quarter, in part after selling $139 million from zero-emission vehicle credits to other car manufacturers. But it is undoubtedly true in the long term.Whether Mr. Musk\u2019s various businesses will succeed, of course, remains an open question. But it is his kind of businesses \u2014 which offer the chance to restore real manufacturing jobs in America, and which integrate meaningful technological innovation \u2014 that we should all be encouraging.On Monday, I sent an email to Mr. Musk in hopes that writing this column wouldn\u2019t be for naught. After all, when I had spoken to him at a Vanity Fair conference in 2015 about the election, he told me he was not a supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.In a note back to me on Monday, Mr. Musk said he was heartened by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent acknowledgment that human-driven global warming may be real.Would he want to engage with the president-elect?\u201cI\u2019d be happy to talk to Trump,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.Advertisement"}

The company, the officials said, did not have the necessary state permits for autonomous driving.\u201cIt is illegal for the company to operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads until it receives an autonomous vehicle testing permit,\u201d Brian G. Soublet, deputy director of California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a letter to Uber. \u201cAny action by Uber to continue the operation of vehicles equipped with autonomous technology on public streets in California must cease until Uber complies.\u201dUber did not return a request for comment about the letter.Even before the service began in San Francisco, questions arose over whether Uber was allowed to test its driverless technology in the city. As of Dec. 8, the company\u2019s name was not listed on the D.M.V.\u2019s website as having a permit to test the vehicles in the state. Companies like Google, Tesla and General Motors all hold permits to test autonomous vehicles in California.When asked, Uber said that it was compliant with all federal and state laws. In California, it said, the motor vehicle department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive \u201cwithout the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\u201d Uber said its self-driving cars, which require a person at the wheel to monitor or control them, did not fall under that strict definition.The dispute was a reminder that Uber has not expanded its service without regulatory hassles. As it has grown, it has run into battles with the authorities worldwide, with regulators often contending that Uber had a dearth of licensed drivers, among other issues.Uber began Wednesday with Anthony Levandowski, its vice president of self-driving technology, saying in a blog post that \u201cthe promise of self-driving is core to our mission of reliable transportation, everywhere for everyone.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.For a while on Wednesday, any San Francisco passenger who requested a ride from UberX, one of the service\u2019s cheaper options, might have been picked up by an autonomous vehicle. They would have received a notification in the Uber app, and could accept or cancel and request a regular driver. An engineer behind the wheel in each self-driving vehicle could take over when needed.Three passengers were able to fit into the XC90 vehicles. Riders could use with a large touch screen that displayed the car\u2019s route, as well as a rendered version of the environment the car saw through its cameras and laser guidance systems. Uber also let passengers take selfies from a camera facing the back seat, which they can email to themselves and share on social media.Uber wanted to use the expansion of the program to test routes and terrain beyond what it experienced in Pittsburgh.\u201cWe drove in the rain and other kinds of weather, and we\u2019ve added lane-changing capabilities since we started in September,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said in an interview, adding that Uber has faced no major issues in its testing in Pennsylvania thus far. \u201cNow we want to see how we operate in this new environment, especially with the giant hills that San Francisco has to offer.\u201dUber may have gotten more than it bargained for. Shortly after the service began, one of its Volvo XC90s ran a red light, and was caught on camera. The episode raised questions about the safety of Uber\u2019s self-driving technology.\u201cThis incident was due to human error,\u201d Uber said in a statement about the video, which was posted to YouTube. \u201cThis vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate.\u201dA headline on Thursday with an article about Uber\u2019s testing of a self-driving car service in San Francisco misidentified the government body that told the company in a letter that such a service was illegal because the proper permits were not obtained.

The two men are being appointed as co-directors of Uber\u2019s new in-house research arm on artificial intelligence, which the ride-hailing company unveiled on Monday. The research arm\u2019s aim is to apply A.I. in areas like self-driving vehicles, along with solving other technological challenges through machine learning.All 15 people from the start-up will be absorbed by Uber. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The acquisition and new research arm, which will be called Uber\u2019s A.I. Labs, exemplifies how seriously Silicon Valley tech companies are betting on artificial intelligence. Google, Facebook and others have also pushed into artificial intelligence, which underlies voice recognition software, digital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, and technologies like self-driving cars. Many companies are racing to bring on new A.I. talent to compete against one another.\u201cEvery major company realizes how essential A.I. is to what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of data people are operating on, even the smallest gains in efficiency can turn out enormous changes at these companies, especially in terms of profit.\u201dMany of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, have tried to commercialize artificial intelligence through the application of algorithms modeled largely on how the human brain functions. This method, called deep learning, leans heavily on the vast data sets that private technology companies own and that are used to train computers to do simple tasks, such as match patterns or recognize faces in photographs.Part of what drew Uber to Dr. Marcus\u2019s team is that his start-up is tackling artificial intelligence in a different way. Rather than taking just one approach like deep learning, Geometric Intelligence combines data scientists who use varying techniques to study artificial intelligence, including the Bayesian and \u201cevolutionary\u201d methods.Dr. Marcus, who helped found Geometric Intelligence in late 2014, said the gist of his philosophy goes something like this: Instead of training machines by feeding them enormous amounts of data, what if computers were capable of learning more like humans by extrapolating a system of rules from just a few or even a single example?Besides autonomous vehicles, Uber said it expected its A.I. Labs to apply its method to other tasks, including combating fraud, extracting information from street signs and learning to improve its mapping research and capabilities.\u201cWhen step function changes in this field occur, we\u2019re going to see very significant differences in how businesses run themselves,\u201d Jeff Holden, Uber\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. He said the A.I. Labs and Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, which is home to the company\u2019s self-driving car research, will work in tandem with each other.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long time before a self-driving car will be able to make all the kinds of trips that Uber does every single day,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cBut the answers to this are all going to come in the form of artificial intelligence.\u201dMr. Holden said recruiting A.I. research talent is highly competitive, especially as Google, Apple and Tesla are also developing self-driving cars or related projects.\u201cFrom a defensive perspective, if someone else develops them first, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a new co-director of Uber\u2019s in-house research arm on artificial intelligence.

She bounced back quickly, though, establishing Color Force in 2007.She and her dogs passed through a wooden gate and went inside. The interior had the feel of a tech start-up, with concrete floors, a kitchen and lots of open space. Twelve black-and-white portraits of \u201cHunger Games\u201d characters took prime position on a wall outside her office, with Jennifer Lawrence, looking regal as the fierce heroine Katniss Everdeen, in the center.That blockbuster franchise fits perfectly with what Ms. Jacobson is trying to accomplish in a male-dominated industry: to bring to the screen stories centered on women and others underrepresented in movies. Among the projects she has in the works are adaptations of the novels \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d by Donna Tartt and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d by Kevin Kwan, and for television, the \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d series, which explores race, society and culture.In late October, Ms. Jacobson met with the screenwriter Christina Hodson, recently hired by Warner Bros. to write a reboot of the 1993 action hit \u201cThe Fugitive,\u201d who had an appointment to go over a script in development at Color Force that centered on a mythological tribe of women warriors who invade ancient Greece.Before they got down to discussing characters and story beats, Ms. Hodson described a run-in she had at the Austin Film Festival, where she was on a panel to discuss women and movies.\u201cThis guy puts his hand up and says: \u2018First of all, let me just say, I love women. Don\u2019t mix me up with other guys,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hodson recalled. After his little preamble, the screenwriter said, the man went on to ask Ms. Hodson, who is half-Asian and was raised in London, if she owed her success more to the film industry\u2019s attempts to hire women and minorities than to her own talent.Ms. Jacobson rolled her eyes and said: \u201cOh, brother. You don\u2019t ever hear about a man being asked, \u2018How did you get that job?\u2019\u201d\u201cI was so pissed,\u201d Ms. Hodson said. \u201cI told him we have to work four times as hard.\u201dThe conversation moved on to the movie, a tale of two sisters, one the leader of a fierce warrior tribe driving the action.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it silly,\u201d Ms. Hodson said.\u201cNo,\u201d Ms. Jacobson replied. \u201cThese women are badass.\u201dMs. Jacobson knows how hard it is for women in Hollywood, on both sides of the camera.\u201cI\u2019ve been fired from almost every job I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said.But not long after she lost the big executive position at Disney, she was playing a key role in the development of the most lucrative franchise of the current decade, the \u201cHunger Games\u201d series, which, in addition to making bank, has provided filmgoers with the most visible symbol of female empowerment since Thelma and Louise hit the road 25 years ago. And unlike her cinematic predecessors, it should be noted, Katniss does not meet a tragic end.Ms. Jacobson, who is Jewish and gay, was raised in Brentwood and studied semiotics at Brown University. One of her first jobs after college was working for Joel Silver, the producer of the \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d and \u201cMatrix\u201d action films. In those days, Ms. Jacobson wore Dr. Martens as she read scripts and suggested ideas. Now, she mostly wears black.In 1995, she and the producer Bruce Cohen, who would win an Oscar for \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d and receive a nomination for \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d started Out There, a grass-roots group comprising gay men and lesbians in entertainment.By that time, Ms. Jacobson was in a relationship with Jen Bleakley, now her wife with whom she has three children. During an Out There meeting held at Mr. Cohen\u2019s house in the mid-\u201990s, Ms. Jacobson met Ryan Murphy, the producer and writer known for the television shows \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to forget how radical it was in that age for a gay woman to not be afraid,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.That night, he recalled, the group talked about how to add same-sex couples into scripts and fight discrimination in the workplace.\u201cIt was almost like a gay kindergarten, where you learned the tools,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.Cut to a garden table at Tiato, a restaurant in Santa Monica on a sun-drenched afternoon, where Ms. Jacobson was meeting with two friends: Zanne Devine, a Miramax executive she has known for nearly 30 years, and Audrey Wells, the writer-director of the 2003 romance \u201cUnder The Tuscan Sun,\u201d which Ms. Jacobson greenlit in her executive days at Disney.The lunch-table talk turned to how Hollywood has shown signs of change since then.\u201cYou assumed that movies about women should be made, and women should make them,\u201d Ms. Wells told Ms. Jacobson.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t act like you were making a sacrifice or saying yes on a whim,\u201d Ms. Wells said. For instance, she said, when she ran into trouble with an unruly Italian crew during the filming of \u201cUnder the Tuscan Sun,\u201d Ms. Jacobson came through with support.\u201cShe believed me instead of saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d Ms. Wells said, adding that Ms. Jacobson gave her two extra weeks of filming.\u201cThose were the days,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said with a sigh.As the three tucked into salads and glasses of iced tea, Ms. Jacobson told the story of how, exactly, she was fired in 2006. On a Sunday in July, Ms. Jacobson got a heads-up call from a reporter who had heard layoffs were in the offing at Disney. Ms. Jacobson called the studio\u2019s chairman, Dick Cook, only to hear nothing back. The next morning, she was in the delivery room at St. John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, where her wife was in labor with their third child. To complicate matters, her father had been admitted to the intensive care unit, too. Then, Ms. Jacobson said, her boss finally returned the call. He fired her over the phone.\u201cI was furious, so mad, about how they went about it,\u201d said Ms. Devine, the Miramax executive.Ms. Wells added: \u201cShe had just done \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean,\u2019 and it made no sense. The way I felt about it was: Today your vengeance begins. And, boy, did she prove that to be the case.\u201d\u201cI was terrified,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said.Disney tried to make it up to her by offering her a production deal. But Ms. Jacobson turned it down flat.\u201cI was like, I don\u2019t want to work for the people who just fired me,\u201d she said.For the project, Ms. Jacobson sought writers of different socioeconomic backgrounds who understood Southern culture. \u201cIt was actually the most awkward thing I\u2019ve had to do, call all these agents and say, \u2018Hey, I need your black writers from the South,\u201d said Allison Friedman, an executive at Color Force. The production company received 200 writing samples, which it winnowed down to 20 potential candidates. Of those, the company hired a diverse crew of eight writers.\u201cThere were great writers I\u2019d never heard of,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Great A.I. Awakening", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "FeatureHow Google used artificial intelligence to transform Google Translate, one of its more popular services \u2014 and how machine learning is poised to reinvent computing itself.Supported byLate one Friday night in early November, Jun Rekimoto, a distinguished professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Tokyo, was online preparing for a lecture when he began to notice some peculiar posts rolling in on social media. Apparently Google Translate, the company\u2019s popular machine-translation service, had suddenly and almost immeasurably improved. Rekimoto visited Translate himself and began to experiment with it. He was astonished. He had to go to sleep, but Translate refused to relax its grip on his imagination.Rekimoto wrote up his initial findings in a blog post. First, he compared a few sentences from two published versions of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Takashi Nozaki\u2019s 1957 translation and Haruki Murakami\u2019s more recent iteration, with what this new Google Translate was able to produce. Murakami\u2019s translation is written \u201cin very polished Japanese,\u201d Rekimoto explained to me later via email, but the prose is distinctively \u201cMurakami-style.\u201d By contrast, Google\u2019s translation \u2014 despite some \u201csmall unnaturalness\u201d \u2014 reads to him as \u201cmore transparent.\u201dThe second half of Rekimoto\u2019s post examined the service in the other direction, from Japanese to English. He dashed off his own Japanese interpretation of the opening to Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,\u201d then ran that passage back through Google into English. He published this version alongside Hemingway\u2019s original, and proceeded to invite his readers to guess which was the work of a machine.NO. 1:Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai \u201cNgaje Ngai,\u201d the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.NO. 2:Kilimanjaro is a mountain of 19,710 feet covered with snow and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. The summit of the west is called \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in Masai, the house of God. Near the top of the west there is a dry and frozen dead body of leopard. No one has ever explained what leopard wanted at that altitude.Even to a native English speaker, the missing article on the leopard is the only real giveaway that No. 2 was the output of an automaton. Their closeness was a source of wonder to Rekimoto, who was well acquainted with the capabilities of the previous service. Only 24 hours earlier, Google would have translated the same Japanese passage as follows:Kilimanjaro is 19,710 feet of the mountain covered with snow, and it is said that the highest mountain in Africa. Top of the west, \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in the Maasai language, has been referred to as the house of God. The top close to the west, there is a dry, frozen carcass of a leopard. Whether the leopard had what the demand at that altitude, there is no that nobody explained.Rekimoto promoted his discovery to his hundred thousand or so followers on Twitter, and over the next few hours thousands of people broadcast their own experiments with the machine-translation service. Some were successful, others meant mostly for comic effect. As dawn broke over Tokyo, Google Translate was the No. 1 trend on Japanese Twitter, just above some cult anime series and the long-awaited new single from a girl-idol supergroup. Everybody wondered: How had Google Translate become so uncannily artful?Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, stood to make a few opening remarks. A friend, he began, had recently told him he reminded him of Google. \u201cWhy, because I know all the answers?\u201d the mayor asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the friend replied, \u201cbecause you\u2019re always trying to finish my sentences.\u201d The crowd tittered politely. Khan concluded by introducing Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who took the stage.Pichai was in London in part to inaugurate Google\u2019s new building there, the cornerstone of a new \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d under construction at King\u2019s Cross, and in part to unveil the completion of the initial phase of a company transformation he announced last year. The Google of the future, Pichai had said on several occasions, was going to be \u201cA.I. first.\u201d What that meant in theory was complicated and had welcomed much speculation. What it meant in practice, with any luck, was that soon the company\u2019s products would no longer represent the fruits of traditional computer programming, exactly, but \u201cmachine learning.\u201dA rarefied department within the company, Google Brain, was founded five years ago on this very principle: that artificial \u201cneural networks\u201d that acquaint themselves with the world via trial and error, as toddlers do, might in turn develop something like human flexibility. This notion is not new \u2014 a version of it dates to the earliest stages of modern computing, in the 1940s \u2014 but for much of its history most computer scientists saw it as vaguely disreputable, even mystical. Since 2011, though, Google Brain has demonstrated that this approach to artificial intelligence could solve many problems that confounded decades of conventional efforts. Speech recognition didn\u2019t work very well until Brain undertook an effort to revamp it; the application of machine learning made its performance on Google\u2019s mobile platform, Android, almost as good as human transcription. The same was true of image recognition. Less than a year ago, Brain for the first time commenced with the gut renovation of an entire consumer product, and its momentous results were being celebrated tonight.Translate made its debut in 2006 and since then has become one of Google\u2019s most reliable and popular assets; it serves more than 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day in a different language. It exists not only as its own stand-alone app but also as an integrated feature within Gmail, Chrome and many other Google offerings, where we take it as a push-button given \u2014 a frictionless, natural part of our digital commerce. It was only with the refugee crisis, Pichai explained from the lectern, that the company came to reckon with Translate\u2019s geopolitical importance: On the screen behind him appeared a graph whose steep curve indicated a recent fivefold increase in translations between Arabic and German. (It was also close to Pichai\u2019s own heart. He grew up in India, a land divided by dozens of languages.) The team had been steadily adding new languages and features, but gains in quality over the last four years had slowed considerably.Until today. As of the previous weekend, Translate had been converted to an A.I.-based system for much of its traffic, not just in the United States but in Europe and Asia as well: The rollout included translations between English and Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. The rest of Translate\u2019s hundred-odd languages were to come, with the aim of eight per month, by the end of next year. The new incarnation, to the pleasant surprise of Google\u2019s own engineers, had been completed in only nine months. The A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime.Grinning, Pichai read aloud an awkward English version of the sentence that had been rendered by the old Translate system: \u201cOne is not what is for what he writes, but for what he has read.\u201dTo the right of that was a new A.I.-rendered version: \u201cYou are not what you write, but what you have read.\u201dIt was a fitting remark: The new Google Translate was run on the first machines that had, in a sense, ever learned to read anything at all.The phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is invoked as if its meaning were self-evident, but it has always been a source of confusion and controversy. Imagine if you went back to the 1970s, stopped someone on the street, pulled out a smartphone and showed her Google Maps. Once you managed to convince her you weren\u2019t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\u2019t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \u2014 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \u201cA.I.,\u201d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d are thus constantly receding.The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Facebook\u2019s M, Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\u2019t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer. Management consultants are falling all over themselves to prep executives for the widening industrial applications of computers that program themselves. DeepMind, a 2014 Google acquisition, defeated the reigning human grandmaster of the ancient board game Go, despite predictions that such an achievement would take another 10 years.It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\u2019s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \u2014 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \u2014 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \u2014 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\u2019s \u201cmicrokitchens\u201d \u2014 the \u201cGoogley\u201d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\u2019s buildings \u2014 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \u201cneural networks,\u201d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\u2019s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\u2019s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \u201c20 percent\u201d \u2014 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \u2014 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \u201cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\u201d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\u2019s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\u2019s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\u2019s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \u201cminister of agriculture\u201d as \u201cpriest of farming.\u201d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d better than math and chess.There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\u2019t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.There has always been another vision for A.I. \u2014 a dissenting view \u2014 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\u2019t. What\u2019s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\u2019t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \u2014 sensory perception and motor control \u2014 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\u2019t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \u2014 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 and drew upon both the company\u2019s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \u2014 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.\u201cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\u201d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \u201cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\u2019ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\u201d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\u2019s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \u201cType in your LDAP\u201d \u2014 a user login \u2014 and he would flag a helper to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s an LDAP?\u201d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \u201cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\u2019t he get it?\u201d\u201cAt lunchtime,\u201d Hinton said, \u201csomeone in the queue yelled: \u2018Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\u2019 After that, it was all right.\u201dHinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\u2019s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \u201cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\u201dHinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\u2019s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \u201cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\u2019d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \u2014 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \u2014 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.The issue with multilayered, \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\u2019s easy. Imagine that you\u2019re playing with a child. You tell the child, \u201cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\u201d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \u201cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\u201d The child tries Box A. Bravo.These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \u201cconnectionism\u201d or \u201cparallel distributed processing.\u201d \u201cThis idea,\u201d Hinton told me, \u201cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\u2019s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\u2019\u2009It wasn\u2019t a very persuasive argument.\u201dTo understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\u2019re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\u2019t how they work. All they\u2019re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \u2014 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \u2014 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\u2019re feeding them is biased in the first place.If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \u201ccat.\u201d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \u201cNot cat.\u201d It is hyperliteral, or \u201cbrittle.\u201d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \u201cvoters,\u201d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \u201cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\u201d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \u201cA dog?\u201dYou say: \u201cNo, maestro, it\u2019s a cat. Try again.\u201dNow the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \u201ccat\u201d and which didn\u2019t. The ones that got \u201ccat\u201d right get their votes counted double next time \u2014 at least when they\u2019re voting for \u201ccat.\u201d They have to prove independently whether they\u2019re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\u2019s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\u2019s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\u2019s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\u2019s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \u201cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \u2018cats.\u2019\u2009\u201d The more \u201cvoters\u201d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \u2014 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\u2019s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\u2019s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \u201cdumbbell\u201d but the concept of \u201cdumbbell+arm,\u201d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\u2019s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\u2019s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?\u201cBut actually,\u201d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \u201cit\u2019s very hard.\u201d\u201cThere was a big debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cA very big debate.\u201d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\u2019d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a big debate.\u201dHe remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \u201cThis is the future.\u201d It was, he said, an \u201cunpopular decision at the time.\u201d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\u2019t quite understand Le\u2019s decision. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked Le in an email.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good answer back then,\u201d Le said. \u201cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\u201d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\u2019s ideas. \u201cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\u201dWhat happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \u2014 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\u2019t specify what it should or shouldn\u2019t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \u201cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\u201d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \u201csummarize\u201d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \u2014 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \u2014 the machine couldn\u2019t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\u2019s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \u201cchose\u201d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\u2019t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.Le didn\u2019t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\u2019t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\u2019s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\u2019s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\u2019t help myself and began to ask, \u201cIs he ... ?\u201d Le nodded. \u201cAt Facebook,\u201d he replied.)The hundred or so current members of Brain \u2014 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \u2014 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\u2019s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)When I began spending time at Brain\u2019s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \u201cJesse, 6/27.\u201d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.Brain\u2019s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \u201csuccess disaster\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the company\u2019s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.\u201cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis is how many machines we\u2019ll need.\u201d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.\u201cThat,\u201d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \u201csounded scary. You\u2019d have to\u201d \u2014 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \u2014 \u201cbuild new buildings.\u201dThere was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \u201ctensor processing units,\u201d and their value proposition \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\u2019s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \u201cNormally,\u201d Dean said, \u201cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\u201dLe\u2019s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \u2014 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\u2019s model didn\u2019t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\u2019t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \u201cYou think,\u201d Schuster says, \u201cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\u2019re done, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201dThe issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\u2019s code was custom-written, and it wasn\u2019t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\u2019s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\u2019t always make heads or tails of what they had done.As Schuster put it, \u201cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\u2019t know themselves why they worked.\u201dThis February, Google\u2019s research organization \u2014 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \u2014 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\u2019s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \u201clightning talks,\u201d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \u201cfacilitated discussions.\u201d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \u201cWe ambushed him.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \u201cWe have something to tell you.\u201dThey told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \u2014 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \u2014 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \u201cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\u201d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\u2019t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\u2019s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\u2019s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \u2014 and something akin to meaning.Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \u2014 not in a lab but at production scale \u2014 for years, to little avail.Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.Dean thought otherwise. \u201cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\u201d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \u201cif we put our minds to it.\u201dHughes was sure the conversion wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\u2019t personally care to be the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s prepare for 2016,\u201d he went back and told his team. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\u2019t deliver speed.\u201dA month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\u2019s new system with Hughes\u2019s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \u201cEnglish-French,\u201d he said, \u201cis so good that the improvement won\u2019t be obvious.\u201dIt was a challenge Schuster couldn\u2019t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.Hughes told Schuster\u2019s team they hadn\u2019t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.To be sure this wasn\u2019t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \u2014 Schuster, Wu and Chen \u2014 but with Hughes\u2019s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\u2019s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\u2019s case there was no ambiguity.The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \u201cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\u201d Schuster told me at one point. \u201cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\u201d \u2014 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \u2014 \u201cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\u201d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\u2019s there.\u201dMost of Google\u2019s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.\u201cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\u201dThe theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \u2014 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \u201cmere\u201d engineering \u2014 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\u2019s billions of words of training \u201creading\u201d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \u201cwords.\u201d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\u2019t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \u201cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\u2019s like a toddler. \u2018Oh, Daddy says that word when he\u2019s mad!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201dMore than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\u2019t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\u2019t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\u2019t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\u2019t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\u2019s service.Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\u2019t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t know to make it fast enough, but I don\u2019t know what it could be.\u201dHe did know, though, that they needed more computers \u2014 \u201cG.P.U.s,\u201d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \u2014 for training.Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \u201cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\u201dSchuster said, \u201cWhy not 2,000?\u201dTen days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \u2014 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \u201cPeople were almost yelling,\u201d Schuster said.By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \u201cword-piece model,\u201d a \u201ccoverage penalty,\u201d \u201clength normalization.\u201d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \u2014 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \u2014 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?\u201cWe did hundreds of experiments,\u201d Schuster told me, \u201cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\u2019re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\u2019m done? You never know you\u2019re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\u2019s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\u2019s hard for some people. It\u2019s a little bit an art \u2014 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\u201dThe Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \u201cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \u2018Oh, I did something first,\u2019 but who cares, in the end?\u201dThis did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\u2019t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a new system yet,\u201d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \u201cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\u2019s exploding on Twitter: \u2018Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.Google\u2019s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\u2019s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\u2019s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \u201cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\u201d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \u2014 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \u201ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\u201dTheir neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \u201cstep function forward\u201d \u2014 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.\u201cTo communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand cooperation!\u201dThe engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \u201cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\u201dEveryone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\u2019t.Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\u2019s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \u201cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\u201d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \u201cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\u201dFor the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\u2019t assume that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \u2014 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\u2019re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\u2019s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a machine \u2018knows\u2019 or \u2018understands\u2019 but what it \u2018does,\u2019 and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 what it doesn\u2019t do yet.\u201dWhere you come down on \u201cknowing\u201d versus \u201cdoing\u201d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\u2019s media reception. \u201cDid you see the first press?\u201d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\u2019. Over the final weeks of the paper\u2019s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\u201d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\u2019t about replacing people but helping them.And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \u201cinsight,\u201d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\u2019s antagonists, you can\u2019t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\u2019t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s causing the cancer.Then again, can the radiologist?Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \u2014 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\u2019re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\u2019re just telling you it\u2019s there.Once you\u2019ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \u2014 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \u2014 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \u2014 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\u2019re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\u2019re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\u2019s institution-building \u2014 and the consolidation of power \u2014 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \u201cninja\u201d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \u2014 for they\u2019re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \u2014 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \u2014 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\u2019s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, \u201cSo when do we get to delete it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe new code base is going to grow. Everything grows.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a computer used in space travel. A computer was used to guide Apollo missions \u2014 not the \u201cApollo shuttle.\u201d (There was no such shuttle.)Advertisement"}

The Fairfax Financial boss Prem Watsa has drafted an airtight policy for the insurance company\u2019s $4.9 billion deal to buy its Swiss rival Allied World. And BlackBerry, where Mr. Watsa is both the lead director and a major investor, is trying to parlay its smartphone history into hands-free driving success.Fairfax\u2019s offer for Allied, unveiled on Sunday, looks anodyne on the surface. The 18 percent premium to combine two players in the property and casualty market is hardly over the top. But Allied will continue to operate as a stand-alone company, so there are no planned cost savings. Fairfax\u2019s pitch is that the deal will diversify its earnings \u2014 and that both firms have good track records.Mr. Watsa has taken some of the sting out of the premium tail for Fairfax investors: Half of the $900 million cash component will come from a special dividend Allied will pay to its own shareholders. Governance, though, is more troubling. Mr. Watsa owns 43 percent of Fairfax but is not excluding himself from the vote to approve the deal. It would be a more hands-off decision if he followed the example of Elon Musk, who earlier this year left it to the other shareholders to decide whether Tesla Motors and SolarCity should merge.Fairfax also wants written support from other big owners to tip approval past the 50 percent needed, perhaps avoiding a vote involving all shareholders. The company has also left itself the flexibility to switch most of the financing for the deal to cash, which would remove the need for any vote at all.Mr. Watsa\u2019s fingerprints may not be as visible in BlackBerry\u2019s decision to invest more in autonomous cars, but he runs the board and is a crucial voice at the once high-flying tech company. Back in 2013 he made an offer to buy it, a Fairfax investment firm is the second-largest shareholder, and Fairfax is BlackBerry\u2019s \u201cleading lender,\u201d according to its chief executive, John Chen.Driverless-car technology is not an absurd road for BlackBerry to follow. Its QNX division already has some expertise and has Ford Motor as a client. The problem is that there are plenty of more specialized, deeper-pocketed companies on the autonomous bandwagon already. Mr. Watsa may yet have to take a firmer grip at BlackBerry, too.Advertisement"}

You would think.But the president-elect wanted more. Romney was a \u201cchoker,\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s earlier put-down; that, and he walked \u201clike a penguin.\u201d If Romney could take his flightless bird-in-a-tuxedo-act outside and apologize for calling Trump a fraud, then maybe the job was his. Romney would waddle no further. Apologize? Cripes, the title of his book is \u201cNo Apology.\u201dStill, high-five! For Trump, the debasement of Romney was just another hit of dopamine \u2014 the neurotransmitter once called the Kim Kardashian of molecules. He needs a jolt several times a day. But in turn, he gives it back to you, the millions in his personality cult, and certainly the click-bait web and cable press, who need it just as much.Earlier this month, Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, took to the floor of the House to plead for one thing from the incoming leader of the free world: \u201cStop tweeting, Mr. President-elect.\u201d Not a chance. His tiny fingers can launch 140 predawn characters from the fortress of his gilded tower and mighty Boeing will lose more than a billion dollars in stock value a few hours later.At the other end, his 17.3 million followers wake up every day eager for a shot of unfiltered Trump. It\u2019s a dangerous codependency. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d? \u201cUnwatchable!\u201d Vanity Fair, after a scathing review of a Trump restaurant? \u201cDead!\u201d The slaughter of civilians in the ancient city of Aleppo? Nothing. The real-world consequences of weaponized hatred are no concern for a man with a shameful incuriosity and a profound lack of empathy.But look again at the Trump Tower stage \u2014 it\u2019s Kanye! Who cares about Aleppo, or a foreign adversary deliberately trying to undermine an American election, when you\u2019ve got a troubled rapper stopping by for his hit of Trump. The Orange One recognizes him \u2014 on CNN, now cutting away from Syria.And so we see the clear design that Trump will use to rule: He will give us showmanship and cheap drama, put-downs and promises \u2014 the stagecraft of the world\u2019s most powerful narcissist. And meanwhile, the nation will be governed by oil oligarchs, climate change deniers and Goldman Sachs tycoons brought in to do the real work.The Koch brothers didn\u2019t support Trump. But they got their dream team of hold-back-the-clock fossil fools and corporate sycophants. The bullet-headed nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, is against expanding the minimum wage for all the poor souls who voted for Trump. The Energy Department nominee, Rick Perry, vowed to eliminate that very agency. And he sits on the board of the pipeline company that wants to carry oil directly under a tribal water supply in North Dakota.Pay no attention \u2014 it\u2019s back on the road with the thank you tour. This traveling gloat-fest is an excuse for more of the Trump narcotic. He is having trouble getting A-list musicians to perform at his inauguration. The sound of an angry mob is music enough. The rallies are a contact high for both sides and \u2014 as in Wisconsin the other day \u2014 a chance for one more chant of \u201cLock her up!\u201dBut locking Hillary Clinton up for careless management of her email could be problematic when it seems that Trump\u2019s future national security adviser, the fake news enthusiast Michael Flynn, was himself investigated for wrongly sharing classified information with foreign leaders.Time for another tweet, a put-down of a union man who dared to question how Trump played Indiana workers for suckers in his big factory stroll. Trump helped to save, at most, a thousand jobs. If President Obama had held a big press tour for all the 15 million new jobs created on his watch, he could boast of 36,000 jobs, once a week, throughout his eight years in office.It\u2019s boring stuff, anyway. Just like that daily intelligence briefing, which Trump says he doesn\u2019t need because \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person.\u201d But more to the point: for Trump, there\u2019s no thrill in basic information. He\u2019ll certainly feel something if there\u2019s a catastrophic terrorist attack and, as with George W. Bush, there was an intelligence community warning of a looming threat.Back to Trump Tower \u2014 oh look, all the tech titans! They didn\u2019t back him, these captains of Apple and Facebook, Tesla and Amazon. And, given his record of boasting on tape of being a sexual predator, Trump couldn\u2019t get hired as deputy office boy at any one of those companies.

Trump and the nation\u2019s tech elite was hyped as something out of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of \u201cDancing With the Silicon Valley Stars.\u201d\u201cThis is a truly amazing group of people,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The gathering included Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Elon Musk of Tesla; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, among others. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you folks do well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He kept going in that vein. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like you in the world,\u201d he enthused. \u201cIn the world! There\u2019s nobody like the people in this room.\u201d Anything that the government \u201ccan do to help this go along,\u201d he made clear, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be there for you.\u201dAnd that was just in the first few minutes. The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen.Even after the press was ushered out, the meeting continued its genial way. Among the topics discussed, according to several corporate executives and a transition official briefed on the meeting, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, were vocational education and the need for more of it, the promise and peril of trade with China and immigration (Mr. Trump wants \u201csmart and talented people here\u201d). The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste.There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you the hundreds of calls we\u2019ve had asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed.To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would \u2014 by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait.Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower\u2019s holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up.Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d\u201cI shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech \u2014 agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing \u2014 everywhere,\u201d he said.The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump\u2019s values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality.Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.)Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect\u2019s medium of choice for communication, was not invited.In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear.A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin.Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties.Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration.\u201cWe have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,\u201d he said.More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too.In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent.One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration.Another reason: less tech spending by the government. \u201cThere are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,\u201d said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst.As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs,\u201d the analyst said.So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Parent Company Spins Off Self-Driving Car Business", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s self-driving car is ready to take the wheel.Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, said on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company under the name Waymo.Alphabet\u2019s decision to spin out Waymo is a signal that the company thinks its self-driving technology has advanced beyond research project status and is ready for commercialization.Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers \u2014 all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry.Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning \u2014 the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time \u2014 mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years.\u201cAs we look at this space and the opportunities ahead of us, we see so much,\u201d said John Krafcik, chief executive of Waymo. \u201cWe\u2019re a new company, but we\u2019ve been at this for a while.\u201dWaymo joins the roster of Alphabet companies, which includes Google. Mr. Krafcik said the new arrangement allows Waymo to tap into the infrastructure and resources of Alphabet with the feel of an independent venture-backed company. He said Waymo\u2019s technology could have uses as varied as ride-sharing services and long-haul trucking, but he did not lay out a specific business strategy.Alphabet was an early technological leader in the field, but its efforts to establish a business around the technology have fallen short. Since 2009, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving cars have logged 2.3 million driverless miles \u2014 the equivalent of more than 400 round-trip drives from New York to Los Angeles \u2014 on test drives in California, Arizona, Texas and Washington state. Waymo said it completed the world\u2019s first fully driverless ride on public roads last year in Austin, Texas, with a blind passenger in a car without a steering wheel or pedals.Safely ensconced in Google\u2019s so-called moonshot factory, the self-driving car project did not face the type of financial pressure to commercialize its technology that a start-up or a company without Google\u2019s resources would have. Despite its head start, other companies have incorporated autonomous driving technology into their products and services more quickly.For Google, the goal was to design a vehicle that is responsible for 100 percent of the driving. The company said this approach was more difficult and would take more time. However, Google said it was ultimately safer than semiautonomous vehicles, which may require a driver to take back control of the car without awareness of the surroundings.Waymo said its ultimate goal was to equip its driverless system on cars without steering wheels or pedals because it didn\u2019t want humans to feel as if they needed to monitor the vehicle. However, government regulations currently require a vehicle to have steering wheels and pedals.In August 2015, Google brought in Mr. Krafcik, a former Hyundai Motor executive, to lead the project and bring it closer to commercialization. It has also lost crucial personnel on the project, sometimes to competitors.\u201cGoogle has struggled to find a way to come to market,\u201d said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where Google needs a return.\u201dThe challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesn\u2019t have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares \u2014 at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesn\u2019t have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain.It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems \u2014 akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google.This year, Google reached a deal with Fiat Chrysler to equip its automated driving systems in 100 Pacifica minivans to try to make it easier for the technology to be installed on an assembly line.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really clear that we\u2019re not a car company,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of making better cars. We\u2019re in the business of making better drivers.\u201dThe technology site The Information reported earlier that Waymo was considering building a ride-sharing network with the minivans. When asked about that possibility, Mr. Krafcik said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dIt\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s also about data. Without a way of getting its systems on the road through a ride-sharing network or an automaker, Google may struggle to collect valuable on-the-road information \u2014 a crucial part of helping its driving systems learn and improve over time.Dmitri Dolgov, who oversees the development of self-driving technology for Waymo, said the next step for his team would be to make the ride for driverless cars smoother and more natural, build out the map system to allow it to go to more places, and handle different weather conditions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking to the Future of Our Humans-First World", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The term Anthropocene is geological shorthand for a world of carbon-induced climate havoc \u2014 i.e., the world in which we now live, a world where, given the frightening pace of global warming, all bets are off. (By last summer, the hottest on record, mass coral bleaching was racing through the world\u2019s oceans, with more than 90 percent of the Great Barrier Reef already bleached.) In \u201cThe Unnatural World: The Race to Remake Civilization in Earth\u2019s Newest Age,\u201d David Biello, the science editor for TED and a contributing editor at Scientific American, sets off on a tour of our Anthropocenic world, to scout for ideas on how we might now live on a planet that our grandparents won\u2019t recognize for long. Early on, Biello visits with a paleobiologist at the University of Leicester, who tells him, bluntly, \u201cWe\u2019ve reset the Earth\u2019s biology.\u201d For some people, \u201cthat is the argument of the Anthropocene \u2014 a warning that our bad ways will quickly lead to our extinction,\u201d Biello writes. \u201cBut for others, it\u2019s a challenge. How do we make a good human epoch?\u201d\u201cThe Unnatural World\u201d is a travelogue with that good human epoch in mind, a trip around the world to meet people working out new ways for humanity to live as well as survive. At the University of Leicester, the paleobiologist describes the man-made fossils that mark human presence \u2014 the stratum of plastics, soot and radionuclides that stain the Earth everywhere from lake bottoms to mountaintops. \u201cMassive technofossils like London and Shanghai will call out to the future: Something was here!\u201d Biello writes.Indeed, the defining feature of the new world is a tangle of what we consider natural and what we don\u2019t, nature not ended but morphed. In Maryland, Biello visits a landscape ecologist who has pioneered investigations of human interactions with ecosystems, mapping various anthropogenic biomes, concluding that people are, in Biello\u2019s words, \u201cthe world\u2019s most (successful) invasive species.\u201d Biello follows along as this ecologist programs drones to monitor forests in the anthropogenic biome known as suburban Maryland, refining ways to measure and manage relatively new landscapes. \u201cThe threat is us, the solution is in us,\u201d Biello writes.He maintains a kind of upbeat morbidity while describing a database of extinct creatures\u2019 genomes, everything from mammoths to giant beavers: \u201cTough decisions have to be made about what species to save outright, what species to save for later by freezing genetic data that may come in handy, and what species to, with due respect, allow to perish, as has been the norm on this ever-changing planet for billions of years.\u201d Yet work to revive particular species inevitably comes off as the sort of hubristic scientific thinking that got us into this Anthropocene era to begin with. Biello notes complications. Say we brought back sky-darkening flocks of passenger pigeons, extinct since 1914: Would we need to revive the American chestnut trees (gone by way of an invasive fungus) that provided their food?Cities might be our greatest invention as creatures; they are where we herd, reflecting how we think, our shining hope as far as handling our own growth is concerned. How we manage the metabolic intake and output of cities is likely to determine the way that future archaeologists debate the merits of human civilization in whatever comes after the Anthropocene. To consider cities, Biello travels to China, talking to a lawyer at the local environmental protection bureau in Rizhao, a city on the Yellow Sea coast that hopes to be carbon neutral one day. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we will succeed, but we will move in that way,\u201d the lawyer says. Biello examines ways China uses waste as an energy source \u2014 America take heed, or mourn, given the Trump administration\u2019s stated attitudes toward carbon reduction \u2014 as well as the Chinese government\u2019s trade-off of shoddily built nuclear power plants for less smog.\u201cThe Unnatural World\u201d is detail-packed, almost to a fault, but a dramatic high point comes when Biello recounts how a man living in the United States (him) fares as an Anthropocenic Homo sapiens, which is either really impressive or really distressing, depending on your scruples: \u201cThe average American uses 90 kilograms of stuff each day, day in and day out. We consume 25 percent of the world\u2019s energy despite being 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. We lust for the latest gadget, which hides away minerals wrested from beneath the Congo, among other places, deep in its innards.\u201dManaging the Anthropocene, then, comes down to issues of economic inequality, and given the tech obsession in wealthier nations, it\u2019s hardly surprising that a book by a first worlder dwells on technological fixes like geoengineering. (I found myself imagining an Anthropocene that ends well when Bruce Willis in his spaceship saves us all.) In Germany, Biello meets Victor Smetacek, who attempted in 2009 to dust the Indian Ocean with 20 metric tons of iron sulfate, in the hope that proliferating plankton blooms would suck carbon from the atmosphere. He and his team were forced to turn back, for fear of plankton farming unleashing another greenhouse gas (methane), or perhaps causing an ocean dead zone. In the New Jersey Palisades, Biello inspects a carbon injection process, in which carbon dioxide is sucked from the air and pumped underground, filling sandstone crevices, a sort of reverse frack. In this case, as in most geoengineering schemes in the Anthropocene, environmental fixes beget concerns, which (perhaps) beget new fixes.Eventually, Biello winds up looking to Silicon Valley for a titanium bullet. Vinod Khosla, the billionaire who co-founded Sun Microsystems, exhorts us to seek, in Biello\u2019s words, \u201crare innovation,\u201d the kind of \u201cblack swan\u201d idea \u201cthat goes on to have extreme impact\u201d \u2014 though this is how venture capitalists think as opposed to scientists, who rely on communities of data gatherers. \u201cExperts are as good as dart-throwing monkeys,\u201d Khosla declares. Then, as if jet-lagged, Biello concludes with thoughts on Pope Francis (for his cautionary words on technology) and Elon Musk (for being Musk). \u201cWe are living in a quest that he has devised,\u201d Biello writes about Musk, \u201ceven if it isn\u2019t entirely original to him \u2014 electric cars and solar power to clean up this planet and rockets to spread life to another one.\u201dThe Tesla may not pollute Palo Alto, but the production of all its components and construction, involving graphite, lithium and cobalt mining, aren\u2019t so great for the rest of the world. We don\u2019t need rare innovations so much as old-fashioned political tools. Almost everybody knows what\u2019s going on with the climate, even the most carbon-guilty: The oil company Exxon, while dismissing scientists\u2019 evidence of climate warming, worried in the 1980s about the effect of a climate-induced rise in sea levels on its offshore rigs. Likewise, just about everybody knows that things can be changed. Biello cites London\u2019s 1821 decision to build underground sewers to stop deadly cholera outbreaks, a project that was completed in six short years.At this point, if there\u2019s any hope for a \u201cgood human epoch,\u201d it has less to do with technology than with imagining new power structures. \u201cLocal people, their voice is never heard,\u201d a China-based official with Rare, an N.G.O. that works with indigenous people, tells Biello. In the United States, the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s protest of the Dakota Access pipeline through their watershed is a good example of what stewardship might look like in the Anthropocene, and Biello touches on this when he visits the Naxi in the Yunnan Province of China. He meets a young Naxi woman who fights the government on behalf of her own local ecology, or anthropogenic biome. \u201cThe world gets better when women are empowered rather than marginalized,\u201d he writes. \u201cMore economic growth, better health, less environmental destruction all go hand in hand with free women.\u201d The roots of our cataclysm, in other words, lie in the machinery of economic and social justice. The sooner we recognize this, the sooner we can enact meaningful change.Robert Sullivan\u2019s books include \u201cThe Meadowlands,\u201d \u2009\u201cRats\u201d and \u201cThe Thoreau You Don\u2019t Know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Defies California Regulators With Self-Driving Car Service", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byFor seven years, Uber\u2019s stance on complying with regulations has been consistent: Ask forgiveness, not permission.The dispute is rooted in Uber\u2019s refusal to seek a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which would allow it to test autonomous vehicles under certain conditions. Companies like Google, Tesla Motors and Mercedes-Benz have all gotten such permits.Uber officials contend that under the letter of California law, the company does not need a permit because the motor vehicles department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive \u201cwithout the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\u201d Uber said its modified, self-driving Volvo XC90s require human oversight, and therefore do not fit California\u2019s definition of an autonomous vehicle.\u201cThis rule just doesn\u2019t apply to us,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, vice president of Uber\u2019s advanced technologies group, said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear a belt and suspenders and whatever else if you\u2019re wearing a dress.\u201dThe motor vehicles department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in a letter to Uber on Friday, lawyers in the California attorney general\u2019s office reiterated the state\u2019s position that the company pull the self-cars off the road until it got the permits or face unspecified consequences.Uber argues the way its technology is used differs little from the way Tesla Motors, the electric carmaker founded by Elon Musk, uses its technology. Tesla offers a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, which gives drivers the ability to \u201cmatch speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.As of Dec. 8, Tesla held a permit in California for autonomous-vehicle testing. Uber said that permit did not apply to the wider commercial use of self-driving cars bought by consumers, and that the motor vehicle department\u2019s decision-making process should be consistent across the types of vehicles on the road.\u201cIt\u2019s an important issue of principle about when companies can operate self-driving cars on the roads and the uneven application of statewide rules across very similar types of technology,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said.A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.Advertisement"}
