{"Headline": "Why the Computing Cloud Will Keep Growing and Growing", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, along with a couple of his rivals, may eventually control much of the $1 trillion global market for business computers and software.It\u2019s the same story at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, the other two big cloud companies. Start-ups and giant corporations rent the core resources, along with related software, instead of owning and running their own machines.What\u2019s next? As innovations like artificial intelligence and connected devices become popular, customers are putting cloud components in mobile computing, home games and email marketing campaigns. In other words, the big clouds aim to be everywhere.\u201cWhen has Amazon ever thought about anything other than world domination?\u201d said Lydia Leong, who follows cloud computing at Gartner. Not content to be in big centralized data centers, she said, \u201cthey want to be at the edges, whether that is a customer\u2019s own computers or the Internet of Things.\u201dThis aim for domination was clear at Amazon\u2019s big customer conference, called Re:Invent, which was held in Las Vegas this month. About 32,000 people went to the fourth annual event.In one talk at the conference, an Amazon Web Services executive showed off the company\u2019s 8,700-mile undersea cable, part of an A.W.S. global network that each day adds computing power equal to that inside a Fortune 500 corporation, and spoke about this expansion. He talked about crushing the costs of servers and networking, most likely sad news for old tech giants that make those things, like Dell and Cisco.In a nice bit of showmanship during the main keynote, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., appeared onstage with an 18-wheel truck carrying a device that could suck 100 petabytes of data out of a customer\u2019s computers and put it in the Amazon cloud. That is equal to two billion filing cabinets of paper, which a surprising number of companies now possess in digital form, thanks to things like video and sensors.Put that together with some software Mr. Jassy talked about that would be on chips made by Intel but capable of gaining access to the A.W.S. cloud, and you get the picture: There isn\u2019t a part of computing Amazon doesn\u2019t want to touch.Amazon says it is hardly moving away from a core business of providing large-scale computing, but rather finding more ways to sell stuff related to it by moving to edge devices.\u201cWe see it less as a move from one to the other, and more of an extension,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Camarata, wrote in an email Saturday. \u201cWe have an enormous number of customers excited about leveraging the capabilities.\u201dMachine learning \u2014 a method for computers to gain knowledge without being programmed with that information \u2014 is front and center for Alphabet\u2019s Google, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, the head of technical infrastructure at Google Compute. Google has recently shown off its own global network of submarine cables, along with local devices like cloud-connected office whiteboards. Over the next year, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said, Google will open about one new Compute facility a month.Building out across the globe, with sometimes $1 billion or more in a facility, is critical in some cases to meet local data regulations. Equally, the big cloud companies all want to be as close to customers and their devices as possible.\u201cGlobal proximity is a huge advantage,\u201d said Corey Sanders, the director of program management at Azure. \u201cThis is a way to transform your business, including the way devices on the edge act.\u201dThere are profound consequences from the scale and ambition of this trend. Given their size, wealth and technical expertise, the big cloud companies are likely to build cheaper designs and demand lower prices for everything in computing. Who is to say they don\u2019t affect the devices themselves?That is starting to dawn on the rest of the industry. On the first day of Re:Invent, Mr. Jassy had a private lunch with about 10 venture capitalists. It is an annual affair, where he indicates where A.W.S. is going, and they figure out how to make money from it.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t explicit, but if you were hoping to invest in storage, computing \u2014 anything below applications \u2014 you are hosed,\u201d said Dharmesh Thakker, a partner at Battery Ventures, who attended the lunch. \u201cAndy is smart and approachable, but reading between the lines, I\u2019m not sure this is good for the V.C. ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ads Show Up on Breitbart and Brands Blame Technology", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThe Vanguard Group does its best to stay away from politics when advertising, going so far as to have a policy against marketing on overtly partisan websites. So it was a surprise to Vanguard, an investment management company, when it found its ads on Breitbart News, the hard-right site that has become closely tied to President-elect Donald J. Trump.An email from a client alerted Vanguard to the issue last week, prompting it to pull its ads from the site. Breitbart had been inadvertently included on a list of preapproved websites the company and its ad agency use to try to reach people who have visited Vanguard\u2019s site, said Emily Farrell, a spokeswoman.Vanguard is one of at least a dozen companies, including prominent brands like Allstate, Kellogg and Warby Parker, that have said recently that they will stop advertising on Breitbart. The brands have attributed their appearances on the site to the automated nature of online advertising, in which a complicated system of third-party networks and agencies is used to place ads. That has cast a spotlight on how the zeal to capitalize on consumer data and advanced targeting technologies has resulted in some companies\u2019 being associated with sites they want to avoid.It is increasingly rare for marketers and their agencies to place ads directly on websites. Unlike advertising on television or in magazines, where brands often choose placements in advance based on content, marketers online deploy sophisticated technologies to target and personalize ads in real time for the people who are most likely to be interested in their products or services, wherever they may be roaming on the web.Kris Charles, a Kellogg representative, said that while the company reviewed sites for potential ad placements \u201cusing filtering technology to assess the words and phrases that make up a site\u2019s content,\u201d there is also \u201ca very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed.\u201dA spokeswoman for Breitbart did not respond to requests for comment for this article.The nuances of how a brand ends up on a website, however, are often meaningless to consumers who may associate the two regardless of whether they have a direct relationship \u2014 which is being highlighted anew as tensions run high after the election.Workable\u2019s ad ended up on the site through one of the Google companies that brokers web ads, and Workable has now added Breitbart to an \u201copt out\u201d list, Mr. Moraitakis said in an interview. But even as it has blocked Breitbart, \u201cthere\u2019s probably another 10 sites we haven\u2019t excluded,\u201d he said.\u201cWe rely on our ad networks to keep the networks clean, and then obviously, the big ethical question is what clean means,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, these hate speech sites and fake news sites are a new breed, and I don\u2019t think Google has caught on to them.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe unfortunate side effect of this is that to the consumer, it looks like we are directing our advertising dollars to a specific media site.\u201dMost ads are placed based on data about the user rather than the content of the website, and limits are set after the fact \u2014 say, ensuring that brands do not show up next to pornography or neo-Nazi literature. This process is known as blacklisting, and because of the sheer number of websites, brands tend to value its efficiency over any qualms they may have about appearing in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201cThe blacklist approach starts with 500 billion impressions a day across the globe in real time across all screens and all formats; the white list approach starts with zero,\u201d said Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, a marketing technology company. \u201cSo it\u2019s, do you start with the universe, then filter, or start with nothing, then build up?\u201dTo some, that illustrates the underlying problem. Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said that while audience profile \u201cmatters first and foremost,\u201d there \u201chas to be a better standard set for the environment\u201d where an ad will appear.\u201cWhen you buy so many sites that you don\u2019t know them all, there\u2019s almost no way to kind of guarantee you\u2019re not going to be supporting something fraudulent, sensationalist or alt-right or whatever the content happens to be,\u201d he said.The uproar about Breitbart with the separate issue of fake news sites has sent advertisers to online ad verification companies like DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. On Thursday, DoubleVerify added an \u201cInflammatory Politics & News\u201d category to a list of more than 75 categories that advertisers can choose to avoid. If selected, it will block ads from appearing on sites including Breitbart, Rawstory.com, WND.com, LibertyWritersNews.com and YoungCons.com, the company said.\u201cWith the surge in these new sites that are living on unsubstantiated stories that are oftentimes very politically charged, large brands are coming to us and ensuring that their ads don\u2019t appear on those kinds of sites,\u201d said Wayne Gattinella, the chief executive of DoubleVerify.Still, John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at the advertising giant WPP\u2019s GroupM, predicts that the price of ads on Breitbart could decline, affecting the company\u2019s revenue, if enough \u201cvenerable brands\u201d act.\u201cSince the Breitbart issue came up, we\u2019ve obviously been talking to our people internationally and making sure they have their clients understand if they don\u2019t want to be on political sites, we need to put them onto the blacklist,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said in an interview. \u201cParticularly after the publicity of the election there are many big brands who are having these discussions with agencies right now.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of an online ad verification company. It is DoubleVerify, not DoubleVarify.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Start-up employees and leaders actively seek to question authority and think outside the box \u2014 two attributes widely discouraged in corporate China.\u201cI was having difficulty finding a partner who specializes on the technology side,\u201d said Mr. Yao, who estimated that he watched the movie more than 10 times in 2013 and 2014. \u201cI started to wonder how people in \u2018The Pirates of Silicon Valley\u2019 found their partners. So I watched the film over and over and learned a lot from it.\u201dAt times China seems to embrace Silicon Valley clich\u00e9s more eagerly than Silicon Valley itself.A prominent techie cafe in Beijing has a large wall with a timeline charting the initial public stock offerings of American tech companies alongside those in China. Some companies have created Apple-style product unveilings that are ticketed, cultural events. A developer in China is planning to start work on \u201ctech towns\u201d \u2014 planned communities where the innovative-minded can live and work together. Start-up offices often have open seating plans with office pets, foosball tables and a boss sitting with the employees.\u201cSilicon Valley has become a kind of beacon of cultural change in China,\u201d said David Chao, a partner at the venture capital firm DCM. \u201cHollywood could impact what kind of handbag a lady buys in China, but it never impacted corporate culture like Silicon Valley has.\u201dEven so, most Chinese companies have not fully absorbed the culture. Many are still highly top-down and bureaucratic, and open office plans often mask more deeply conservative customs. In place of California\u2019s sunny suburbs, China\u2019s innovation hub sits in the traffic and smog-choked northwestern part of Beijing, crammed into office towers above malls that sell all manner of electronics.The trend is nonetheless driving young people to take more risks and demand more from employers, even as it brings with it a problem familiar to Silicon Valley: hangers-on more interested in being a part of the scene than anything else.\u201cThere are people choosing technology not because they love it or want to do a start-up,\u201d said Jesse Lu, a Chinese entrepreneur who spent time at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up accelerator in the United States. \u201cThey just do it because they enjoy the lifestyle of a start-up. They enjoy choosing their hours, having small teams, not listening to anybody, doing what they think is right. It\u2019s a new fashion.\u201dSilicon Valley seems largely unaware of its cultural influence in China and appears to do little to cater to it.Last year, Facebook fired an enterprising Chinese employee who played to the unmet demand and charged one group of tourists $20 each to tour the campus and eat in the company\u2019s cafeteria. Now, the only thing notable for tourists to see is its thumbs-up sign.In Mountain View, Mr. Zhao and the tour group snapped photos of a cluster of brightly painted plaster statues designed after various Google corporate mascots. Next door is Google\u2019s visitor store, a sort of swag graveyard set up in converted office space where the company sells all manner of clothes and trinkets \u2014 including Frisbees and water bottles \u2014 imprinted with the Google logo.\u201cThey used to not let our buses on the campus, but now they built this area where we can come and take pictures,\u201d said Ken Guan, the leader of the tour group.\u201cPeople are surprised,\u201d he added. \u201cThey think it will be a booming commercial area, but it\u2019s just a bunch of offices.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning Your Vacation Photos Into Works of Art", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayIt\u2019s the season for family travel and photos \u2014 and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home.I recently sent some ho-hum quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I\u2019d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. I\u2019ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation, then with a clutter-free home.Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art, I was most interested in trying engineer prints, named for the large, lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can make huge enlargements. Mind you, it\u2019s a particular aesthetic, one that\u2019s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial, shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape, a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints; or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while, engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white, but now you can find them in color, too.The site\u2019s engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet, and cost $20 in black and white, and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white, and they came out, to my surprise, beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch.I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34.99, a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon \u2014 not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less), but you\u2019re printing on special material. Regardless of the cost, I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls, after all), but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo \u2014 crevasses in a glacier; onlookers on a bridge \u2014 were nicely defined.SnapBox is a user-friendly site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters, it also offers fine art prints, photo books and prints on canvas and pillows.Once you\u2019ve turned the best of your travel photos into art, it\u2019s time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space, there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives, slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind.In general, these sites are a pain to navigate. They\u2019re cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options \u2014 Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned? \u2014 that if you don\u2019t have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead, be sure to select that option (if it\u2019s offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware, too, that it\u2019s not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries, so it can take weeks to get your images back.First things first: These are not professional-quality scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration, then go with a professional. However if, like me, you have a bunch of travel photos \u2014 landscapes, food, monuments \u2014 that you\u2019re keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when, you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150.By and large, PhotoScan is simple and quick, with almost no learning curve. If you try it, just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Don\u2019t tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want top-notch prints or have thousands of photos to scan.Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely Zen-like activity. That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again. And you can\u2019t beat the price.Stephanie Rosenbloom is The Getaway columnist for the Travel section.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Resolutions to Simplify Your Tech Life", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byIn 2017, why not try a new kind of New Year\u2019s resolution? Instead of just hitting the gym and dropping some pounds, consider changing some personal habits to simplify the tech in your life.If you are like most people, there are things you do with tech that could use some tweaking. Strengthening your password security, for one, would benefit you tremendously in an era when hacks are rampant. For another, purging the e-junk you have accumulated over the years would help the environment and your sanity. While you\u2019re at it, start doing maintenance on your electronics to make sure they work smoothly this year.P.U. \u2014 what\u2019s that smell? It\u2019s your bad password hygiene. You are probably using the same password across multiple websites for banking, shopping, social media and email. Then add an extra layer of protection by enabling two-factor verification on your accounts whenever the option is available. When you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before logging in.Taking these two simple steps will help safeguard you from the inevitable hacks that arise this year.Do this basic maintenance every six months and your devices will run smoothly for many years. We don\u2019t hesitate to buy new smartphones every two years \u2014 but that neglected, ugly Wi-Fi router tucked away in the corner of the living room may be the most important tech product to upgrade every few years. Among all tech headaches, there is nothing more annoying than a sluggish, spotty internet connection.Start off each new year by doing some checks on your internet infrastructure. If your router is more than three years old, you probably need a new one that is compatible with today\u2019s faster, smarter wireless standards. If you are relying on a router provided by your broadband provider, you should probably buy a more powerful stand-alone router. Unused gadgets and power cables take up lots of space in drawers and attics. This e-waste would be better off sold or donated to someone in need, or recycled for their precious metals. There is bound to be unsellable e-junk in your pile. Fortunately, all Best Buy locations will take your used electronics and recycle them for free. Just bag the items up and drop them off at the store\u2019s customer-service counter, and the retailer will take care of the rest.Many deals that emerge throughout the year are as good, or better, than the ones on Black Friday. You just have to know how to spot them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Inspiration for Art in the Betrayal of Privacy", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyLast month, a Berlin nonprofit group called the Tactical Technology Collective took over a gallery in Lower Manhattan. They installed wall-size screens and display cases and arranged glossy tablets on large tables. The walls were white, and the d\u00e9cor was minimalist. If you squinted, you could mistake it for an Apple Store. That was the point. The exhibit, which Mozilla helped produce, lured people in with the visual language of high-tech consumption. But instead of housing cool new devices, each display contained an artifact or a piece of art intended to school and shock visitors on how much (or little) we know about privacy and data security.There was an interactive demonstration on a widely used program called \u201cChurchix,\u201d a facial-recognition tool licensed to churches that records and logs the identities of people entering the premises. There was a book created by the artist Aram Bartholl of the five million passwords stolen in 2012 from LinkedIn (including my own), so thoroughly thumbed through that the spine had broken. A piece by Mimi Onuoha, \u201cThe Library of Missing Data Sets,\u201d showed a filing cabinet packed with information not readily available online, under headings like \u201cNumber of Mosques Surveilled by F.B.I.\u201d and \u201cN.S.F.W. Comments Trump Made While Filming \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\u2009\u201d It commented on the political implications of the knowledge we don\u2019t have access to \u2014 despite living in the age of on-demand information.Eight antennas collected information emitted by any Wi-Fi-enabled device that happened to wander past the gallery and beamed it to an enormous screen inside, a disturbing reminder of how easy it is to track people and how often we let it happen. My favorite display was a fitness band tied to a metronome, exactly the kind you would use to practice music. Called an UnFitbit, the low-fi hack was intended to help clever individuals goose their daily fitness scores. It seemed cute, the idea that you might want to cheat on how many steps you took in a day, but the display had a darker interpretation: It anticipated a future when insurance rates and health benefits might be tied to such rankings.To move through the Glass Room, as the exhibition was called, was to be reminded of the many ways we unwittingly submit ourselves and one another to unnecessary surveillance, with devastating consequences. \u201cA few years ago, everything here would be a \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 episode, but it is real,\u201d says Marek Tuszynski, a founder of the Tactical Technology Collective, which also does privacy and digital rights advocacy work. He told me that since the election, Americans have seemed more eager to protect their data. \u201cThere is a newfound urgency here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to feel like they have to stop using Facebook or their mobile phones, but we just want them to look at it differently.\u201dI left the Glass Room invigorated by the ways artists are exploring the dark side of our digital footprint. Artists\u2019 obsessions with technology are not new, but in the late aughts, the work tended to focus on the possibility of the medium, treating technology like a new tool rather than a sociopolitical framework. Browser hacks scrambled web pages, turning them into distorted images, and Facebook-oriented projects treated the platform\u2019s design as Dadaist.\u201cIt was that early millennial era, when the 20-somethings were defining their generation by its use of technology and social media without raising questions about privacy, data or corporate power,\u201d says Joanne McNeil, an artist and a writer who often tackles topics relating to the intersection of art and technology. Her theory is that because many artists \u2014 all of us, really \u2014 were so captivated by the initial promise of the internet, they were blinded to its potential problems. \u201cI think because it was so much a networking tool \u2014 they were friending curators, other artists \u2014 Facebook seemed necessary, rather than an institution to distract or antagonize.\u201dIn the earlier part of this decade, I myself fell prey to a similar infatuation. Technology impressed me so much that I didn\u2019t consider its implications. I remember once driving in 2007 out to Pacifica State Beach in California and spotting a billboard that advertised a free business directory from Google. Later that day, during a slow spell at the restaurant where I waitressed, I tried it. You dialed GOOG-411, and an automated service located the number you needed \u2014 a hotel, a home, a nail salon \u2014 and dialed it for you. It\u2019s hard to explain how impressive this was back then. Before smartphones and unlimited data plans became ubiquitous, GOOG-411 was an ingenious life saver, especially because it was free (its alternative, dialing 411, sometimes cost $2 or more per request). Google engineers were also using the service to help build a library of human sounds, in order to refine the company\u2019s speech-recognition system. Helping to build a robot seemed unbelievably cool at the time. But that was nearly 10 years ago, before I knew about all the ways in which seemingly innocuous data collection can turn insidious, how programs not so different from that directory have given rise to predictive policing, algorithmic biases and unthinkable privacy breaches.Each day, it seems, we now learn about some new way our supposedly locked-down information is being leaked \u2014 as happened recently at Yahoo, which lost control of millions of passwords. Terms of agreement are updated with disturbing details in the fine print. The maker of the note-taking application Evernote, for example, recently sent out a notice to its millions of users that its engineers would be looking at their data to improve its services. Although there was a way to opt out, the company warned that doing so could compromise future services. The outcry against the change forced the company to reconsider.Artists now seem to be tangling with and reflecting these dark undertones in their work. Roddy Schrock, the director of Eyebeam, a space for new media, recently noted in an interview with an art blog how artists have changed their approach. \u201cEyebeam was born at a time, in the late \u201990s, when thinking around technology was na\u00efve and utopian,\u201d he said. \u201cI think much current thought around technology is still na\u00efve, but no one even pretends that the outcomes will be utopic now.\u201dThat lack of pretending is now readily apparent. Friends of mine who attended Art Basel in Miami posted photographs of works like the \u201cSocial Security Cameras\u201d by Fidia Falaschetti, a series of security cameras whose outer casings had been replaced with the candy-colored logos of companies like Twitter, Google, Snapchat and Instagram. The cameras were a chilling reflection of our documentation-obsessed times, how our need for validation usurps our desire for privacy and the protection of personal information. Also at Basel was the work of a Shanghai artist who uses the handle Aaajiao, who installed a machine that printed out lists of websites blocked by China\u2019s firewall, reflecting the limits of the online experience in the country.And the New Jersey-based artist Sondra Perry recently had an incredible show in the Kitchen, a Chelsea performance space, called \u201cResident Evil\u201d that mixed video-game perspectives with bodycam and news footage that pushed visitors to think about how black bodies survive despite the threats posed by surveillance. Perry told an interviewer that she was invested in understanding how the power structures that govern the internet \u2014 which has essentially become a group of corporations \u2014 was shaping our sense of self and autonomy. \u201cWhen we think that we are trying to express ourselves, and we\u2019re being individuals,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re being individuals within a frame that is primarily to collect our data and sell us stuff.\u201dArtists have long urged cultural introspection by creating work that forces awareness of our current political and economic landscape. A clip of Nina Simone speaking about art\u2019s power as activism has been floating around the web more vigorously than usual in the last few months. In it, Simone has an air of urgency. \u201cAn artist\u2019s duty, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is to reflect the times,\u201d she says. She continues: \u201cWe will shape and mold this country, or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.\u201d Art has the ability to be a mirror, reflecting back to us the world as it is, even if we\u2019re not ready to see it. Artists like Perry, Falaschetti and Onuoha are trying to awaken us from our complacency, pushing us to look beyond the blinding dazzle of our devices.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jurors Hear Dylann Roof Explain Shooting in Video: \u2018I Had to Do It\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Shortly after being arrested and about 17 hours after he shot up the fellowship hall at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Dylann S. Roof sat at an oval conference table with two F.B.I. agents and confessed \u2014 calmly, clinically, occasionally chortling \u2014 to killing nine people who he acknowledged could not have been more innocent.Mr. Roof, 21 at the time, told the agents he was astonished to find the church parking lot not swarming with police when he exited a side door at 9:06 p.m. on June 17, 2015. He said he had saved one of eight magazines for his Glock semiautomatic handgun, loaded with hollow-point bullets bought at Walmart, so he could kill himself if confronted by the police.Given that many mass killers do take their own lives, or are shot dead by the police, Mr. Roof\u2019s extensive interview offered a rare courtroom glimpse deep into the mind of someone accused of such a rampage.Mr. Roof answered the agents\u2019 questions eagerly in a matter-of-fact tone, his voice deeper than might be expected from his boyish appearance. He did not so much express remorse as depict his actions as necessary to retaliate for what he perceived as an epidemic of black-on-white crime.\u201cI regret doing it a little bit,\u201d he said, before the agents revealed to him the body count, which Mr. Roof had guessed was perhaps four or five. Once they did, and prompted him for his reaction, he said, \u201cIt makes me feel bad,\u201d but there was little emotion in his voice. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m glad I did it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done it, so\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cI had to do it.\u201dWhen one of the agents asked if he hoped to be a martyr, he answered, \u201cWell, that would be nice, sure, but I didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s what would happen.\u201dThe two-hour interview took place at a police station in Shelby, N.C., where Mr. Roof had been arrested without incident the morning after the killings. He had been freed of his handcuffs and fortified with a Burger King hamburger provided by the Shelby officers.The racial rationale Mr. Roof provided to two F.B.I. agents, Michael E. Stansbury and Craig Januchowski, closely resembled the online manifesto he is alleged to have written shortly before the killings and a journal found afterward in his car. \u201cWell I had to do it because somebody had to do something because, you know, black people are killing white people every day on the streets, and they rape white women, 100 white women a day,\u201d he told the agents. \u201cThe fact of the matter is what I did is so minuscule to what they\u2019re doing to white people every day, all the time.\u201dMr. Roof, who noted the declining influence of hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, said, \u201cNobody else is brave enough to do anything about it.\u201dIn the courtroom, Mr. Roof, dressed in a gray cable-knit sweater, sometimes leafed through papers at the defense table as the grainy video recording played on several screens.He also made it clear that the Wednesday night Bible study session provided an easy target. \u201cWell it\u2019s like this, you see, I\u2019m not in the position, you know, by myself, you know, to go into like a black neighborhood, you know, or something like that and shoot up, you know, drug dealers or something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying? That\u2019s not going to do anything. You see what I\u2019m saying. I had to go somewhere else.\u201dMr. Roof said he hoped his attack would agitate race relations and awaken white Americans to the notion that they are \u201csecond-class citizens.\u201d He said his \u201cracial awareness\u201d had been inspired by a Google search of the phrase \u201cblack on white crime\u201d after the reaction to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black 17-year-old, by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. \u201dThat was it,\u201d he said.Prosecutors and defense lawyers are introducing scores of exhibits in the federal trial of Dylann S. Roof, the self-avowed white supremacist who is accused of killing nine black people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Although the judge has forbidden the release of some exhibits, such as certain crime scene photographs, he has allowed many to be made public beyond the courtroom.He said that while sitting silently through the Bible study, his weapon and ammunition concealed in a fanny pack, he considered not going through with his plan. \u201cI could have walked out,\u201d he said, \u201cand you know, that\u2019s just what I was thinking, but then I just like, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to say spur of the moment, but, you know, I just finally decided I had to do it.\u201dHe had no co-conspirators, Mr. Roof said, and he was under the influence of nothing stronger than a few swigs of vodka. Neither he nor his family had ever been victimized by African-Americans, he said. He told the agents he was trying not to think about either the dead churchgoers or how his parents might react.When the agents pushed him to declare his guilt, he chuckled. \u201cI am guilty,\u201d he blurted. \u201cWe all know I\u2019m guilty.\u201dThe jury of 18, including six alternates, heard Mr. Roof\u2019s confession a day after prosecutors put before them a stark juxtaposition of images: first a series of videos captured by the church\u2019s security cameras of the victims entering the church in their last hours alive, ending with Mr. Roof\u2019s arrival, then a grisly series of crime scene photographs of the devastation inside the fellowship hall.A final scene from the security camera showed Mr. Roof exiting the church\u2019s side door, holding the Glock at his right side and driving off in his black Hyundai Elantra.Two days after the shooting, state investigators examined the car and found handwritten letters to Mr. Roof\u2019s parents.\u201cI know that what I did will have repercussions on my whole family,\u201d he wrote to his mother, \u201cand for this, I truly am sorry.\u201d He added, \u201cAt this moment, I miss you very much and as childish as it sounds, I wish I was in your arms.\u201dOn the first day of the trial, medics took a woman away from the courthouse in an ambulance. It was Mr. Roof\u2019s mother, Amelia Cowles, and defense lawyers, in a court filing on Thursday, said she had a heart attack. There has been no word on her condition.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated when the photo of the police officer at the church was taken. It was in June 2015, not this week.Advertisement"}

By collectively tracking that information, the companies said they could make sure a video posted on Twitter, for instance, did not appear later on Facebook.\u201cThroughout this collaboration, we are committed to protecting our users\u2019 privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms,\u201d the companies said in a statement. They added they were discussing other ways \u201cto prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.\u201dThrough the coalition, technology companies will use \u201chashes,\u201d or what they describe as \u201cunique digital fingerprints,\u201d to identify terrorist imagery and videos uploaded to their services.So if a Twitter post with a terrorist image is identified, hashed and added to the database, Facebook can use that identifier to check to see if that content appears on its network. If it has, Facebook can remove that piece of content from its site if it chooses to do so.Technology companies generally remove content that has been flagged as inappropriate or a violation of their terms of service. Each company will ultimately have discretion over what content it removes from its own network. No personally identifiable information will be stored in the database.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Condemns the Wrong Man", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byDealBookShe took aim at an individual she described as a \u201chedge fund billionaire\u201d who is \u201cthrilled by Donald Trump\u2019s economic team of Wall Street insiders.\u201dThe hedge fund manager she condemned was Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital. Ms. Warren \u2014 the fiery Massachusetts Democrat who is known for her stern mistrust of Wall Street \u2014 called him out by saying, \u201cTilson knows that, despite all the stunts and rhetoric, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to change the economic system.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe next four years are going to be a bonanza for the Whitney Tilsons of the world.\u201dThere\u2019s one rather glaring problem with Ms. Warren\u2019s attack: Mr. Tilson happens to be one of the few financial executives who publicly fought Mr. Trump\u2019s election and supported Hillary Clinton. A lifelong Democrat who was involved in helping to start Teach for America, Mr. Tilson also happened to be one of the rare Wall Street executives who had donated to Ms. Warren and actively sought new regulations for the industry. Recently, he gave Mrs. Clinton $1,000 so he could see Ms. Warren speak at a campaign fund-raiser. (He\u2019s also far, far from a billionaire.)Ms. Warren appears to be suffering from the same affliction that Mr. Trump\u2019s critics accuse of him: a knee-jerk, fact-free reaction to something she had read in the news.In this case, Ms. Warren seems to have come across a Bloomberg News article that includes some quotations from Mr. Tilson. But she didn\u2019t read to the bottom or dismissed it before firing off her zingers.The part Ms. Warren may have missed toward the bottom was this: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Dodd-Frank, I think banking should be boring,\u201d he was quoted as saying, where he was also identified as a Clinton supporter. \u201cI worry about Wall Street returning to being a casino.\u201dIn fairness, depending on how you look at the situation, it is possible some readers and supporters of Ms. Warren will give her kudos for criticizing one of her own well-heeled donors. \u201cShe can\u2019t be bought,\u201d might be a generous way to consider the situation. But even a quick Google search of Mr. Tilson\u2019s involvement in the recent political discourse over financial reform would reveal what he clearly meant by his quotation: that he was nervous about Mr. Trump appointing reckless and uninformed people to guide financial policy and that he was heartened that he had not.As Ms. Warren has made clear, she abhors the idea of anyone who has worked in the financial industry working in government on policy that could affect the economy and Wall Street. This column has covered what I\u2019ve described as her misguided view.That\u2019s not to say any administration wouldn\u2019t benefit from bringing in some outsiders who could offer new and different perspectives, but that can\u2019t be a qualifying measure. The next time you need heart surgery, do you want to go to a heart surgeon or a psychologist?In fairness, Ms. Warren\u2019s ambitious efforts to overhaul financial regulation are not without merit: There are large parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that have done a ton of good to protect the American public. She played a hugely important role recently in grilling the chief executive of Wells Fargo about his bank\u2019s sham-accounts scandal, and her questioning appears to have helped bring about his resignation. And at a time when one party is in power \u2014 in this case, the Republicans \u2014 Ms. Warren\u2019s position is even more important to help hold our leaders accountable.However, her ad hominem attack on Mr. Tilson only serves to undermine her credibility and some of the good work she wants to achieve.To make matters worse, Mr. Tilson\u2019s wife, Susan Blackman Tilson, was one of the students in the first Harvard Law School bankruptcy class that Ms. Warren taught, in fall 1992. The student has remained loyal to her professor; Mrs. Tilson wrote in a letter to Ms. Warren last week that she had been \u201ccheering from the sidelines as you rose to national attention for your excellent work on behalf of consumers.\u201dBoth of the Tilsons sent letters to Ms. Warren last week, which they shared with me, seeking to set the record straight and asking her to remove her Facebook post.The response? An aide emailed them: \u201cShe asked me to relay to you that she is removing the word \u2018billionaire\u2019 from the post, as you have indicated that is factually inaccurate. The senator has decided, however, not to remove the overall post.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Warren declined to comment on the exchange.When I spoke to Mr. Tilson on Monday, he said he felt that the senator had let him down in two ways: \u201cPersonally, I feel betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent years, I\u2019ve really stuck my neck out by very publicly supporting her, the C.F.P.B., and a tough regulatory approach to banks \u2014 none of which wins me many friends \u2014 and this is how she repays me.\u201dMr. Tilson added: \u201cBy engaging in factually incorrect, ad hominem attacks, she\u2019s getting down into the gutter with Trump. This is misguided and counterproductive.\u201dDespite all of that, he said, \u201cI still support her because I share her belief that banking should be boring.\u201dNaturally enough, he added, her Facebook post, coupled with her response, \u201ccertainly reduces my enthusiasm for her.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Syria, With Love", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byModern LoveSecretly, irrationally, I already loved them. I loved them the way you love a future spouse you imagine for yourself, or how you love your children before they take root in your body and heart. These were people searching for safety, much as my Hungarian ancestors had tried to do in the 1930s before they were taken to concentration camps.At the mere mention of this family\u2019s existence, a kernel of worry and hope began to spin inside of me. And what is that if not the stirrings of love?I cleaned the refrigerator with bleach and picked crumbs out of a seal with a toothpick. My son and daughter, 10 and 5, brushed away cobwebs and wiped baseboards, while my husband tackled the bathroom. With the volunteers from the co-sponsoring church, my pagan family stripped the apartment of its errant Polaroids and refrigerator magnets until it became neutral, spare, a place of refuge.As the date neared, I thought of the empty refrigerator, reeking of bleach, and the cabinets, lined but bare, and took to Facebook with a plea for basics.The packages that began arriving on my porch daily were a salve protecting me from the increasing ugliness of the presidential campaign. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d I whispered as my PayPal account grew with money earmarked for food, diversions and educational materials.One donation labeled \u201cFor our Syrian friends\u201d was blocked as suspicious, and my heart raged. Then the donor tried \u201cFor our friends,\u201d and the donation sailed through. \u201cWe\u2019re stepping over you,\u201d I whispered to the electronic gatekeepers.My neighbor and I went to the international market with a downloaded grocery list. She has a Southern accent, blond children and a husband who throws baseballs in the street at dusk. Here we were buying Turkish coffee, dried beans, orange blossom water and Persian cucumbers.I posted photos of our grocery cart, and in came more donations.I went to Walmart with my children, where they helped me pick out a toy electric keyboard, art supplies, chalk and potted plants.On our porch, our neighbors left stuffed animals, bedsheets, pans and cutlery. We filled the apartment with all the things we hoped would telegraph our collective message: You are welcome here.While we cleaned and shopped, the family was being interviewed and inoculated in preparation for travel as refugees to the United States. We learned their names and ages. The father and mother, 36 and 28, were parents to a daughter and son, 11 and 9. Years earlier, they had left Syria on foot, with nothing, for Jordan. They had no idea anyone would be here to welcome them.On the day they arrived, we greeted them with a phrase we had memorized, \u201cAhlan wa sahlan\u201d: \u201cWelcome.\u201d They greeted us with a word they had memorized: \u201cHello.\u201dI showed them how to work the stovetop, the oven and the dishwasher. They smiled, bowing their heads. The mother, Ruwaida, looked like a woman who, after spending four years in limbo, had flown through the night from one country to another only to find herself in an apartment in yet another foreign city with strangers.\u201cHow long can we stay?\u201d she asked the translator.\u201cOne year in the apartment, for free,\u201d he said.She slumped with joy and relief. On the floor, two black suitcases contained all they owned.Every few days, I showed up with more donated items. At night, I read about Islam until I fell asleep.They learned \u201cthank you\u201d and taught me its Arabic counterpart, \u201cshukran.\u201d We were all like toddlers when it came to language, with maybe 20 words among us.I brought them over-the-counter medicines, Band-Aids, a thermometer and lunchboxes. My phone was filled with notes: rain coats, flashlight, toilet paper. I scoured my Facebook feed to find others who were helping refugees, kind people who answered my every question. Nawara, an Arabic speaker from Denver, offered me her cellphone number and, despite our time difference, told me to text whenever I needed a translation.Eventually the family received a cellphone, and I started getting messages in Arabic that said \u201cwelcome,\u201d and began to recognize these as invitations to visit. So I did. As Ruwaida and her husband, Khaled, and I spoke into our phones to say the simplest things, their son, Mohammad, and daughter, Zainab, slapped each other with pool noodles in the yard.We often shook our heads, trying to stop the robotic translator voice from communicating some errant interpretation: \u201cI can\u2019t think of the word\u201d becoming \u201cI can\u2019t think of the George.\u201d We learned to be patient.I started dropping by regularly, always arriving with something in my hands, my American fears of showing up unannounced now allayed. I took them to the pool and offered Zainab a long-sleeve pink leotard and tights with the feet cut off that I had bought in a panic when I realized our swimwear would not be culturally appropriate.She held the outfit, uncertain. The spandex material looked so small. But when she emerged from the bathroom (looking like a stretched piece of pink gum), she smiled broadly. I hadn\u2019t realized how malnourished she was, her ribs and hips protruding. I wondered if her parents would allow her to go off like that, not fully covered. But Khaled, in my husband\u2019s swim trunks, gave a big thumbs up, and off we went.When Zainab developed a persistent cough, I consulted the church sponsorship coordinator about how she was looking, what she was eating, and we debated taking her to urgent care. He and I functioned like amicable former spouses, working out the details of the lives we jointly cared about.When the church coordinator called to tell me that Khaled had received an urgent message from a doctor saying he might have internal bleeding, my husband took him to the hospital, where they befriended a family who spoke Arabic and found a lead on a restaurant job.After five hours in the waiting room, with Khaled insisting he felt fine, a doctor finally drew his blood. It wasn\u2019t until weeks later that we learned the call was a clerical error. Khaled asked if this happened a lot here, and I said: \u201cNo. You\u2019re special.\u201d He laughed.It was the first time humor had translated, the first time our communication had been elevated from the transactional.One night, my husband\u2019s cellphone began collecting urgent texts from his mother and sisters as we slept: His father, an Indian immigrant, had become gravely ill during a visit to his home country. We discussed the pros and cons of my husband\u2019s going, and then his phone rang: Things were getting worse. So he went.The next night, I was alone and terrified, giving my daughter a bath, when Khaled texted me. He was wondering why I had not come to visit them in the past two days.I told him everything, filtering my message through Google Translate and then copying the result into a text. I told him I was sad and scared. My mother was dead. My father hadn\u2019t been in my life for years. My father-in-law meant everything to me, and now I might lose him, too. My husband was across the ocean following an ambulance from one hospital to another, thinking, \u201cGo fast,\u201d \u201cBe well\u201d and \u201cPlease.\u201dI knew the poor translation would be hard for him to understand, but I needed to say all of that, even if in the curlicue of Arabic. And somehow he did understand. He sent me prayers, kind words.I said, \u201cThank you,\u201d when I really meant, \u201cI am so grateful to have your family on the other end of this phone.\u201d He said, \u201cThank you too much,\u201d which I took to mean, \u201cWe are so grateful to be here for you.\u201dOne day, I stopped by their house when one of the Arabic-speaking parishioners was visiting. While my friend Nawara had been wonderful in clearing up our miscommunications after the fact, we hadn\u2019t had the luxury of an in-person translator.Ruwaida served cookies as Khaled prepared coffee. The air smelled of cardamom. The parishioner translated information about medical cards and appointments, school lunches and English classes. And then Khaled asked her to translate a message to me.She listened until he had finished. Then she turned my way and said: \u201cWhen we left Syria, we left everyone we loved. We came here with no family. Even if you come to our home with nothing in your hands, we are happy to see you. You are our family now.\u201dTo hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Hobbles Through a Cash Crisis, and Electronic Payments Boom", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byMr. Mandal is among millions of Indians \u2014 snack vendors and rickshaw drivers, cobblers and coconut-water sellers \u2014 who are moving swiftly toward a cashless economy, fulfilling what Prime Minister Narendra Modi now says was one of his objectives in banning 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, worth about $7.40 and $14.80.India is experiencing an acute shortage of bills to replace the large-denomination notes that were banned as of Nov. 9, and which made up 86 percent of the country\u2019s currency. There have been numerous reports of people waiting in line for hours at banks or A.T.M.s, only to find that the machines are out of cash.As the public struggles with too few bills in circulation, business has fallen in many sectors to a small fraction of what it was before the ban. Economists warn that India\u2019s growth of 7.3 percent in the most recent quarter, among the fastest of any large economy, could take a hit if the cash shortage continues.\u201cAfter the currency ban, my sales came down sharply,\u201d said Mr. Mandal, who sells dumplings from a handcart in a market in the New Ashok Nagar neighborhood. \u201cProviding change was a big problem.\u201dAfter a customer suggested that he take electronic payments, he downloaded software that allows him to accept such transactions on his phone. Forty percent of his sales are now conducted electronically, he says.Even merchants who do not have smartphones are contemplating buying one. \u201cIf people are flying in planes, how long we can ride on bullock cart?\u201d asked Sunil Jaiswal, who charges less than $2 to repair watches in an alley near Connaught Place.To be effective, the move had to be a closely guarded secret until the last minute, to prevent those holding black money from unloading it before the ban went into effect \u2014 the morning after the decision was announced. As a result, the government did not print enough replacement cash in time for the change, and it continues to struggle to do so fast enough, creating a cash shortage that has strangled large sectors of the economy.But Indians are switching to electronic payments more rapidly than many experts had predicted, and in speaking of the recent currency moves, Mr. Modi has begun emphasizing the benefits of a cashless economy over the anticorruption fight.Across the country, about 70,000 merchants a day are signing up for India\u2019s best-selling mobile payments platform, Paytm, about 14 times as many as the daily average before the currency decision, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm and One97 Communications, the start-up behind it.Since the large-currency ban, the number of daily transactions on Paytm has grown to nearly six million, an increase of 350 percent, and the service is adding half a million users each day, Mr. Sharma said.\u201cEarlier, we were the innovator, now we are the mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the start of the golden age for financial technology companies.\u201dMore than 230 million people in India use electronic wallets, the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said, representing nearly one-fifth of the country\u2019s population.At the same time, the government has tasked banks in the country with adding one million machines in stores to process credit and debit card transactions by March 2017, a two-thirds increase from the 1.5 million available today.The number of credit and debit card machines that have been added since the large-currency ban was put in place is not yet available. But Icici Bank, one of India\u2019s biggest private lenders, says it has detected a sharp increase in demand from merchants processing debit and credit card charges. A spokeswoman for Icici said that the bank had installed six times as many machines last week as it did, on average, before the limit on high-denomination bills.Still, A. P. Hota, managing director and chief executive of the National Payments Corporation of India, an umbrella group for sellers of retail payment systems, said that he was skeptical the government could achieve its goal of adding one million new credit and debit card machines in a few months, calling it \u201ca gigantic task.\u201d The infrastructure is not yet in place to process the paperwork involved and to teach merchants how to use the machines, he said.\u201cA merchant will have several legitimate queries, like how to reconcile the payments, how to get money, if there is a problem, whom to contact,\u201d Mr. Hota said. \u201cThere has to be an infrastructure to handle these queries.\u201dIn part because of increased demand from small and midsize merchants, as well as from government departments, the number of credit and debit card transactions has soared to 10 million a day, more than three times as many as before November, said Deepak Chandnani, managing director for South Asia and the Middle East of Worldline India Private Limited, a division of the French company Atos. Worldline produces about a third of the machines used to process these charges in India.One97, the owner of Paytm, has hired 3,500 employees in the last month, 50 percent more than it had hired in the previous two years, the company\u2019s founder, Mr. Sharma, said. Unable to meet demand from merchants seeking help setting up the systems, the company ran newspaper advertisements with instructions to help business owners do it themselves. The ads also serve as posters for merchants to advertise that they use Paytm.Saurabh Porwal, 31, who sells onions on the roadside in Harola Market in Noida, a city near Delhi, downloaded the Paytm app after seeing the newspaper advertisement, which he then posted on his stall. \u201cIf you deal in less cash, it is less of a problem,\u201d he says.Moving toward a cashless economy would carry benefits for the government, ensuring that more taxes are paid and providing banks with more reserves to extend loans. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent in the United States, a joint study by Google India and Boston Consulting Group found.Still, those adopting cashless technology are a minority. At Janpath Cloth Market in Delhi, where vendors shout out discounted prices to passers-by, only one of more than 100 open-air shops advertised a cashless system.Amit Maheshwari, who sells men\u2019s pants, displays a white piece of paper on his stall saying, in bold type, \u201cPaytm Accepted Here.\u201dAfter the currency change, sales at the shop fell to about 10 percent of what they were before, he said. Then a customer who was browsing said he would buy some pants if he could use Paytm. \u201cWe had no idea what this was,\u201d Mr. Maheshwari said. \u201cHe taught us how to use it.\u201dSince adopting Paytm, sales have risen to 50 percent of what they were before the currency change, he said. \u201cEverybody should use it. Anybody can use it,\u201d he said.But many vendors around India are still resistant. Mustkeem Ahemad, 38, who sells chicken in Harola Market, says that electronic payment systems are too complex for him.\u201cHow can you pay on a phone? Only an educated person can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am illiterate, so I just can\u2019t do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Google\u2019s Renewable Cloud", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byBitsThe next cat video you play on YouTube may help the green energy industry.To be clear, Google, which owns YouTube, will not be only consuming renewables: Its massive data centers are on big electric grids, which take power from a number of sources, including coal. Google arranges to have renewable sources on those grids, so that its net consumption isn\u2019t drawing down additional carbon-based power.In fact, in many cases it is buying more wind and solar power than it uses, because Google is still having a hard time developing those sources in Asia. As a result, it overprovisions in places like North America and Europe, where there are more wind turbines.This is a big deal for a couple of reasons. For one, most of the growth in industrial power consumption is from data centers, and Google, along with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, is building global cloud computing centers at an unprecedented clip.Some of the companies have been hit by environmentalists for not being green, and now all three companies are trying to be better corporate citizens, in terms of their consumption.Google also makes much of its efficient power usage inside its data centers. For this story, I went to Oklahoma, where a 50,000-acre wind farm generates power for the same grid where Google operates its second-largest computer complex in North America, a plot of eight large buildings not far from the Arkansas border.Inside the facility, Google has a lot of clever ways to reuse water, and bring outside air to cool its computer servers. In terms of power usage effectiveness, Google\u2019s computing plant uses almost all the power it takes in to run its machines \u2014 not long ago, computer centers used just half the power they brought in.Individual machines typically waste 30 percent of the power they take; Google\u2019s computers waste 10 percent to 15 percent.Google may be trying to give the planet one big green hug here, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t also looking out for the main chance. The green announcement is good public relations, and may spur other big companies to use more wind and solar. The industry is young enough that it\u2019s still finding economies of scale, so more consumers could lower Google\u2019s future acquisition costs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk.The F.B.I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the government\u2019s best-protected networks.Yared Tamene, the tech-support contractor at the D.N.C. who fielded the call, was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for \u201cthe Dukes\u201d and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks \u2014 in part because he wasn\u2019t certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.\u201cI had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo, obtained by The New York Times, that detailed his contact with the F.B.I.It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and information-warfare campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.Like another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee\u2019s old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.An examination by The Times of the Russian operation \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack, intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response \u2014 reveals a series of missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack.The D.N.C.\u2019s fumbling encounter with the F.B.I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House\u2019s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.The low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, whose private email account was hacked months later.By last summer, Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day \u2014 procured by Russian intelligence agents, posted on WikiLeaks and other websites, then eagerly reported on by the American media, including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail.In recent days, a skeptical president-elect, the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election.Many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election, while conceding that other factors \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses as a candidate; her private email server; the public statements of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about her handling of classified information \u2014 were also important.While there\u2019s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A low-cost, high-impact weapon that Russia had test-fired in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States, with devastating effectiveness. For Russia, with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of all-out war, cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap, hard to see coming, hard to trace.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d\u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201dThe United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201dMr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn.\u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed.\u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201dSitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture.Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again.There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have.\u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said.The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show.\u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201dPart of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201dMr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised.Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.\u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d\u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201dThe F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201dBy March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn.A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button.With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C.The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated.One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead.Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world.But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it.The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia.But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.\u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dSo the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld.Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call.With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers.\u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d\u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201dMr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them.\u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201dThe work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer.It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.\u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email.Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak.All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201dThe D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.\u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201dIt was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201dBut online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.\u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201dThat gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201dThat was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201dThe Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d\u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201dBut asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201dThough Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web.\u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201dInside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea.In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim.But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president.\u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.\u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201dEven something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky.\u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201dInstead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.\u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201dBut Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters.But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role.But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201dLater, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.\u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded.Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201dA covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201dThe Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive.Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump?In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals.One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper.

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Responsible When Extremists Get a Platform?", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIf these discussions were about litigating the past, their operating definition of what a platform is and does seemed to be stuck in the past as well. In computing, the word carries a different meaning. A platform is a system that enables other systems: A machine provides a platform for software; the software provides a platform for other software; that software might provide a platform for yet more software; and so on. The iPhone platform lets outside parties build and market apps like Uber; the Uber platform lets outside parties sign up to drive other Uber users for money.Somewhere between media and social media \u2014 between familiar ideas about politics and the news and the ones that underpin the world we live in today \u2014 platforms changed from responsibilities into abdications of responsibility. Claiming to provide a platform, in Silicon Valley, doesn\u2019t demand defense. It is the defense. Platforms don\u2019t cause problems; people do.The closest thing the new world of platforms has to a foundational text is a business book called \u201cInvisible Engines,\u201d published in 2006, which examined and tried to define a nascent form of business: one that doesn\u2019t just sell a good or service, but instead creates value by spawning entire ecosystems and economies. Nintendo and Sega, for example, allowed game developers to create and sell games that ran on their machines; smartphones let software companies connect with customers through app stores; eBay connects merchants and sellers, creating transactions but selling nothing itself. The book makes the prescient case that platforms will come to redefine our economy.\u201cThe platform\u2019s value is not necessarily what it does,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and one of the book\u2019s authors, \u201cbut what it enables.\u201d And what it enables can be enormous. It would be difficult to overstate the zeal that exists for platform companies in Silicon Valley. They represent staggering opportunities, the chance to create or remake entire industries and to preside over them indefinitely, with maximum control and minimum participation or liability. Airbnb has created a marketplace that overlaps substantially with the hotel business, but the properties it rents to users are owned by other users. (The company recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging a New York law that could result in fines against Airbnb for illegally listed properties; it agreed to drop the suit on the condition that fines be levied only against people listing property, not the company itself.) Uber created a sort of marketplace for transportation but doesn\u2019t own its vehicles nor \u2014 it claims, over and over, in courts all across the globe \u2014 does it employ its drivers.But the platform economies that are most developed and that have captured the most people \u2014 the ones that transact on attention, advertising and communication \u2014 are not immediately recognizable to their users as marketplaces. Facebook is not primarily understood among its billion and a half users as an attention brokerage, but that\u2019s exactly what it is: a middleman between users and other users; between advertisers and users; between developers and users; between publishers and advertisers and their viewers and readers.Participants successfully contribute to the broader marketplace by inducing other participants to engage more; beyond shares and followers, success is rewarded off-platform, with the conversion of attention into relationships, into advertising on websites, into sales or into influence and political power. Social platforms are the most extreme and advanced expression of what may be the defining corporate strategy of our time.And so it\u2019s valuable to listen to how they talk about themselves. In a comment under his post about the election, Zuckerberg reiterated, with force, what he sees as the nature of Facebook. \u201cI find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\u201d he wrote, explaining that the company also works on aerospace technology and business software. It\u2019s a platform that aspires to \u201cconnect the world\u201d but that must not be credited with changing it in the process.This line of thinking could not feel more distant from some of the alarming experiences social-media platforms foster. Reddit users terrorized by the openly bigoted and aggressive communities that have congregated there are not comforted by an appeal to economic principles. The virtues of an open platform are lost on the victim of a spontaneous Twitter mob, inspired anonymously or, as the case may be, by the president-elect of the United States. Understanding that the widespread belief in disinformation may have been an unforeseen externality of Facebook\u2019s design is more interesting than helpful, especially as Facebook says it will look to the wisdom of the crowd for solutions to its problems.In seeking and depending on minimum liability, platforms leave gaping voids. For an example of how such a void can be filled, and exploited, look no further than the Breitbart of the 2016 election. It is a site that frequently flaunts its success on social-media platforms and appears amenable to the prevailing winds of change. \u201cBreitbart Ranked #1 for Most Shared Facebook Content on Presidential Debate Day,\u201d read one headline. \u201cMedia Firms Lose Control of News as Tech Platforms Rise,\u201d read another from June. Another story from August begins, \u201cBreitbart News has jumped to the 11th biggest presence on Facebook in terms of total engagements for the month of July,\u201d a ranking of likes, shares and comments that placed the site between The Times and The Washington Post.The site is also keenly aware of its dependence on social media, so attempts made by these platforms to regulate participants or to ban or discourage hateful behavior are covered by Breitbart as conspiracies or assaults on freedom. The site wrote aggressively about frail allegations that Facebook had censored conservative content in its trending-topic module. (Facebook subsequently fired the team responsible for moderating it.) It describes attempts at Twitter moderation as censorship and has characterized the company\u2019s recent account bans as a \u201cpurge.\u201dMany media companies mistakenly imagine Facebook is some sort of partner \u2014 a larger entity that exists on the same spectrum. But Breitbart behaves as though it knows this isn\u2019t true. In practice, it has embraced its role as a platform citizen, one more subservient content peddler among many. In this sense, Breitbart couldn\u2019t have been the platform for the alt-right online. That title would belong to Reddit, to Twitter, to Facebook or to Google, if ever they wanted to claim it.Advertisement"}

We will continue to uphold San Francisco\u2019s sanctuary city for all immigrants.\u201dBut students and parents continued to express anxiety over the election of Donald J.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Currency Didn\u2019t Really Drop, Despite Jitters Over Trump", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported bySinosphereHONG KONG \u2014 Donald J. Trump has irritated China even before taking office as president, with criticism of the country\u2019s trade and currency practices and an unexpected phone call with the president of Taiwan.For a few hours on Tuesday, it looked to some as if China had struck back.Data services widely available to the public showed that the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, had been sharply devalued as China slept.Such a move would roil global markets and drastically escalate economic tensions between Beijing and the incoming administration. And because China tightly controls the value of its currency, such a sharp and sudden move would be no accident.But no deliberate devaluation took place. Instead, the culprit was a technical problem.Concerns are already high that slowing economic growth and persistent capital outflows are putting pressure on Beijing to let its currency weaken.The renminbi mainly trades onshore in China during normal business hours \u2014 and it does not trade overnight, when the supposedly big devaluation took place.A basic Google search \u2014 and data published by XE.com, one of the world\u2019s most popular currency websites \u2014 appeared to show early Tuesday that the renminbi had suddenly fallen more than 8 percent.Both Google Finance and XE appear to have used erroneous data. It was unclear what pricing sources were in play, but on Monday, ICAP, a foreign currency broker based in London, published errant quotes for renminbi-to-dollar exchange rates.Detailed price data carried by Bloomberg and Reuters showed ICAP on Tuesday morning as quoting the renminbi at higher than 7.4 per dollar. The actual market rate at the time was about 6.86 per dollar.A sudden drop in the Chinese currency\u2019s value seems to have been caused by a technical issue, not manipulation.\u201cNot a tradable price,\u201d said Stephen Innes, a senior currency trader at Oanda in Singapore, said of the conspicuously weak renminbi rate. \u201cIt looks like little more than an error.\u201d\u201cWe have a wide array of upstream data sources, several of which provided rates which our algorithms interpreted as a genuine movement\u201d in the renminbi, XE said in a statement. \u201cWe have confirmed with our upstream providers that these were inaccurate and have adjusted our rates accordingly.\u201dGoogle declined to comment, and ICAP did not respond to requests for comment.The related rates for offshore renminbi, which trades around the clock, were unfazed on Tuesday.Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to reiterate his criticism of Beijing\u2019s currency policy, saying: \u201cDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency?\u201dHours later, the seemingly sudden drop in the renminbi appeared to some like a direct retaliation.Mr. Balding cited the downward pressures that have been building on the Chinese currency in the face of outflows, as citizens and companies rush to get their renminbi offshore and convert it into more international currencies, like the dollar.\u201cTrump just exacerbates all these things, raising the nervousness of an already jittery situation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Duck into one of many stairwells that will eventually lead to the rim of the ancient Citadel complex, a rambling collection of remnants from the Roman, Byzantine and Umayyad periods, with a 360-degree view of the neighboring ranges. At the Temple of Hercules, two massive columns topped with an arch dramatically frame the setting sun. Head to the overlook around 6 p.m., when the mesmerizing calls to prayer cascade from dozens of minarets dotting the hilly panorama, building into a symphony. Juice stalls and sidewalk cafes are far more common than bars, but there are some Western-style watering holes. Two that you won\u2019t find easily are OTR, Jordan\u2019s first hipster speakeasy, and tiny Petro. Wedged between alleyways downtown, Petro is a dark, smoky dive with a back room about as wide as a delivery van and with pints of gold label Arak Haddad to go. Order two glasses (4 dinars), served with almonds and white cheese, perch at a back counter and watch the colorful characters come and go. OTR, for Off the Record, is an upper-crust hideaway with a dress code, a 1920s jazz motif and cocktails like the Street Swing (arak, pomegranate juice, triple sec and lemon juice; 8 dinars). A popular breakfast ballast in the Middle East is fuul, a mashed fava bean concoction served up fast, tasty and cheap at Hashem on King Faisal Street downtown. Find a table in the alleyway under the strung lights and big umbrellas, and ask a green-aproned waiter for the fuul and falafel. Soon bowls of fuul and luscious hummus in local olive oil will arrive, along with bite-size falafel balls and French fries. After settling up (5.50 dinars) at the front booth but before you head out, check out the photo of King Abdullah II and his family eating here. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Donald Trump\u2019s Corporate \u2018Tax Holiday\u2019 Create Jobs? Not Necessarily", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has said he would like to create a \u201ctax holiday\u201d so that American companies can bring back profit that was generated overseas at a lower rate. In his view, this influx of cash will create jobs.But corporate boards and executives may have different ideas.They are likely to use much of the estimated $2 trillion held overseas to acquire businesses in the United States, to buy back their own stock or to pay down debt, say advisers of America\u2019s top corporate executives.Merger bankers \u201care sharpening their pencils with what types of deals those larger companies can look at,\u201d said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of mergers and acquisitions in the Americas for the Swiss bank UBS. \u201cI think M.&A. will be fairly high on the list.\u201dAmerican corporations have kept an accumulation of earnings abroad because they would be subject to paying more taxes when they bring it home.If they were to bring that capital back, those companies could use it to invest in their businesses, which may in turn create jobs. Yet that is only one of several options.If the priority turns out to be deals, that would be good news for investment bankers who generate fees from large advisory assignments. It would be less so for American workers who might get laid off as a result of cost cuts derived from combining two companies.Some of those cuts were tied to mergers and acquisitions. As part of the study, Oracle explained how its repatriated funds were used for two acquisitions: Retek, a software provider to the retail industry, and PeopleSoft, a rival in enterprise software. After buying both for a combined $11 billion, Oracle \u201celiminated thousands of jobs,\u201d the study found.Today, bankers are rearranging their chess boards, trying to figure out which companies may want to make moves, and which ones might be ripe for the taking. That has kept the bankers in technology and health care busy. Some of the top companies on everyone\u2019s watch list include Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company), Amgen, Apple, Cisco, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.Yet at the moment, the potential for tax reform in 2017 has led some companies to delay deal making, according to Marc Zenner, the co-head of J.P. Morgan\u2019s corporate finance advisory team.\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got right now is a fair bit of uncertainty about what the state of the world will be next year with taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to do this deal right now, maybe you can wait until next year so you can finance optimally.\u201dStill, some boards appear to believe they may get a better price if they sign a desired deal sooner rather than later. If tax rates decrease, a company\u2019s profitability increases, making it a more expensive acquisition target. And, if all of the repatriating companies go after the same targets, that could drive up the price as well.\u201cWhat people fear is that if everyone waits for clarity on timing and specific tax treatment, the markets could be a lot higher, purely as it relates to this influx of capital,\u201d Peter A. Weinberg, founding partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, said. \u201cDo you commit capital today with the risk of timing, or do you wait for certainty and risk paying more than you would today?\u201dMr. Weinberg said that if there were a significant reduction of the tax rate, companies would bring at least $1 trillion back, an amount large enough to affect the prices of equities and debt.Some companies may not be interested in deal making. Apple, which has the largest overseas cash load, is historically not a big acquirer; its largest purchase was its $3 billion deal for Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014. Microsoft, with the second-largest cash hoard, will most likely still be digesting its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, announced in June.But these companies will not get away with simply letting the cash sit on their balance sheet unused for too long.\u201cIf the money is coming back, it would be hard to tell investors, \u2018I have access to it and you\u2019re not getting it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zenner said.A certain class of hedge funds, known as activist investors, have been known to screen for companies with large piles of cash relative to their market valuations. They take large stakes and then push management to use the money for stock buybacks or richer dividends.During the 2004 tax holiday, stock repurchases were a forbidden use of the cash, but that rule proved difficult to enforce. A 2009 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that each dollar of repatriated cash was linked to an increase of 60 to 92 cents in some form of payout to shareholders.There are far more activist investors with billions more in capital to deploy this time. While activists\u2019 assets under management declined slightly this year, they still amount to about $175 billion, 50 percent higher than just four years ago, according to data compiled by the research firm Activist Insight.It is unclear exactly how tax reform under Mr. Trump might look, but many on Wall Street are optimistic about what it means for their clients.\u201cThe potential for these reforms, around reduced corporate tax rates and cash repatriation, to put more discretionary cash flow in the hands of companies is significant,\u201d said Avinash Mehrotra, co-head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s M.&A. shareholder advisory group. \u201cBoards and management teams will have some interesting choices around acquisitions, longer-term capital investments, debt reduction and return of capital.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Year\u2019s Top Stories From the Fashion World", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byThe Year in Style 2016Fashion may never quite recover from 2016. The most memorable thread of the last 12 months had less to do with clothes than existential self-doubt. When Jeremy Scott literally put a smoking \u2014 O.K., not a gun, but a dress \u2014 on his Moschino runway, it proved to be the metaphor for the whole darn year. In the end, much of what we thought we knew was in question, and all we actually knew was to expect the unexpected. It came in many different shapes, and styles.2. Designer turnover went into hyperdrive.Headhunters must have had a banner year in 2016. If once upon a time the top job at a big brand was the ultimate prize for many designers \u2014 and once you got it, you didn\u2019t let go till they pried the sketch pad from your withered hands \u2014 now the average term seems to be three years or less.Is this the new normal? Creative whiplash awaits.3. But great designers still couldn\u2019t get a job.At this date, the top spots at Cavalli and DKNY remain unfilled, though there are a shocking number of formerly feted designers currently \u201cexploring their options\u201d after leaving a big brand post. Among the ranks of fashion\u2019s unemployed are Alber Elbaz (formerly of Lanvin); Mr. Slimane (though the fact that he sued the YSL parent company Kering, demanding it reinstate his noncompete clause, may have made him a less attractive prospect); Marco Zanini (late of Schiaparelli and Rochas); Stefano Pilati (Yves Saint Laurent and Zegna); Mr. Copping; and Mr. Dundas.Someone, hire these guys. Or even better, back them in creating their own brand.4. The fashion outsider became the ultimate insider.5. The hot new name in fashion was \u2026 Canada?6. The 1980s returned. So did oversize everything.7. Rihanna took Paris (Fashion Week).Turns out we all want to be queen of the stationary bike. But she wears the crown.8. The end of plus sizes.Careful who you call \u201cplus size.\u201d The model Ashley Graham, erstwhile poster girl for the larger sector, entered the mainstream on the covers of Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue and British Vogue, where, according to the Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, some designers refused to dress her, as it would have entailed making clothes tailored to her proportions. Ms. Shulman used her Editor\u2019s Letter to call them out (though she didn\u2019t name-and-shame).9. Department stores struggled while specialty boutiques began to expand.When Macy\u2019s announced it was closing 40 stores at the beginning of the year, many \u201cThe End of the Department Store\u201d articles ensued, which were reinforced when Neiman Marcus announced job cuts later in the year after falling profits and rumors of its sale (they have since died down). Reports of retail\u2019s death are probably exaggerated, but what is certain is that their pain may be the specialty store\u2019s gain.Ikram, in Chicago, threw itself a star-studded 15th birthday party (Mayor Rahm Emanuel showed up, as did George Lucas). In Dallas, Forty Five Ten opened a 37,000-square-foot emporium, and Milan\u2019s destination store, 10 Corso Como, plans to open an outpost in New York. What do these stores have in common? They reflect an individual point of view. They don\u2019t try to please all of the people all of the time. Perversely, it\u2019s the new recipe for success.10. Melania Trump became a lightning rod.First up was Sophie Theallet, who posted a public letter explaining her position; she was cheered on by Humberto Leon, of Opening Ceremony. Then Marc Jacobs said he, too, might refrain, as did Tom Ford. Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera took the opposite tack. Fashion, like the nation, is divided; we\u2019ll see how things turn out come the new year and the new administration. But even this sure thing is not so sure any more.1. Bomber jackets became the fashion hula hoop.Can you call a development underway for years the biggest style trend of 2016? You probably can if it is a bomber jacket. Building on the success of the \u201csouvenir\u201d jackets that designers \u2014 Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Kim Jones at Louis Vuitton \u2014 put forth in recent seasons, the bomber was not only a ubiquitous men\u2019s wear default in 2016, but also one of those magical Google trends.No less practical for the earthbound, the bomber turned out to be the biggest selling silhouette last year for designers like Todd Snyder, one of the earliest adopters of the trend.\u201cMen\u2019s wear is always about that third piece,\u201d Mr. Snyder, an American, said. \u201cYou have the jacket and the trousers, and the bomber is the third piece you can layer on and wear with anything.\u201d2. Diversity on men\u2019s wear runways and in editorial castings put the women\u2019s wear sector to shame.If men\u2019s wear has traditionally been a backwater of fashion, following more than leading trends in thought and design, there is one way in which that is clearly no longer the case: diversity. Despite decades of cultural breast-beating, panel discussions and industry initiatives, tokenism in women\u2019s fashion remains. It is the uncommon women\u2019s wear runway whose racial composition bears much resemblance to that on the streets outside the shows.Yet, quietly and steadily (and motivated, it must be said, in large part by the buying power of previously neglected groups), men\u2019s wear has opened up to a wider view of what constitutes the consumer base and, for that matter, humanity.3. Gosha Rubchinskiy used social media to hack the fashion system.There is much to marvel about in Gosha Rubchinskiy, the Russian designer and photographer (and former hairdresser) whose cultlike ascendance can be attributed to his blocky Constructivist graphics, to the shrewdness of his styling inspired by Moscow skate rats and street boys, and to the substantial support and marketing savvy of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, which distributes his brand.Yet Mr. Rubchinskiy\u2019s slickest accomplishment may be how stealthily he exploits social media to win over an army of boys to his fashion cause. Consider the casting for his June show at the Pitti Uomo men\u2019s wear trade fair in Florence, Italy. So overwhelming was early response to an Instagram call for model applicants that it crashed an assistant\u2019s email account.It says a lot about the vaunted democratization of fashion that, by the time Mr. Rubchinskiy staged a show of clothes suitable for a Soviet-era starveling and held it in a defunct Fascist-era cigarette factory, he had recruited underage kids from all points of the globe: rabbit-pale teenagers right out of a Dennis Cooper novel and hailing from, among other places, Copenhagen; Moscow; Yorkshire, England; and Santa Ana, Calif.4. Arnold Palmer\u2019s death proved that old school did it best.Though one may think there is little left to add to the universal encomiums that came after the death in September of the telegenic sportsman known as the King of Golf, the obituaries tended to omit an important point. With his taut, muscular frame, his narrow waist, sturdy forearms and easy athletic grace, Palmer, who died at 87, was in certain ways as notable for nonchalant assurance of his personal style as for his game.\u201cObviously, he had the blessing of an insanely athletic body,\u201d John Jannuzzi, the United States deputy lead for Twitter Moments (who, as a digital editor at GQ once advised readers on six style moves to steal from Palmer), said of the golfer. \u201cBut his clothes were in constant harmony, perfectly well fit and classic, polished, nothing ever too loud or crazy.\u201dOf equal importance is that, in the innocent days of Palmer\u2019s early successes, athletes hadn\u2019t yet become corporate sandwich boards. Palmer was instrumental in changing that, but never mind. \u201cHe was not second-guessing what he was wearing,\u201d Mr. Jannuzzi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what a lot of guys are still after, knowing what works for them and owning their own style.\u201d5. Demna Gvsalia manned up.It remains to be seen whether any but the most fashion obsessed (or John Waters \u2014 possibly the same thing) would be caught dead in one of the suits Demna Gvsalia offered in his Balenciaga debut, a first-ever men\u2019s wear show for that storied house. With proportions alternating between Frankenstein (or David Byrne in Talking Heads) shapes and frock coats tight as tourniquets, the clothes risked being outright ludicrous.Unquestionably they flouted comfort or ease. Yet, in rethinking the suit\u2019s silhouette, Mr. Gvsalia was also experimenting with the architecture of gender at a time when it is increasingly seen as something the psychoanalytic theorist Adrienne Harris terms a \u201csoft assembly.\u201d There was nothing soft about Mr. Gvsalia\u2019s constructions. At Balenciaga, he took masculinity and gave it some spine.6. Rick Owens had a vision.Hasn\u2019t the time come for a full-scale Rick Owens museum retrospective? Aren\u2019t we overdue for a curatorial assessment of the clothes, furniture, store design, architecture, photographic imagery and soft-sculptural men\u2019s wear conjured by this driven, intuitive, musclebound and aesthetically off-kilter Californian? Imagine a series of museum galleries inspired by the Brutalist hulk in Paris that Mr. Owens calls home (and where his wife, Michele Lamy, keeps bees on the rooftop), filled with the slumping, folded and armoring garments Mr. Owens showed in a dystopian show titled \u201cMastodon.\u201dAdd his $200,000 ton-weight marble bed, stag stools and alchemy chairs. Throw in the wax likenesses Mr. Owens commissioned from the experts at Madame Tussauds in 2006 for Pitti Uomo and that depicted the designer naked and urinating on the floor. Put up some text panels with Owens maxims like this one, from a 2011 Rizzoli monograph: \u201cI would lay a black glittering turd on the white landscape of conformity.\u201d In truth he already has.7. Patches stuck around.For a moment, the trend for patches \u2014 like so many other elements of modern dress, they originated in military uniforms \u2014 seemed to have peaked in 2016 and was headed for the style boneyard, there to rest alongside flat-forms and microbags. But then Donatella Versace came along with a fine fall men\u2019s wear collection that included, among the ice-blue winter woolens and space-themed suits, a jumpsuit that looked to have patch acne. Right then you knew embroidered madness was here to stay.8. Bill Cunningham\u2019s corner became a frozen zone.On June 25, Mr. Cunningham, the beloved street photographer, died. Very soon thereafter, New York City announced it would rename one of his favorite perches Bill Cunningham Corner. It was there on a curb at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street near the Louis Vuitton flagship that he installed himself regularly for decades and \u201cturned our sidewalks into runways and New Yorkers into models,\u201d as Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement in July.Just over four months later, Mr. Trump was elected president, and the stretch of Fifth Avenue near his Trump Tower residence became a heavily guarded and barricaded security zone. All four points of the intersection bristle with fencing and Jersey barriers. Secret Service details and New York City police officers keep pedestrians moving along. It is one of countless postelection ironies that, were Mr. Cunningham still with us, he would not be welcome on Bill Cunningham Corner anymore.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Long, Lonely Fall of a Heisman Trophy Winner", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Rashaan Salaam, the 1994 trophy winner, was found dead this month. Now, many wonder if brain damage and the pressure of living up to Heisman hopes contributed to his end.Supported byBOULDER, Colo. \u2014 Through the darkness, Rashaan Salaam drove his run-down Suzuki sedan. He was, as usual, alone.For months, friends said, Salaam had been a recluse who left his rented condo in a Denver suburb only occasionally, to buy groceries and, even more rarely, for a solitary morning walk. Now and then he went to a bar for drinks and a steak, sitting by himself.But on this Monday night, Dec. 5, Salaam, a former football standout, was headed for the site of his greatest triumph.Now, on an unseasonably warm December night, he drove past the stadium and cut through the heart of the idyllic Colorado campus, where, he often said, he still felt most comfortable.Less than two miles from where he had scored his career-defining touchdown, he pulled into the tiny parking area of Eben G. Fine Park, bordering the burbling Boulder Creek.Around 8 p.m., a few hours after the voting closed for the 2016 Heisman and five days before the 22nd anniversary of Salaam\u2019s trophy win, a young man walking in the park saw a body lying beside an idling sedan. Salaam. A revolver lay nearby.Salaam\u2019s death at the age of 42 is being investigated as a likely suicide. Autopsy results are expected in about a month.But in the days since the death, as friends, relatives and associates puzzle over the circumstances, they cannot help but wonder if the Heisman and its attendant expectations of fame had undercut his life instead of elevating it.\u201cRashaan came back to Boulder a few years ago to revive himself,\u201d said Francisco Lujan, one of Salaam\u2019s close friends and a business associate. \u201cHe was trying to find a way to find himself. He returned to where the memories were good.\u201dT .J. Cunningham, a Colorado teammate who had stayed in touch with Salaam until a few months ago, said he believed Salaam\u2019s football career, which sputtered after he left college largely because of injuries, always weighed on him.\u201cRashaan was 20 years old when he won the Heisman Trophy,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cTo achieve the epitome of success at 20, but then you can\u2019t get to that point again \u2014 what did that do to Rashaan?\u201dThat may be an insoluble question. For people who knew him, the prospect that he took his own life is hard to reconcile with someone best known for an infectious smile that brightened a room when he entered it.As Cunningham said: \u201cHe was a happy guy. I can still see him at Christmas last year, at my house teaching my 2-year-old how to hit a baseball. But, you know, Rashaan struggled with some things.\u201dMany of his friends believed he suffered from depression and mood swings, typical signs of the brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., that has afflicted scores of players.The disease is linked to repeated hits to the head and diagnosed posthumously, but it is unclear if Salaam\u2019s family members have donated his brain to be tested. The Salaam family declined to be interviewed for this article, and multiple phone messages and email messages left for relatives drew no response.Salaam\u2019s brother, Jabali Alaji, told USA Today shortly after Rashaan\u2019s funeral on Dec. 9 that if Salaam\u2019s brain were examined: \u201cI would guarantee they\u2019d find it. I would guarantee it.\u201dBut several of Salaam\u2019s friends who spoke with family members said they were told Salaam\u2019s brain would not be tested.Though injured often, Salaam had no known history of repeated concussions or head trauma. But as Cunningham said: \u201cRashaan had a lot of collisions. He wasn\u2019t a fake and juke guy; he ran right through you.\u201cC.T.E.? He showed all the symptoms,\u201d Cunningham said, \u201cand C.T.E. probably added to that.\u201dWhatever the cause, it was obvious to people around him that Salaam was dealing with mental health problems.He routinely retreated to his condo and stayed there. Phone calls and texts from friends went unreturned for days or weeks, especially since October.Salaam spent Thanksgiving by himself, a next-door neighbor said, in his small, plain one-bedroom condo next to a playground and a municipal wastewater plant in Superior, Colo.\u201cHe was always in his condo,\u201d said the neighbor, Deanna Ardrey. \u201cHe would sit there by himself every day. You knew there was something off.\u201dRiley Robert Hawkins, a school social worker and behavioral therapist who had been a partner with Salaam in a charitable foundation since 2011, talked to him about whether he should seek treatment for depression.\u201cYou could tell he was fighting some things,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cAnxiety and depression, that\u2019s bipolar. It was always there to some degree.\u201cLike many of us,\u201d he said, \u201cI think he thought he had a handle on things.\u201dMaurice Henriques, another Colorado teammate who had remained close with Salaam, said it was impossible to pinpoint what ailed him.\u201cFor the family\u2019s sake, you\u2019d love for there to be an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably a cocktail of things \u2014 depression, some C.T.E., and Rashaan still trying to deal with the transition from football.\u201cHow,\u201d he added, \u201cdo you re-identify yourself?\u201dWhen he was first handed the Heisman in 1994, Salaam had no idea how much the 25-pound trophy would complicate the rest of his life. Going forward, it distorted the perception of his career.Salaam had a spectacular N.F.L. rookie season with the Chicago Bears but faded markedly thereafter, lasting for only four seasons.After that, he more and more kept his distance from the trophy, whose renowned pose is a stiff arm.\u201cHe felt people viewed him as a failure,\u201d said David Plati, an associate athletic director at Colorado and a friend of Salaam\u2019s for nearly a quarter-century. \u201cHe was frustrated with his N.F.L. career. That\u2019s the burden the Heisman carries. He felt pressure that he had to go do something in the pros as good or greater than what he did in college.\u201cHe felt that people were looking at him, thinking that he let them down.\u201dStill, the Heisman loomed large. Everybody wanted to see it and touch it. Salaam wanted to stand apart from it.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the trophy itself,\u201d Lujan said. \u201cWhen he was making an appearance, people would always ask if he could bring the Heisman Trophy to the engagement. He\u2019d turn them down. He didn\u2019t like carrying the trophy around. It made him feel like the only reason anyone wanted to see him was because he had a Heisman Trophy.\u201dOnce, visiting Salaam at his home, a friend saw the trophy being used as a doorstop. For the majority of the last 22 years, Salaam\u2019s mother kept the trophy at the family home in San Diego.Salaam was conflicted about the trophy from the start; he declined to do several major interviews the year he won it.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Deep down Rashaan didn\u2019t care about the trophy and never did because he didn\u2019t like being singled out,\u201d Plati said.\u201cRashaan wanted to be just one of the guys,\u201d Plati said. \u201cBut he knew his offensive linemen wanted him to win the Heisman. He understood it was important for the university and the football program.\u201dSalaam is Colorado\u2019s only Heisman winner and eventually got into the experience of winning it, even enjoying the week in New York for the ceremony. At the time, it seemed like a one-week, one-time thing \u2014 not a lifetime designation permanently attached to his name.He had won the trophy in his junior year and entered the 1995 N.F.L. draft. Yet he was perturbed, even insulted, when he was the fifth running back taken in the first round.But Salaam had proved others wrong in his career before.With his mother urging him on, he had left his hometown, San Diego, and traveled by bus two hours daily to attend La Jolla Country Day, a private school where he excelled academically and on the football team. But La Jolla played eight-man football, and Salaam was barely noticed by college recruiters. His La Jolla coach mounted a campaign to promote him, and soon Colorado took him on.He was, however, on the third string as a college freshman. Though he was a sturdy 6-foot-1 and weighed in at 220 pounds, there were doubts about whether he had the speed to compete at the highest level of college ball. He made progress as a sophomore, and by his spectacular junior season at Colorado had more than vanquished his critics. And yet, N.F.L. evaluators still had reservations, which is how Salaam fell to the draft\u2019s 21st pick.As a rookie, Salaam rushed for 1,074 yards and 10 touchdowns, becoming the youngest N.F.L. player to rush for more than 1,000 yards. But a series of leg injuries limited his playing time and effectiveness in the next two seasons, his last with the Bears.In 1999, he carried the football once for 2 yards for the hapless 2-14 Cleveland Browns. He was also briefly with two other N.F.L. teams but never got on the field. In 2001, Salaam played for the Memphis Maniax of the ill-fated X.F.L.At 28, he regrouped and spent nearly a year getting in top shape because the San Francisco 49ers had invited him to training camp. Around that time in 2003, in an interview with ESPN, Salaam decided to open up about his marijuana use while with the Bears.He said he was too young to handle the money and success of his early N.F.L. career and blamed an undisciplined lifestyle for hampering his development as a professional. Salaam later said he had hoped the interview would show a newfound maturity, since he was admitting to a mistake and describing a new, robust work ethic.But the reaction to the interview, and to Salaam, was decidedly negative. He was cut by the 49ers toward the end of training camp. After a short-lived flirtation with the Canadian Football League, his football career was over.Salaam said in interviews years ago that he had invested much of his nearly $4 million N.F.L. payday with a San Diego brokerage firm. Shortly after retiring from football, Salaam began spending months in China, where he started a mixed martial arts business. None of his friends were sure how or why he made a connection with China, but there he promoted championship events and shuttled between his native California and Beijing.By the beginning of this decade, he sold the China-based venture and returned to San Diego. There, Salaam lived quietly, and mostly, anonymously. A self-described \u201cbachelor for life,\u201d Salaam never married, although his friends said they had met his various girlfriends over the years.About five years ago, Salaam decided to return to the Boulder area in what was viewed as an attempt to regain his footing in a familiar place.He began working with Lujan, a coach at a local high school, who had a start-up company that did testing for N.F.L. and C.F.L. scouting combines.Salaam was paid $2,500 or more for public appearances and helped with the testing. He appeared financially secure. While he did not live extravagantly \u2014 rent at his condo this year was about $1,500 a month \u2014 he never seemed in need of funds. A 2011 newspaper account reported that Salaam sold ornate rings he had received for winning the Heisman Trophy for roughly $9,000. Salaam said that the rings were sold, without his knowledge, by a family member.\u201cRashaan\u2019s primary goal when he came here was to start a foundation to help at-risk youth,\u201d said Lujan, who eventually put Salaam in touch with Hawkins, the school social worker, who years earlier had founded the SPIN Foundation \u2014 Supporting People in Need.Together, Hawkins and Salaam planned events, camps, clinics and appearances, and they devised programs to benefit underprivileged children. Salaam became a fixture at Jefferson High School in Edgewater, Colo., where Hawkins has worked for 15 years. Salaam regularly spoke with classes and worked with students individually and in groups.\u201cRashaan was like a family member to Jefferson students,\u201d said Oscar Lopez, a senior at the high school who participated in the trip. \u201cHe was like a big brother and he was always encouraging us to better ourselves. He talked about the mistakes he made and how he kept going. His big message was to stay positive.\u201dLopez, who is a wrestler and football player, said Salaam once cautioned him about taking care of his body in athletics.\u201cHe told me if I was hurt, to protect myself and stay off the field,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cHe had injuries and went back out there. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that, let it heal.\u2019\u201dLujan said the cost of the Aspen trip was $25,000.At Jefferson High, students who had laughed on the Aspen slopes with Salaam and been buoyed by his enthusiasm for their future prospects were thunderstruck by his death.\u201cI broke down because he was always here for us,\u201d said Janessa Kiome, a senior at Jefferson. \u201cAnd that night, no one was there for him.\u201dHawkins and others have been counseling the Jefferson students. Seated in his school office last week, Hawkins sighed and said: \u201cRashaan was trying to save lives, but he had trouble saving his own life. There are things we can explain and things that we can\u2019t explain.\u201dIt had been hard to get to know Salaam well, as he was introverted by nature and something of a loner, especially in the last few months.He was a semiregular at C.B. & Potts, a bar and restaurant about a mile from his condo in Superior. He usually came in around 10 on Sunday nights, well past the dinner rush. He was always alone, and he would sit in a section of the bar unoccupied by other patrons, ordering a steak and two or three vodka drinks known as Moscow Mules.\u201cHe was always nice to everyone,\u201d said Chris Rosa, a bartender there who works Sunday nights. \u201cBut more than a few times, we\u2019d be talking and he\u2019d say he was mad that injuries and bad luck messed up his N.F.L. career. He said things spiraled out of control and he wished things had been different.\u201dRosa said he had not seen him in the last couple of months.Neither had his friends or the people he worked with, like Lujan and Hawkins.\u201cEveryone has the same story,\u201d Lujan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked each other, \u2018When did you last hear from him?\u2019 And everyone answers, \u2018About a month or six weeks ago.\u2019\u201dSalaam\u2019s neighbor Deanna Ardrey was among the few who saw him regularly during this period.She had met Salaam a few months earlier when she moved in with her boyfriend. She learned only by accident that Salaam had played football, then Googled him and was dumbfounded to discover his celebrity.\u201cWe talked about football, but he was more likely to talk about other things, like astronomy,\u201d Ardrey said. \u201cHe was always pointing out planets to us in the sky.\u201dOn sunny days, Salaam kept his front door open and Ardrey would hear music playing. In the fall and winter, Salaam\u2019s television would be tuned to football games.\u201cWe would hear him watching games all night and yelling at the TV,\u201d Ardrey said. \u201cBut I mean, he was always there by himself. Every day, every night. His car was always in the driveway.\u201dIn the days before his death, Ardrey noticed something unusual: His car was frequently gone at night.\u201cIn the last few days, I\u2019ve been thinking: How many times did he go to that park thinking he might \u2014 and then changed his mind?\u201d Ardrey wondered last week.On the morning of Dec. 5, Ardrey saw her neighbor as she got in her car and waved at him. He waved back and smiled. Much later, he drove away from the condo, leaving a light on in the living room.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Refugee\u2019s Arrest Turns a Crime Into National News (and Debate) in Germany", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 When a 19-year-old medical student was found raped and drowned in the university city of Freiburg in October, it was seen as a sad and awful crime, but a local one. Beyond a few tabloids, the story failed to make national headlines.But only after Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of her cabinet weighed in on the fierce debate over that question did the country\u2019s leading public broadcaster, ARD, pick up the story, which it had originally judged did not meet the threshold for national news.Over the past week, citizens, politicians and journalists have wrestled with the reality that to the German public, it seems that a crime committed by a migrant is of national interest and importance, while a similar one committed by a German is, perhaps, not.ARD\u2019s earlier decision not to report on the crime set off further anger and accusations that the country\u2019s \u201cliberal media elite\u201d were intent on protecting migrants, going so far as to underreport or even cover up their crimes.The differing views have revealed deep rifts in German society between those who support Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision to welcome some one million migrants and those who view the newcomers, who are mostly Muslim, as a threat to the country\u2019s stability and security.Typing the German words \u201care migrants\u201d into Google\u2019s search engine in Germany completes the phrase with \u201cmore criminal than Germans\u201d on its second suggestion. In an attempt to calm a heated debate and answer just that question, Germany\u2019s Federal Criminal Office, or BKA, released statistics in June about migrant criminality last year.Less than 10 percent of Germany\u2019s population of 81 million people is foreign born. Of the roughly two million people investigated for all crimes, just 6 percent were migrants.Of 2,721 crimes that ended in a death, migrants were responsible for 233, or about 9 percent. And of 1,683 cases of sexual abuse, including rape, migrants were responsible for about 5 percent.All of those percentages were at least double the previous year\u2019s, but the BKA report noted that the migrant population had increased by 357 percent.In short, it was not a particularly damning portrait.After members of Ms. Merkel\u2019s cabinet and other leading politicians from across the spectrum joined the debate, Kai Gniffke, ARD\u2019s editor in chief, defended the station\u2019s decision in a blog post.After careful consideration, he said, editors did not consider the crime in Freiburg to be any different from the roughly 300 other murders that take place in Germany each year. But as the crime, and the station\u2019s handling of it, became the center of a stormy national debate, ARD changed its mind, even inviting Ms. Merkel on the evening news program to comment.\u201cIf it should emerge that it was an Afghan refugee, then that must be condemned, as would be with every other murder,\u201d the chancellor told ARD. But she warned against condemning or targeting all refugees, stressing that \u201cthe case remains a tragic event that must be cleared up, and must be openly discussed.\u201dHer conservative Christian Democrats have begun taking a harder line, passing a resolution at their party congress this week aimed at toughening penalties for forced marriage and honor killings and urging an end to dual citizenship.The far right has been quick to seize on crimes like the murder in Freiburg of Maria Ladenburger, whose body was spotted in the Dreisam River by a jogger on Oct. 17, the morning after she was killed.The police say they identified the suspect \u2014 a 17-year-old whose name they gave only as Hussein K., in keeping with German privacy law \u2014 through DNA evidence from a strand of hair found near the crime scene.In the aftermath, Hans Peter Stauch, a member of the legislature in the state, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, for the rightist-populist Alternative for Germany party, warned of future dangers.\u201cThe refugees that have come to us are certainly not per se to be marked as bad or criminal,\u201d he wrote in a letter to a local newspaper, The Reutlinger Wochenblatt. \u201cBut it would be and is na\u00efve, if not outright careless, to declare that through such uncontrolled immigration \u2018only\u2019 the peaceful and good people have come here.\u201cIt is equally na\u00efve and careless to believe that especially the young men, who have been socialized in an archaic value system from the Middle Ages, will be magically transformed into enlightened, socially acceptable democrats after they cross our borders,\u201d he added.Such feelings have made editorial decisions especially wrenching for the country\u2019s two main broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, which are funded by a public that increasingly wants a say in how its money is spent.\u201cThe public broadcasters, even more than commercial media outlets, must become transparent about their processes and how they make decisions,\u201d said Leonard Novy, a political scientist at the Institute for Media and Communication Policy in Cologne.\u201cWhether these institutions are able to survive in the future depends on this, because they are not simply accepted today as they were in the past,\u201d he added.The struggle to put the crime in its place was not limited to the broadcasters, however. Many traditional news media also questioned whether it should be treated as the terrible act of one individual, or said anything larger about clashes of culture and the integration of refugees in Germany society.\u201cA terrible crime happened in Freiburg,\u201d Reinhard M\u00fcller wrote in an editorial critical of ARD\u2019s decision in a conservative newspaper, The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which began covering the murder in November, after it was broadcast on a national television show about unsolved crimes.\u201cIt is of course debatable how these incidents should be covered. But is it really acceptable not to cover a crime because it has possibly been perpetrated by a young asylum seeker?\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller wrote.\u201cThat would mean that the German media are saying that they are not interested in stories that the German public is,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is a slippery slope.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gadget Apocalypse Is Upon Us", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtRemember gadgets?They were little electronic things that did stuff for you. They would play music or record videos or give you directions or let you play games on the go. They were fun. Everyone had them. Everyone wanted them. There were whole magazines and websites and even TV shows devoted to them.For 30 or 40 years, through recessions and war, through stability and revolutions, they were always there, one gadget after another, from transistor radios to TRS-80s to Walkmen and Gameboys, then iPods and Flips, GoPros and Fitbits. We were sure gadgets would always be with us, because they had always been with us, and it was good.What happened to gadgets? It\u2019s a fascinating story about tech progress, international manufacturing and shifting consumer preferences, and it all ends in a sad punch line: Great gadget companies are now having a harder time than ever getting off the ground. The gadget age is over \u2014 and even if that\u2019s a kind of progress, because software now fills many of our needs, the great gadgetapocalypse is bound to make the tech world, and your life, a little less fun.Things were never easy for gadgets. The lives of gadgets have always been nasty, brutish and short. One year a gadget would be the Must Have of the Year, and the next year it would be old news. But that was the cycle, and it was fine, because there would always be another gadget.Then things got even worse. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the Thing That Does Everything emerged from Cupertino, Calif. That was almost 10 years ago now. You know what I\u2019m talking about: the iPhone. We knew the Thing was going to be big, but we didn\u2019t know it would be this big. When the Thing threatened to eat up all the gadgets, nobody thought it would really happen. We still had hope that some gadgets would stick around.Much of this isn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cHardware is hard\u201d is an actual phrase that people in Silicon Valley say to pass for wise. What they mean is, starting a company that makes physical stuff has always been more perilous than starting a company that just makes code.That\u2019s why the hardware market has recently been ruled by big companies, either as stand-alone businesses for the likes of Apple and Samsung, or as a kind of come-on for other services. Amazon makes devices like the Kindle and the Echo as an accelerant to its content businesses and its Prime subscription program. Google and Microsoft appear more serious about hardware, and they both might turn devices into nice side businesses. But neither sees hardware as a primary moneymaker; the devices are mainly ways to get us to use more of their software.For start-ups, even in these days of easy contract manufacturing in China, gadgets involve a lot of costs \u2014 you need money for parts and a factory, and shipping and distribution, and you need virtually everything to go perfectly, because if your first gadget is a bust or has some fatal bug, you won\u2019t have a lot of money to make a second one. And even if your gadget is a success, it won\u2019t last long. The gadget economy is hits driven \u2014 you\u2019re only as good as your next big thing.And once you get a hit, you\u2019ll get hit by cheap knockoffs. Just before I went on a trip to Hawaii last year, I thought it would be fun to get a GoPro camera to record some pool stunts. But when I searched Amazon.com, I noticed a ton of generic \u201caction cameras\u201d that carried many of the same specs as the GoPros, at a steep discount on price. I ended up buying an SJCAM for $75, about half the price of the cheapest GoPro I could find. And you know what? It worked pretty well.This is the mixed blessing of cheaper manufacturing. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s much easier to be a hardware start-up than it ever was before, because the Shenzhen ecosystem gives you all the components you need,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, referring to the manufacturing hub Shenzhen, in southern China. \u201cBut that same ecosystem is available to everybody else, too, so setting yourself apart is really tough.\u201dYou might point out that the SJCAM I purchased lacked some of the finer qualities of a GoPro. Its software wasn\u2019t great, and it didn\u2019t offer customer support. If I were an extreme sports enthusiast, I might have cared about those deficiencies. For years, after all, GoPro managed to do very well among its niche audience of people who ride bikes in the snow while drinking Mountain Dew, or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re Xtreme. Other manufacturers tapped other niches \u2014 there are gadgets for running, hiking, walking and several other sports.But Mr. Dawson noted that eventually these companies reach the limit of their natural niche. Every sports enthusiast already has a GoPro \u2014 and that\u2019s when trouble begins. Because I\u2019m more of an extreme Twitter enthusiast than extreme sports guy, and because for me every gadget is essentially just an accessory to my smartphone, the cheaper knockoffs are usually fine for my purposes. This is likely to be the case for you, too.There is something sad about this. The gadget marketplace is the great laboratory of new tech. Gadget start-ups feed the entire tech ecosystem with new ideas. It\u2019s thanks to Pebble that we first saw the latent demand for smartwatches, and thanks to GoPro we realized that people really wanted to take videos of themselves doing underwater handstands. Would we ever have had the iPod if a bunch of start-ups in the late 1990s hadn\u2019t braved legal trouble to create portable MP3 players?But new stuff? Stuff we haven\u2019t seen before? Gadgets? They\u2019re gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Dominating Self-Driving Tech? Motor City Says Not So Fast", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byIn the race to develop self-driving cars, Michigan is suddenly aiming to give Silicon Valley a run for its money.The Motor City has been the center of the United States auto industry for more than a century. But as computer chips and software have become increasingly important in automobiles, Silicon Valley has seemed to take the lead, especially in the development of the supersmart cars of tomorrow.Google and Tesla, for example, have been at the forefront in creating cars with the ability to drive themselves. And many automakers have opened California outposts to become part of the high-tech scene. Uber and Lyft, the app-based ride-hailing services, are both based in San Francisco.But Michigan is trying to regain the high ground. General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are all engaged in autonomous vehicle projects based in Detroit\u2019s environs. And the state government is laying the ground for even more self-driving development work.The latest step came this month when Gov. Rick Snyder signed a package of laws to permit more extensive testing of self-driving cars on public roads, while clearing the way for use of autonomous vehicles in trials by ride-hailing services.\u201cWe are opening a new portal for autonomous technology,\u201d Mr. Snyder said in an interview. \u201cThis helps reinforce the message that Michigan is a place of innovation.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Nevada and Arizona are also vying to lure companies that are testing and developing self-driving cars. What\u2019s at stake is a potential economic boost \u2014 the millions of dollars automakers and others are spending on research and engineering, and the high-paying jobs they are creating.The city of Pittsburgh is also intent on competing with Detroit as a self-driving technopolis. Because of some pioneering research in self-driving technology at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh has emerged as a key development site.Even before Michigan passed its new laws, the state was gaining ground. Earlier this year Google\u2019s self-driving car project, now called Waymo, partnered with Fiat Chrysler to develop a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans and opened a technical office in Novi, Mich., near Detroit.The modified Pacifica vans, engineered in Michigan and assembled at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plant in Windsor, Ont., just across the river from Detroit, were delivered to Waymo on Monday. The two companies tested the first prototypes at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s proving grounds near Ann Arbor.The Canadian province of Ontario means to play its own big role in self-driving technology. Earlier this year, General Motors announced that it would create up to 1,000 engineering jobs, many focused on autonomous driving software development, in a suburb of Toronto. And this week Prime Minister Justin Trudeau officially opened BlackBerry\u2019s self-driving research center in Ottawa. It is based around a company formerly known QNX Software Systems, which has a long history as a supplier to auto companies.Back in Michigan, Ford is expanding its autonomous car efforts at its headquarters in Dearborn. It has built 30 self-driving cars and aims to have a fully automated car, with no steering wheel or pedals, in volume production by 2021. Ford intends for those cars to be first used in urban, ride-hailing fleets.The University of Michigan has created a 32-acre center for testing self-driving vehicles in Ann Arbor. Called MCity, the 32-acre facility has streets, intersections, traffic lights and road signs that provide a realistic environment where companies can hone autonomous vehicles before putting them on public roads.The university has also broken ground on a much larger, 335-acre site that was once the home of a World War II bomber factory.Michigan\u2019s new laws allow the testing of autonomous vehicles that have no steering wheel or gas and brake pedals. California prohibits testing of such cars on public roads. Michigan is also allowing more extensive testing of autonomous trucks traveling in groups or platoons.\u201cThere\u2019s the wrangling going on between the tech companies and the authorities in California over what is and what isn\u2019t allowed,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. \u201cMeanwhile, in Michigan, you get the sense that it\u2019s \u2018What can we do to help you?\u2019\u201dGeneral Motors, the nation\u2019s biggest automaker, said last week that it planned to soon begin testing its autonomous vehicles on Michigan roads. The company added that it would also build its first self-driving Chevrolet Bolts \u2014 already available as an all-electric car for human drivers \u2014 at an assembly plant in the Detroit suburb of Orion Township. G.M. is not saying when self-driving cars will be available for sale, but that it expects the Bolt will initially be for ride-hailing services.The addition of autonomous vehicles early next year may help secure the long-term future of the Orion Township plant, which makes the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact as well as the Bolt.G.M.\u2019s decision to centralize its production of self-driving models in Orion Township is a big step toward making Michigan a manufacturing hub for autonomous cars.\u201cWe expect to be the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass-production assembly plant,\u201d Mary Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, said at Friday\u2019s announcement.G.M. has already been testing autonomous Bolts at its technical center in Warren, Mich., as well as on public roads in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz.But Ms. Barra said Michigan\u2019s new law would help make the state the center of its winter-weather tests. \u201cBeing here where we can get the cold, snow and all the different weather conditions,\u201d she said, \u201cis very important.\u201dIan Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.Advertisement"}

It mobilized its technology for his defeat and warned of dire consequences if he should somehow win.Now that the impossible has happened, tech\u2019s day of reckoning is here \u2014 next Wednesday afternoon, to be precise. The president-elect is summoning leaders of the biggest tech companies to New York for a round-table discussion, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The agenda is undisclosed and perhaps still under consideration, but it is unlikely to produce the sort of love fest that existed between President Obama and Silicon Valley. Tech culture celebrates disruption as the tool that produces a better future for all. Many of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters, on the other hand, see it as pushing them down.Two Silicon Valley chief executives appeared willing to test the waters: Safra Catz, of the software maker Oracle, confirmed her participation in next week\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump. So did Chuck Robbins of Cisco Systems, the networking gear maker.Representatives for other leading tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple, declined to comment. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel has said in interviews that the benefits accruing to tech investors like himself should be more widely shared outside a few ZIP codes in New York and around San Francisco. One role of the meeting is to spur ideas for changing this situation. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment.In Apple\u2019s case, Mr. Trump has said he told its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, in late November that he wants the company to build \u201ca big plant\u201d in the United States \u2014 or even better, \u201cmany big plants.\u201dApple itself does not do any manufacturing in the United States. A contractor, Flex, manufactures high-end desktop computers on its behalf in Austin, Tex., employing about 2,000 people. A vast majority of Apple\u2019s production is in China, where there is an enormous ecosystem devoted to it. Many economists say that reproducing such an interlocking web of suppliers here would push the cost of iPhones up considerably.Mr. Trump also tangled with Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, during the campaign, saying that Mr. Bezos has \u201ca huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dIf there are some overtures being made in Silicon Valley, there are also some lines being drawn.Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week\u2019s meeting: defiance.\u201cIf an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company\u2019s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him,\u201d Mr. Sacca said.Or perhaps everyone will get along fine. Some in Silicon Valley speculate that the rough moments between Mr. Trump and the tech industry come not because they are so different but because they are at the bottom so similar.\u201cTrump embodies the harsher aspects of Silicon Valley \u2014 a brash and arrogant disrupter, convinced that the world is all wrong as it is and only he can change it for the better,\u201d said Shiva Ramesh, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious-yet-vague plans have a familiar ring. \u201cSounds like the pitch of some start-ups: \u2018It is all there in my head and in a one-page plan, it will all work out, I can do it, trust me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.Advertisement"}

(The tally had hit 42,000 by Sunday.)As Mr. Trump tries to burn the media village down, he may just be saving it.His running campaign of Twitter attacks, declarations of failure and vows to punish the traditional news media is threatening to do what so many years of cost-cutting and re-envisioning could not do as easily: put the industry on more solid economic footing, where customers who realize its value are willing to pay for it more regularly.It\u2019s early. And, in traditional media, hope is the province of masochists.It\u2019s as if Mr. Trump\u2019s media attacks have combined with the heightened attention on the perils of fake news to create one big fat advertisement for the value of basic journalism.\u201cThe fake news business is going to be great for journalism in the long run,\u201d Mr. Carter told me Friday, referring to Mr. Trump as \u201cthe Fake Newser in Chief.\u201d \u201cProper news organizations should thrive under this.\u201dTo do so, though, journalism is going to have to find its inner Taylor Swift.The music industry might seem like an odd place for people in the hard news game to turn. But, like the news industry, it had spent the better part of this century preparing its obituary as the web made it easy for people to listen to so much music without paying for it.Now, think of the readers as Apple in the showdown with Ms. Swift. In many cases, they\u2019ve been getting news for free that other people pay for through subscriptions. That is because newspapers for so long gave it all away for nothing, only to face dire economic consequences when players like Facebook and Google showed up to gobble up the online advertising market. That put the onus back onto selling subscriptions.As the country and the world head into this confusing new era, news organizations are in a position to make a newly urgent pitch: Buying a subscription is tantamount to supporting the pillars of democracy. It\u2019s about maintaining the sort of reporting that debunks fake news, holds power accountable and keeps the nation on course in its own imperfect way.Real reporting costs real money. But newsrooms, saddled with big losses in advertising revenue, are continuing to contract, even with huge online circulation gains.Now comes an openly press-hostile new president who is entering office not only attacking the news media publicly on Twitter but signaling that he may fundamentally alter the way the executive branch views its obligations to the press.It would be spilled milk to most Americans, who probably don\u2019t care which reporter sits where. But the symbolism is important. Since the early 1980s, successive Republican and Democratic administrations have left seating assignments to the White House Correspondents Association because they were \u201cmindful of the potential appearance of playing favorites if they assigned the seats themselves,\u201d as Jeff Mason, the association president, said last week.One candidate for the press secretary job, the chief Republican Party spokesman, Sean Spicer, told Megyn Kelly of Fox News last week that Mr. Trump would not shut reporters out. But he did say a Trump White House might move away from having daily press briefings.If it does so that would be part of a trend in which politicians and others in power try to push traditionally trained reporters out of the way.Just look at the way Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is supporting a fast-tracked and bipartisan bill that would economically devastate newspapers in the state by ending the legal requirement that state and local agencies place their legal notices in print papers.Good reporters know how to get past politicians\u2019 information blockades. But it can take resources.That\u2019s where the new subscriptions come in. If they keep growing \u2014 sure, a big if \u2014 they could bring what The Los Angeles Times\u2019s editor in chief and publisher, Davan Maharaj, called \u201ca new golden era in journalism.\u201d\u201cWithout a doubt, citizens of the United States are valuing newspapers and trusted, verified, distinctive journalism once again,\u201d he told me last week.It\u2019s probably not the result Mr. Trump is looking for. Then again, you never know.A peace envoy?Maybe not, Mr. Carter said, surmising that the younger Mr. Trump was there \u201cto check the place out to see if it was empty.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t, fortunately.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That change had begun to occur after the earlier Charlie Hebdo attack \u2014 something noted by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who named 2016 the Year of the \u201cMarseillaise.\u201dThis month, about 100 academics, government officials and military personnel gathered at a daylong conference at the French Defense Ministry to help mark an end to that commemoration. They debated the song\u2019s meaning, especially its climax that calls on people to \u201cwater the fields with impure blood\u201d (the debate was over whose blood it was). They discussed how its melody had inspired revolutionaries from Russia to Chile. And they listened to countless versions of it, a feminist \u201cMarseillaise\u201d going down particularly well (its chorus \u2014 \u201cTremble, tremble, jealous husbands\u201d \u2014 was met with laughter).Jean-Marc Todeschini, who is responsible for veteran affairs at the Defense Ministry, said that the Year of the Marseillaise was declared precisely so that the French, especially the young, could re-appropriate the republican values of the song, which was written by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in 1792 during the French Revolution.\u201cI am thinking in particular of freedom, resistance and fraternity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt belongs to all the French, not to one political party or sectarian ideology. It\u2019s important in the current context of terrorism and risk to our social cohesion to unite all French people around our hymn.\u201dAt the same time that the government has been promoting its reappropriation, others in France have been debating the value of the song \u2014 and its ability to unite \u2014 in less formal settings.\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with the mentality of singing it,\u201d said Philippe Fragione, better known as Akhenaton, one of France\u2019s most popular rappers. \u201cI\u2019m from Marseilles and there\u2019s always been a feeling there that we have to rebel against the state. My view changed a bit after the attacks when people in other countries were singing it \u2014 that showed solidarity \u2014 but sometimes politicians and fake philosophers use it to point out differences, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201dMagyd Cherfi, a French-Algerian writer and frontman of the band Zebda, said that in his view, \u201cthings have evolved in France\u201d over the past year, changing people\u2019s relationship to the country and the anthem. \u201cFear lives on every street now and people lose confidence in the nation. They take refuge in extremes.\u201dHe feels the same connection today, he said, but seems less certain about the anthem. \u201cThe Marseillaise is lost in modernity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt addresses the French of more than two centuries ago. I think it is good to change the text to make it more universal, because now France\u2019s children are black, Asian, North African. They must find themselves in it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really a fan of the tune, but it was the version by Berlioz, and it was most beautiful I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d he said. He buried his daughter on the same day. \u201cI can\u2019t separate it from those memories now. It\u2019s taken a different meaning to me, beyond an anthem.\u201dHe said the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d has probably helped unite the country since the attacks thanks to its lyrics \u201cagainst tyranny, absolutism and intolerance.\u201dHe said he understood why some disliked it, since he used to share many of their reservations. But he disagrees with calls to change the words. \u201cI don\u2019t like this idea of correcting pieces of art for political correctness purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are racist phrases in \u2018Tom Sawyer,\u2019 but you will not change \u2018Tom Sawyer.\u2019 \u201dThe Year of the Marseillaise has not put questions of national identity at its forefront, preferring initiatives focused on educating children about the anthem\u2019s origins.Speakers at the conference this month agreed that the anthem was playing perhaps its largest role since World War II, when it helped motivate people against German invaders and the collaborationist Vichy government.\u201cIn recent years, the Front National were the only party to use these republican symbols,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Dr\u00e9villon, a professor of modern history at Paris 1 university, referring to the far-right party. \u201cThe attacks gave legitimacy to the other parties to re-appropriate it.\u201dAll the candidates for next year\u2019s French presidential election have been singing it at rallies, he added.But several speakers noted that some in France were still uncomfortable with the anthem. They either find its lyrics calling citizens \u201cto arms\u201d outdated and violent, or find the line about \u201cimpure blood\u201d inflammatory given France\u2019s colonial history. French-Algerians and Corsicans booed the anthem at football matches in the 2000s.Mathieu Schwartz, a documentary maker who spoke at the conference, said such objections were not about \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d itself. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different from other national hymns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a problem with the nation, you have a problem with it. If you changed the music or words, you\u2019d still have a problem.\u201dIsmael El Iraki, a Moroccan filmmaker who has been living in Paris for 15 years and escaped the Bataclan during the attacks, said the lyrics did not need to be changed.\u201cThat infamous line about impure blood is my favorite,\u201d he said, sharing an unusual interpretation from his high school history teacher: Rouget de Lisle was calling on people to shed their own impure blood in defense of the French Revolution \u2014 purity having been something previously associated with the aristocracy.\u201cThat\u2019s why I love the \u2018Marseillaise,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIn a moment in history where purity is used as a horrible goal by jihadists and right-wing fear mongers alike, I think it\u2019s a cool line to keep in mind, reminding us that impurity is our own, and our strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The group describes itself as \u201cadvisers to the nation.\u201d The advice often comes through written reports from scientific committees organized by the group.Critics say that several committee members have financial ties to biotech businesses that could color the panel\u2019s report, expected to be published soon, potentially giving short shrift to health and environmental worries.In addition, an employee at the academies who helped pick the scientists to serve on the panel was pursuing a different job while he put together his recommendations for the group. Three of the 13 people he recommended \u2014 all of whom were eventually selected for the panel \u2014 were board members at his new employer, a new biotechnology nonprofit.The National Academies have defended the panel that produced the May report, as well as the current panel on biotechnology, saying that the type of expertise needed to staff them is limited and thus some conflict must be tolerated.But people with ties to the academies say any perceived conflicts of interest may undermine some of the group\u2019s authority.\u201cThere\u2019s often a lot riding on what the academies say, and so their ability to act with objectivity and independence defines any value they have,\u201d said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, a former leader of what is now the medical division of the National Academies.The most recent committee convened to study biotechnology was formed this year at the behest of the White House. The group was asked to predict what new technologies might arise over the next 15 years and advise the government on how to oversee them. The regulation for the industry was last updated in 1992, years before the first approval of genetically engineered seeds, which are now widely used by farmers.Like the 200 or so other reports published by the National Academies each year, the biotechnology report is undergoing peer review, the quality-control process regularly used by academic journals.The report could have broad implications for the industry. Big food companies like Coca-Cola and Archer Daniels Midland, for instance, have invested in synthetic biology, a term used for the more sophisticated genetic engineering now coming into use that was the panel\u2019s area of study. Food companies are exploring its use in creating flavorings and sweeteners.When the National Academies announced the committee this year, they disclosed that two of the group\u2019s 13 scientists had ties to the biotech industry that violated the organization\u2019s conflict-of-interest policy. Such disclosures are rare for the academies, said William Kearney, a spokesman for the organization, but scientists with conflicts are sometimes allowed to work on a committee when the academies think the scientist has a specialty or knowledge that cannot be found elsewhere.Mr. Kearney would not, however, provide data on how frequently the academies have to disclose such conflicts, saying only that they are \u201crare.\u201dThe two scientists with conflicts are Dr. Steven Evans, a scientist at Dow AgroSciences, a major biotechnology company, and Jeffrey Wolt, a professor at Iowa State University, who the academies said has investments in a company that could benefit from the study\u2019s results. The academies noted their conflicts when the panel members were announced.Dr. Evans and Professor Wolt referred questions about their role to Mr. Kearney. Mr. Kearney said the disclosed conflicts of interest were discovered during the usual vetting of panel members by the academies. The academies kept the scientists on the panel, he said, because they could not find anyone with the same expertise.But more than three dozen environmental and health advocates argue that the National Academies also allowed several other scientists with potential financial conflicts onto the panel without any disclosures.\u201cSeveral members of this committee stand to benefit directly or indirectly from the rules and regulations their recommendations will help shape,\u201d said Tim Schwab, a food researcher at Food & Water Watch, an advocacy group leading the group of critics. \u201cNor does the committee include anyone who might advocate a more judicious approach to regulating the industry.\u201dProfessor Isaacs referred questions to Mr. Kearney.Mr. Kearney said all conflicts that violate the academies\u2019 conflict-of-interest policy had been disclosed when the panel was announced. Professor Isaacs, he said, did not have a conflict that required disclosure because his company\u2019s technologies are not now being used in biotech.\u201cThe term \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 applies only to current interests, not prospective ones,\u201d Mr. Kearney said. He said the same about similar questions raised about other members of the committee by the group of critics.(One panel member resigned: Richard Johnson, a former partner at Arnold & Porter, a law firm that counts many biotech companies as clients. Mr. Kearney attributed the decision to scheduling conflicts.)But while Mr. Friedman, who has degrees in chemistry and chemical biology, was putting together his recommendations, he was also applying for a leadership job in the biotech world.In January, Mr. Friedman widely distributed an email seeking nominations for the panel. The email was one of many digital records about Mr. Friedman and the panel that were discovered by Food & Water Watch. The group found the records, including the emails and spreadsheets, through Google searches of the panel\u2019s members and shared them with The New York Times, which repeated the search and also found the documents. The records have since been removed from the websites where they had been cached.According to the digital records discovered online, Mr. Friedman was firmly on the nonprofit\u2019s radar as a possible leader by the time he began his search for members for the National Academies panel. Ginni Ursin, a Monsanto executive on the nonprofit\u2019s board, commented on a spreadsheet dated December 2015 that Mr. Friedman was the \u201ctop candidate by a decent margin.\u201dThe 13 scientists Mr. Friedman recommended to his superiors at the National Academies \u2014 including three members of the nonprofit\u2019s board \u2014 were all ultimately approved, he said.The panel was appointed in April, and in July, Mr. Friedman started as the new executive director of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium.In a phone interview, he said that he pursued the new job while helping to put the panel together but did not see any reason to tell the academies about the job search. He said he was only one of many layers in the process of appointing members to the biotech panel. And he said it was a coincidence that so many committee members also have roles at the nonprofit.\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively small community of people involved in the biotech space,\u201d he said.But Mr. Kearney of the National Academies said Mr. Friedman should not have played the role he did in the selection of the committee in the midst of a job search he did not disclose. The National Academies, he said, are reviewing the selection process, including the oversight of the staff members who oversee it.\u201cNo staff member,\u201d he said, \u201cshould be participating in the appointment of a committee with members who are also on the board of an organization with which he or she is negotiating employment.\u201dA chart on Dec. 28 with article about potential conflicts of interest among members named to a biotechnology panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, using information erroneously posted on the website of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium, referred incorrectly to Mary Maxon and David Rejeski, two of the 13 members of the panel. They do not have any connection to the consortium. As a result, seven of the members of the panel have potential conflicts of interest, not nine. The article, using the same information from the website, misstated the number of people connected to the consortium who are also members of the biotechnology panel.

President Obama had just announced that he would be closing a \u201cRussian compound\u201d in New York that had been used for intelligence gathering \u2014 and several administration officials pointed to Killenworth, which is in Glen Cove, as the target in New York.But by late Friday morning, it had become clear that the Obama administration had set its retaliatory sights not on Killenworth but on property here in Upper Brookville, home of the less conspicuous of the mansions that the Russian government is known to own on Long Island\u2019s exclusive North Shore.The confusion over which Long Island estate was to be closed had its roots in internal White House meetings in recent days in which senior officials erroneously referred to the targeted retreat as \u201cthe Glen Cove location.\u201dEarly Friday morning, the White House officials continued to insist that the mansion in Glen Cove was the one being closed. They eventually acknowledged their mistake after the mayor of Upper Brookville said it was the estate in his village that was in fact being emptied.By 11 a.m. Friday, the confusion appeared to have been settled, with just an hour to go before the deadline the federal government had set for the properties to be closed.A few vans and cars, all with diplomatic license plates, began rolling down the driveway of the property in this village, where a mansion, not easily seen from the main road, sits on a 14-acre spread of wooded hills.The vehicles\u2019 occupants, who appeared to be mostly middle-aged men and women, would not lower their windows to speak to the reporters who had gathered along the road. But a few of them waved as they departed.The caravan was one of the first public signs of Mr. Obama\u2019s response to his administration\u2019s allegations of Russian hacking and meddling in the presidential election.The estate was purchased by the Soviet diplomatic mission to the United Nations as a weekend retreat in 1952. Known as the Norwich House, the residence had once been the home to Nathan L. Miller, governor of New York from 1921-1922.But around here, no one seemed to know precisely who was inside the vehicles, least of all the neighbors who were only dimly aware that the estate belonged to Russian diplomats.And it was not entirely clear what, if any effect \u2014 symbolic or practical \u2014 closing the Long Island estate would have. This was, after all, not even the primary weekend home of Russian diplomats in New York, but the secondary one.Not long after the midday deadline, most of the federal agents who had been stationed at the estate drove to a nearby sandwich shop, mission apparently accomplished. The local police officer left behind to guard the driveway said that as far as he knew, the only regular residents of the estate were the groundskeepers. A neighbor across the street said that in an entire year, he had not seen a single car coming or going up that driveway, until Friday.The estate was purchased by the Soviet diplomatic mission to the United Nations as a weekend retreat in 1952. Known as the Norwich House, the residence had once been the home to Nathan L. Miller, governor of New York from 1921-1922.In a statement, Mr. Obama said the Russian estate in New York that had been targeted for closure, along with a second one in Maryland, had been \u201cused by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes,\u201d but he did not elaborate.The mayor of Upper Brookville, Elliot S.

The Jet.com founder Marc Lore \u2014 now Walmart\u2019s head of e-commerce \u2014 had the right ambition. He planned to compete with Amazon on price, but hit a speed bump after Jet was forced to drop its annual membership fee shortly after its start. Still, Mr. Lore\u2019s past success with the sale of the company behind Diapers.com to Amazon shows he knows how to get the online giant\u2019s attention.Jet is already helping bolster sales. Digital revenue jumped 20 percent year-over-year in the three months ended in October, nearly double the 12 percent growth notched in the previous quarter, before Walmart closed the Jet deal.Along with buying Jet, Walmart took a 10 percent stake in China\u2019s JD.com and may be eyeing a similar deal with Flipkart of India. It is targeting a 20 to 30 percent compound annual growth rate in e-commerce over the next three years as it prioritizes online sales over new store openings.Any growth will be from a low base, however. Online revenue represents about 3 percent of some annual $480 billion in top line.There are other points of weakness, too. Amazon is easier to use, with better shipping options and the world\u2019s biggest online inventory. Walmart scores lower on WPP\u2019s BrandZ list of the most valuable global brands, notching at No. 32 versus Amazon\u2019s seventh place. The Alphabet unit Google places first. The survey also showed Walmart lagging Amazon in customer service in important categories like electronics. That\u2019s important: A separate analysis found that the top 30 brands in 2016 outperformed the global MSCI index over the last five years.With Jet\u2019s charismatic founder now sweating such details, Walmart\u2019s attempt to catch up to Amazon should gather pace in 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Founder of Odwalla Tries to Recapture His Mojo", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cOdwalla took him to the top of the world and then to the bottom,\u201d said Berne Evans, his business partner today. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever gotten over it.\u201dToday it\u2019s possible for a company to develop a drink and cut a deal with an assembly line for hire to produce it, and negotiate another deal for someone to distribute it. Just a decade ago, it required far more capital and, eventually, a sprawling operation.Only a few years after its founding, in 2012, Califia is on track to ring up $100 million in sales and is adding products at a fast clip. The company is considered one of the hottest young brands in the beverage world, leading to whispers about whether one of the big competitors will soon swoop in with a buyout offer that Mr. Steltenpohl and his partners can\u2019t refuse.Not this time, he insists. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sell out once,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cThat was enough.\u201dThat\u2019s easier to say than to do. A little more than a month ago, Ben Weiss, the founder of the flavored water company Bai, also brushed back talk of a buyout. \u201cIt\u2019s called Bai, not Sell,\u201d he said in an interview at the time.His argument was not unique these days. He had already teamed up to a degree with one competitor. The company\u2019s drinks, which it called \u201cenhanced waters,\u201d got some distribution from Dr Pepper. And Bai was outselling a competitor in retail stores: Over the previous 12 weeks, Bai had outsold Vitaminwater, a Coke brand, for the first time, Mr. Weiss said.It was on track for $300 million in annual sales, outselling Pepsi and Coke on Amazon, internet sales that help many young beverage companies extend their reach to far corners of the country without giant distribution networks.There are more opportunities for young drinks companies than ever, as consumers who have abandoned sugary and diet sodas search for alternatives to plain water. Hint Inc., for instance, is on track to ring up $90 million in sales this year, having leveraged its early distribution in Google\u2019s cafeterias into shelf space at Whole Foods, Target and other stores.Last month, Cason Thorsby, a newly minted entrepreneur in Detroit, began selling in restaurants, bars and groceries there a line of sugar-free, naturally flavored, \u201csuperinfused\u201d sodas branded with his first name. And new juice businesses like OnJuice, Misfit Juicery and Roots Juices, many of which start out selling their products online, come to life every month, or so it seems.Duane Stanford, the editor of Beverage Digest, said a young beverage company today can buy its flavors from a flavor house, branding expertise from a branding expert and manufacturing from a producer on contract.\u201cYou have this situation where these companies can become viable, robust, cash-generating businesses without the help of a big company,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re even getting creative at building independent distribution networks.\u201dOdwalla came together out of a necessity to eat. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in environmental sciences, Mr. Steltenpohl joined with some friends to start a band called the Stance. He also got hooked on the taste of fresh-squeezed orange juice, which his father made for him.\u201cWe were a band of musicians who weren\u2019t really that accomplished \u2014 or popular,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said of himself and the band members, who became his partners in Odwalla. \u201cWe were broke and starving, and we figured if we started a juice business, we could live off the juice and maybe make a little extra.\u201dHe read a book, \u201c100 Businesses You Can Start For $100,\u201d and the partners invested in a juicer and started making juice. They didn\u2019t even try to break into groceries and convenience stores, instead stocking refrigerators in video stores and laundromats with Odwalla fresh juice each day. \u201cEveryone who was a musician back then was basically living out of a VW bus,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cWe quit living in ours and began selling juice out of the back.\u201dFor most of its early years, the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union financed the company. But as consumers cottoned on to its intensely flavored, wacky mixes of unpasteurized juice, it needed something more.A friend introduced Mr. Steltenpohl to Bill Hambrecht, a founder of Hambrecht & Quist, the investment bank that financed some of Silicon Valley\u2019s early start-ups. Hambrecht & Quist became Odwalla\u2019s first institutional investor, and Mr. Hambrecht began serving as a sort of consigliere. \u201cHe helped us understand that anarchy isn\u2019t the best business model,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.In 1993, Hambrecht & Quist helped take Odwalla public, which allowed it to expand nationally and into Canada. By 1996, it had roughly $60 million in sales, a new plant and refrigerated delivery trucks to replace the VW vans.Then the music stopped.\u201cI got a call from the King County department of health,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl whispered, tearing up at the memory. \u201cFive or six people in Seattle had come down with what looked like E. coli poisoning, and the common element was apple juice, our apple juice.\u201dIn the end, at least 66 people got sick after drinking Odwalla juice, and a child died. The brand\u2019s claims about the healthiness came back to haunt it as reporters dug into its failure to heed warnings about food-safety lapses.Odwalla ended up in the hands of private equity groups, and when it became apparent that the goal was to sell the company to Coca-Cola, Mr. Steltenpohl left.\u201cFor Coke, the thinking was fresh juice is becoming important, we need a fresh juice, Odwalla will fill that need,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never saw the enormous potential of the Odwalla brand and instead saw it as just another product in the juice portfolio.\u201d(Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Coke, said that Odwalla is an important part of what the company calls its \u201cnatural healthy beverages portfolio and that Coke would continue to invest in marketing and new products to grow the brand.\u201d)Mr. Steltenpohl then teamed up with Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, and started a payment system that rewarded loyalty to local businesses.Then he collaborated with an African entrepreneur to develop Adina, a hibiscus tea business now owned by a Mexican beverage company. \u201cIt was a pretty ambitious project to source hibiscus from a women\u2019s co-op in Africa and make it into teas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of prejudice, and it was difficult to get any margin on the product \u2014 it was so idealistic.\u201dMr. Steltenpohl was charged with building and operating the plant that would squeeze the misfit fruit into juice. But just as construction began on the plant in Bakersfield, Calif., Mr. Evans\u2019s partner in Cuties, the agricultural group now known as the Wonderful Company, backed out. \u201cWithout its clementines to run the plant, we couldn\u2019t run it efficiently,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIn other words, we overbuilt the plant.\u201dSo Mr. Steltenpohl returned to an idea he had toyed with many years before.Shortly after the E. coli contamination, Odwalla had tried selling a product called Future Shake that was made from almonds, oats and soy. But its texture was too thick, and it never took off.\u201cAt that point, I really wasn\u2019t thinking of returning to the company at all,\u201d he said.But after the surgery, the hospital gave him a protein beverage to aid in his recovery, and the ingredients in it were so bad that he decided he had to make Califia work.The first batch of almond milk rolled off the production line in 2012 and quickly took off.The product had the advantage of its own production facility and what Mr. Steltenpohl had learned about distribution while at Odwalla. It also had the advantage of a far different retail landscape. When the Odwalla crisis hit, Amazon was in its infancy, and Whole Foods, which often serves as a sort of ambassador for new food and beverage brands, had just a handful of stores.Today, Amazon is putting up its own grocery stores, and Whole Foods has nearly 500 stores. At the same time, convenience stores have become much bigger points of distribution for a wide variety of drinks.And consumers are abandoning traditional soft drinks, both sugared and diet, in droves and searching for new flavors delivered in new ways.In the last year, Mr. Steltenpohl has pushed almond milk drinks flavored with things like ginger, mocha and matcha. More recently, Califia is putting the almond milk into cold-brewed and nitrogen-infused coffees, a technique borrowed from the beer business. The nitrogen imparts a sweetness to coffee, helping to reduce the amount of sugar needed. According to data from Euromonitor, bottled coffee is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in America, and Califia\u2019s cold-brewed version outsells the packaged Starbucks version.Mr. Steltenpohl is also trying to avoid past mistakes. The plant is equipped with cutting-edge food-safety monitors that share alerts about problems as they happen with the entire senior management team. Josh Butt, who previously oversaw food safety systems at Danone, the big French dairy company, presides over the plant\u2019s operations.In the year ended Sept. 4, Califia\u2019s sales more than doubled, hitting $85 million, according to data from IRI, which does not include the bottled coffee.In other words, the company is big enough to be attractive to a larger player.\u201cAs for big-brand interest, it would be accurate to say there has already been substantial interest \u2014 but as I\u2019ve said, I really don\u2019t want to go that route of selling while the company is so relatively young,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cFinding ways to continue to grow the company into a major brand with a high degree of independence is a major lifelong objective.\u201dPrivate equity groups have also come calling. One year ago, the Stripes Group, a Manhattan-based private equity group that has a stake in the food delivery service Blue Apron, among other businesses, put up $50 million for a little less than 20 percent of Califia\u2019s stock, giving the company a value of more than $250 million.Mr. Steltenpohl and his executive team have options giving them the right to as much as a quarter of the company, and Mr. Evans owns the rest \u2014 a majority of the business \u2014 but \u201cit\u2019s really Greg\u2019s company,\u201d he said, adding that he was in no hurry to exit his investment. (Mr. Evans declined to comment on whether he earned money from the Stripes Group transaction.)That said, the tried-and-true endgame of selling out to a big competitor could prove too inviting, particularly in the wake of Danone\u2019s purchase of WhiteWave this year.The advantages that deal brought to WhiteWave have caused some sleepless nights for Mr. Steltenpohl, even though sales of his competitor\u2019s almond milk have been flat. Danone has the wherewithal to pay slotting fees to supermarkets to bump products into prime positions on the refrigerated shelves, regardless of how well they are selling.\u201cThat makes it harder for us younger dogs,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.But he said chains like Target and Kroger are relying more on what he called \u201cfact based\u201d assessment to determine where they put products on their shelves. And he hints that Califia will introduce a \u201ccultured product\u201d some time next year \u2014 read: something probiotic. Which may just give Danone reason to watch its back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Advertising\u2019s Moral Struggle: Is Online Reach Worth the Hurt?", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byAdvertising on the internet has never been easier. Data and automation increasingly allow companies large and small to reach millions of people every month, and to tailor ads to specific groups based on their browsing habits or demographics.Now, however, the marketing industry is facing a moral quandary in the face of a national debate over the role that fake news played in the presidential election and the realization that many websites that promote false and misleading stories are motivated by the money they can make from online advertising.\u201cI would much rather pay a little premium as a brand and go for verified sites,\u201d Raja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer of MasterCard, said, noting that the company mostly advertised on sites it had evaluated and approved. \u201cBut it\u2019s a question again of how much and where. And I think all brands are doing this soul-searching at this point in time.\u201dThe problem is, most advertisers do not have the size or the financial wherewithal of MasterCard to simply opt out of the automated system as it now exists. And even if they do, there are tantalizing financial incentives to stay put.Much online advertising capitalizes on the lure of the so-called long tail of the internet \u2014 sites that draw relatively small but attractive audiences, like blogs for new parents or forums for truck enthusiasts. Advertising on those sites costs a fraction of what it does on more prominent online destinations, which typically deal directly with advertisers.Money is funneled to smaller sites through a complex system of agencies and third-party networks, which can resemble a stock exchange. This system, known as programmatic advertising, allows brands to collect many millions of impressions \u2014 an industry term that generally indicates that an ad has been displayed and can be viewed.Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said the system, set up to reward clicks and impressions, had fueled the growth of low-quality sites well beyond those focused on made-up political news.\u201cHonestly, the long tail is to advertising what subprime was to mortgages,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s in it, but it helps people believe that there is a mysterious tonnage of impressions that are really low cost. But low-cost impressions would mean low-cost human attention. How can any publisher of quality content survive on low-cost impressions?\u201dMarc Goldberg, chief executive of Trust Metrics, an ad safety vendor, said the effort to remove bad actors ignored the fact that many advertisers value impressions over everything else. They would rather not choose and monitor what websites they are appearing on, he said, because they worry they will miss out on potentially lucrative destinations.\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is introducing all of these bad sites into our ecosystem and not having the means to monitor them appropriately and effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big problem in our industry is our expectations of scale are not aligned with reality.\u201dRelatively speaking, the money going to fake political news is minuscule, but it has taken on outsize significance because it reflects a world in which marketers are often not paying attention to where their ads show up.\u201cA lot of ad buying systems are trying to show the right ad to the right person at the right time, and you see that mantra of those three variables across the industry,\u201d said Michael Tiffany, the chief executive and a founder of White Ops, an ad fraud detection company. \u201cNote how \u2018on the right site\u2019 doesn\u2019t make the list.\u201dIt is also watching out for its ads on fake news sites, which can slip through the cracks. Workable has about 110 employees and 6,000 customers but advertises on more than 50,000 sites a month through Google.\u201cTypically, Google has done a good job of keeping us off of low-quality sites,\u201d said John Short, vice president for demand generation at Workable.He added, \u201cWith fake news sites, or whatever you would like to call them, we need to be more alert.\u201dThis month, Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corporation, which owns The Wall Street Journal, described the digital ad market as \u201cdysfunctional.\u201dAd agencies, Mr. Thomson said at a conference held by UBS, should be \u201cresponsible for the audiences that they\u2019re creating, and then what they\u2019re serving those audiences and how they\u2019re serving those clients, because we\u2019ve sort of gone from the era of \u2018Mad Men\u2019 to mad metrics.\u201dInstead of using television networks, newspapers and magazines as proxies for reaching certain groups of people, many media buyers have been trained by automated advertising to use data and technology.Andrew Casale, the chief executive of Index Exchange, an advertising exchange, estimated that all the titles owned by the top 50 traditional media companies, including The Washington Post, Hearst and Cond\u00e9 Nast, probably accounted for 5 percent or less of the trillions of ad impressions available for sale each day.Overall spending on automated banner displays and video ads will grow to $18.7 billion this year worldwide, and the United States will account for half of that, according to Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\u201cThe problem, I think, for marketers is they\u2019ve been trained to value media universally,\u201d Mr. Casale said. \u201cFake news sites have really, really low prices and rates and tons of scale, so it\u2019s almost like a drug.\u201dMr. Tiffany, of White Ops, described one lure of automated buying. Say an advertiser wants to reach readers of The Atlantic or The New York Times who are in the market for a car. A relatively nondescript site might offer a price for 1,000 impressions that is one-fifteenth to one-twentieth what The Atlantic or The Times would charge, promising to deliver the same people who read The Atlantic or The Times, just later in the day.Mr. Thomson said he expected such programmatic advertising to come under even greater scrutiny.\u201cI would expect not only there\u2019s an existential debate about news and fake news,\u201d he said at the UBS conference, \u201cbut for that to flow into an existential debate about the role of advertising in society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Join Our Board: Companies Hotly Pursue New Wave of Women in Tech", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For months, technology companies have pursued Amy Chang.\u201cI turned down 15 to 20 first meetings\u201d about joining a company board this year, said Ms. Chang, 39, who was an executive at Google for seven years before founding Accompany, which makes an executive-briefing app. \u201cThis whole thing is so crazy.\u201dEven by Silicon Valley standards, where recruiting wars are legion, attracting women to join tech company boards has become intense. While many companies still want the highest-profile women in the industry \u2014 think Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook or Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise \u2014 a new pool of candidates is also being hotly pursued. And those women are younger, tend to be ethnically diverse and have grown up in digital businesses for much of their careers.\u201cBoards are looking at diversity across multiple dimensions, such as gender, ethnicity, age and unique skill sets,\u201d said David Chun, the chief executive of Equilar, which tracks board candidates and executive compensation. \u201cIf you can bring a number of these different attributes and perspectives to the boardroom, you\u2019ll be in high demand.\u201dThe clamor for these women has spread beyond Silicon Valley\u2019s large public tech companies to privately held start-ups as well, some of which could emerge as the next public giants. Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, a closely held online real estate brokerage, said he sometimes had to mount \u201cpitched efforts\u201d to attract female candidates to his company\u2019s nine-member board, because many other start-up chief executives were after the same people.\u201cA lot of executives are trying to do this,\u201d Mr. Kelman said. \u201cIf I dillydallied, suddenly everyone was recruiting\u201d the same person.Ms. Bornstein, 46, a former chief digital officer at Sephora, said she had gotten 30 or 40 calls to discuss joining a corporate board over the last few years, even though she had never sat on one. Before becoming a member of Redfin\u2019s board, Ms. Bornstein said, she also talked to two public companies about a board spot, though she lost out to other women for those positions.Yet many hurdles still prevent women from joining more tech boards, Ms. Bornstein said. As she interviewed at companies about board seats, she said, she found that many directors typically stuck to their own networks of acquaintances for candidates. That generally led to looking at the same people over and over again.As a rule of thumb, boards also want experienced members. Part of the reason Ms. Bornstein said she did not land other board positions was because \u201cthey couldn\u2019t get their head around someone who hadn\u2019t been on a board before.\u201d Because there are \u201cfewer natural high-profile women in tech,\u201d she said, \u201cit requires taking bets on new people.\u201dTheBoardlist now has 1,300 names, up from 600 when the effort began, Ms. Singh Cassidy said. Less than half of those on the list have prior board experience, reflecting the up-and-coming nature of the group. Companies seeking a female board member can search through the list for ideas.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of educating that needs to be done,\u201d said Ms. Singh Cassidy, who is on the boards of TripAdvisor and Ericsson. But she said she was encouraged that some of the larger tech companies had embraced board diversity, which has spilled over to start-ups. \u201cThere has been pressure from all parts of the ecosystem, which has created a groundswell,\u201d she said.In the end, it often takes a chief executive to be open-minded about recruiting a different type of board member. That is what happened with Ms. Chang at Cisco.That kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is atypical of board members at Cisco, where directors tend to be more experienced. The company\u2019s longtime board members include John L. Hennessy, 64, the former president of Stanford University, and Carol Bartz, 68, the former chief executive of Yahoo.Yet Ms. Chang\u2019s differences were precisely what drew Chuck Robbins, Cisco\u2019s chief executive. After seeing the Accompany app this year and learning about Ms. Chang, he met with her and they hit it off. Ms. Chang soon interviewed with other Cisco board members, who concluded she would be an asset, Mr. Robbins said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s all about bringing on fresh perspectives and a different set of experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means they bring a different set of thinking to the boardroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s newly named kitchen cabinet of business advisers, Wall Street is in. Silicon Valley is out.Mr. Trump has named 16 business leaders to serve on what\u2019s being called the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, described as a group meant to guide his administration on economic matters.The list is notable for leaning toward New York executives and industries \u2014 finance in particular. The list echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for a number of major economic positions, including Treasury secretary (the former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager Steven T. Mnuchin) and commerce secretary (the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross).Given his long experience as a New York real estate investor, Mr. Trump\u2019s selections may not come as a surprise.\u201cDonald comes from the financial services world. I think he tends to pick people who he\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who is leading the forum effort, told CNBC Friday afternoon.It is a bipartisan list, nonetheless, with a number of members who traditionally have favored Democratic candidates, including Laurence D. Fink of the asset management colossus BlackRock, Mary T. Barra of General Motors and Robert Iger of Walt Disney.\u201cThis forum brings together C.E.O.s and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cMy administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise.\u201dThe group is expected to meet with Mr. Trump monthly. The first meeting will be at the White House in early February. Mr. Schwarzman will serve as chairman.Mr. Schwarzman was not a vocal supporter or fund-raiser for Mr. Trump. Since the election, however, he has embraced the notion that the president-elect\u2019s promise to pull back financial regulations and cut taxes will supercharge the economy.In public and in private, Mr. Schwarzman has lately said that he is \u201cexcited\u201d about the potential for economic growth in a Trump administration.\u201cThere are going to be so many of these changes that I think what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s really going to force growth from a policy perspective,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said at the conference.Despite his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Schwarzman has signaled privately that he would not commit to a full-time position in the administration, but was otherwise interested in helping to advise the president-elect.Other Wall Street heavyweights on the list are Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Adebayo Ogunlesi, a former Credit Suisse executive who is the chairman of the investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. Mr. Ogunlesi is also a board member at Goldman Sachs. No Goldman executives were named to the forum.Forum members with ties to the finance industry include Paul S. Atkins, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now the chief executive of a finance regulation consulting firm, and Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley executive and a former governor of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Dimon is easier to understand. Though initially a supporter of President Obama, the JPMorgan chief has long been critical of the current administration\u2019s financial regulatory overhaul. While his name had been floated as a potential candidate for Treasury secretary, people close to him have insisted that he had no interest in taking on a full-time commitment outside of his bank.Aside from Virginia M. Rometty of IBM, there is hardly any representation of technology companies, and certainly none from Silicon Valley.Indeed, many Silicon Valley luminaries have opposed Mr. Trump since the presidential campaign. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was an enthusiastic supporter of both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.The rest of the advisory group appears to be a bipartisan mixture of business chiefs drawn from the worlds of finance, media and manufacturing. They include Ms. Barra, Mr. Iger, Doug McMillon of Walmart and W. James McNerney Jr., formerly of Boeing.Mr. Trump\u2019s style and speech are sometimes seen as throwbacks to the Reagan administration, and Mr. Welch was the iconic business leader of that era.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ryan Holiday Sells Stoicism as a Life Hack, Without Apology", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byIn an underground gymnasium in New York City in October, the author Ryan Holiday spoke to nearly 350 people about the transformative power of pessimism and self-doubt.During his talk, Mr. Holiday was self-deprecating \u2014 \u201cI will start with the question many of you are probably asking, which is, \u2018Who the hell is this guy?\u2019\u201d \u2014 and casually profane, drawing a few titters from the crowd when he urged them to question their sense of self-importance. \u201cYou might think that you\u2019re hot,\u201d he said, adding a noun that is better left unprinted. \u201cThe reality, and the Stoics say it over and over, is that\u2019s not the case.\u201dWhen an audience member asked Mr. Holiday if Stoicism \u201cis becoming too trendy,\u201d he answered by defending his part in popularizing it as a self-help strategy.\u201cWe\u2019ve only captured a very small fraction of the potential market,\u201d he said, sounding more entrepreneurial than philosophic. \u201cStoicism is a philosophy designed for the masses, and if it has to be simplified a bit to reach the masses, so be it.\u201dNow, he is harnessing his considerable marketing prowess to sell Stoicism. He is like a snake-oil salesman who swears he has abandoned snake oil, but not the highly effective sales tactics.\u201cIf you\u2019re shameless enough, you can sell anything,\u201d he said of his marketing abilities.But Mr. Holiday maintains that his being a good salesman doesn\u2019t clash with his identity as a Stoic.A California native, he lives on a 40-acre ranch with his wife and newborn son in Bastrop County, Tex. Their modest two-story house has a walk-in gun closet, where Mr. Holiday stows a .22 hunting rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a bow and arrow. He keeps a .243 next to the bed, to chase off coyotes and foxes. He shot a jack rabbit from his front porch, and skinned and ate it, and has taken up hog hunting. They have a small herd of 10 cattle, three goats, two donkeys, and chickens, ducks, geese and a guinea hen. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that much about raising cows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re learning.\u201dMr. Holiday discovered Stoicism by reading Marcus Aurelius\u2019s \u201cMeditations\u201d when he was a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of California, Riverside. He read it four times in a row and taped passages to his dorm room wall, over his bed. \u201cThe essential idea of Stoicism in my interpretation is, you don\u2019t control the world around you, you control how you respond,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 19, that\u2019s very empowering.\u201dThat summer, Mr. Holiday got an internship at a Hollywood talent agency, the Collective. They offered him a job, with a starting salary of $30,000, and he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles. \u201cI was the kid who was going places,\u201d he said.A year later, he went to work for American Apparel, where he handled public relations as the company faced sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Charney. He grew disillusioned with his work as a hype man and decided to write a self-indicting expos\u00e9.\u201cI was disgusted with how it all worked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of the book was, I\u2019m going to put all these things in a giant pile and light them on fire.\u201dSome of Mr. Holiday\u2019s controversial clients heaped praise on the book. (\u201cBehind my reputation as marketing genius there is Ryan Holiday,\u201d Mr. Charney gushed in a blurb.) Mr. Holiday seemed to revel in his role as the villain. On the cover, a comic-book-style rendering of Mr. Holiday glares down condescendingly, a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth.Two years later, he published \u201cThe Obstacle Is the Way,\u201d and was embraced as a cleareyed sage offering ancient solutions for first-world problems like status anxiety and work addiction. Mr. Holiday, a professed media con man, started selling a repackaged 2,300-year-old philosophy.After \u201cObstacle\u201d became an unexpected hit, Mr. Holiday delivered more books, including \u201cEgo Is the Enemy,\u201d about the treacherous nature of ego, and \u201cThe Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance and the Art of Living,\u201d a compilation of inspirational quotations from famous Stoics.It\u2019s hard to fathom that the same person who wrote \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m Lying,\u201d a bombastic treatise on the art of self-promotion through media manipulation, went on to write a meditation on the perils of self-absorption and pride. But Mr. Holiday doesn\u2019t have any trouble reconciling the Jekyll and Hyde-like phases of his career. Marketing is what he does, he said; Stoicism is who he is.In the past few months, he has given talks to the Texas Rangers baseball team, a Seattle accounting firm, a telecommunications company in Austin and at HSBC Bank in London and Google\u2019s offices in London, New York and Mountain View, Calif. The military has invited him to speak to elite fighters with the United States Special Operations Command.Mr. Holiday\u2019s message about the need for resilience and humility has caught on with N.F.L. players and coaches, including those of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, which both invited Mr. Holiday to visit their teams\u2019 headquarters.Mr. Holiday\u2019s efforts to rebrand Stoicism as a self-help system for overachievers doesn\u2019t sit well with some philosophers and academics. At Stoicon, a few attendees were irked by Mr. Holiday\u2019s prominent role at the convention (Stoics are philosophically opposed to complaining, so their objections were mild).During a question-and-answer session, one audience member faulted Mr. Holiday for holding up flawed historical figures like John D. Rockefeller, a rapacious capitalist, as a model of Stoicism. Another questioned whether Mr. Holiday\u2019s pursuit of success as a marketer and author was consistent with the Stoic emphasis on detachment from material gain.Mr. Holiday admits that it can be hard at times to reconcile his stature with Stoic principles, particularly now that he\u2019s a sought-after motivational speaker with a growing following among sports stars and celebrities.\u201cIt has the effect of making you think you\u2019re more important than you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good recipe for being full of it.\u201dLiving in rural Texas, with his cows, goats and donkeys, helps keep his ego in check, he said. \u201cMy neighbors don\u2019t care that I\u2019m an author,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently ego-inhibiting.\u201dRanch life is a pretty good training ground for a Stoic, it turns out. Nature is unpredictable. His donkey Buddy was attacked by a mountain lion, and his chickens have been disappearing at night. He suspected coyotes at first, but a more likely culprit emerged as Mr. Holiday gave a walking tour of his ranch one swampy afternoon. A neighbor\u2019s dog followed him home from the cow pasture and snapped up one of his chickens, running in ecstatic circles and shaking the bird.Mr. Holiday yelled and lunged at the dog, which dropped the chicken and ran off. The chicken puffed up her feathers and strutted away. Both the chicken and Mr. Holiday seemed unruffled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Potential Hitch in Zuckerberg\u2019s Stock Plan for Facebook", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorMark Zuckerberg wants to give away nearly all his stake in Facebook, and yet still keep control of the company he helped found. What\u2019s a tech billionaire to do?The neat solution to this problem \u2014 creating a new class of shares \u2014 is par for the course for Silicon Valley, but often gives other shareholders short shrift.With the birth of his daughter last year, Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to transfer 99 percent of his wealth to a company he controls with his wife, which would later donate that money to charity. In giving away his shares, however, he would have to confront the issue of giving up his voting control over Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg currently owns about 15 percent of Facebook, but because most of his stock is Class B shares with 10 votes apiece, he has voting control of the company with 53.8 percent of the votes, a number brought up to about 60 percent of the votes since he also has the ability to vote the shares held by Dustin Moskovitz.If Mr. Zuckerberg fulfilled even part of his giving pledge, which included the donation of $1 billion a year over the next three years, it would mean coming close to losing his control of the company he founded.So he turned to a tried and true strategy: Follow Google.Shareholders hated it and only 12.7 percent of the regular shareholders voted for it, but Mr. Page and Mr. Brin used their control to push it through.The gain for other shareholders is not immediately obvious. The best you could say is that it continues bonding the two founders to Google\u2019s success.At Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg proposed the same structure to his board.Given the clear conflict, a special committee of independent directors was formed, made up of Marc Andreessen, Erskine Bowles and Susan Desmond-Hellmann. These directors were technically independent of Mr. Zuckerberg, though Mr. Andreessen had done business with Facebook. Each was dependent on Mr. Zuckerberg to elect them to the board each year. The committee hired their own law firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, and the investment bank Evercore.This independent committee approved the new stock structure. Under the plan, both Class A and Class B shareholders will receive a dividend of two nonvoting Class C shares, which have equivalent economic value to the Class A and Class B.At face value it appears that everyone is being treated equally, but the deal really benefits Mr. Zuckerberg. With a dividend of over 900 million Class C shares, he can now sell his Class C shares and not reduce his voting control. The net effect of the transaction is that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Class B shares will account for only 5 percent of Facebook\u2019s equity but will have voting control over Facebook. It ensures that Mr. Zuckerberg will have lifetime control over Facebook.It\u2019s a nice deal for Mr. Zuckerberg, but there are potential risks for shareholders. One need only look at Viacom, where the share voting power is held by Sumner Redstone, who is 93 and apparently in poor health. Mr. Zuckerberg may be a genius and capable of operating Facebook now. But he could live to his 90s, and like Mr. Redstone no longer be as capable, instead preferring to assert control simply because he can.And, sure, Facebook pumps out cash like a fire hose, but some check on management would be prudent to avoid the temptation to waste that money on foolhardy projects. (Google Glass, anyone?)This time around, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may have hit pay dirt.As part of discovery in the case, the lawyers have obtained text messages between Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Zuckerberg that appear to show that Mr. Andreessen was leaking information and helping the chief executive while the independent committee was considering this transaction. The text messages were disclosed in a filing made public a few weeks ago.As the special committee was deliberating, Mr. Andreessen \u2014 who was supposed to be representing Facebook shareholders \u2014 appeared to be coaching Mr. Zuckerberg in how to deal with the special committee.According to the filing, Mr. Andreessen texted Mr. Zuckerberg ahead of a meeting to speak beforehand. Lawyers for the shareholders contend that this was to give Mr. Zuckerberg \u201cinside information,\u201d including coaching him on the question of how long he could leave to do government service and still maintain control. And during meetings with the board, Mr. Andreesen sent messages like, \u201cThis line of argument is not helping,\u201d ending with a smiley face, and \u201cNOW WE\u2019RE COOKING WITH GAS.\u201dThese are pretty bad text messages, though Facebook\u2019s lawyers will most likely have an explanation along the lines that this is just the way bargaining works in Silicon Valley.A representative of Facebook declined to comment but referred me to a statement given to Bloomberg that said, \u201cFacebook is confident that the special committee engaged in a thorough and fair process to negotiate a proposal in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders.\u201dThere are a few lessons here even for internet titans.First, do we really have to say in 2016 that you should assume anything you text or email is public? Really?Second, the committee, if we put aside Mr. Andreessen for a moment, seems to have been doing their job in at least thinking about the big issues, particularly Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s government service. And in exchange for putting this new plan into effect, Mr. Zuckerberg did give up something gigantic: He no longer can pass along control to his heirs or simply retire and keep his high vote stock. Now he will have to work at the company to keep control, an important get for the independent committee.The real question here is what Mr. Andreessen was thinking. The committee would probably have come to the same conclusion no matter what, given Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s importance to and control of the company, but at least there was some back and forth.One might guess that Mr. Andreessen was trying to curry favor with Mr. Zuckerberg. His venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, did help sell both Instagram and Oculus investments to Facebook, after all.But given Mr. Andreessen\u2019s great prominence as a venture capitalist, there really was no need to pander like that. And indeed, the more likely explanation is that he thought it was no big deal.Andreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Such an attitude is all too common in Silicon Valley when it comes to corporate governance and lawyers.The text messages that have emerged in this litigation may not change the ultimate outcome. The stock plan is something that Mr. Zuckerberg wants, and Facebook will do what it can to make it happen, even if it includes writing a big check to settle with the shareholders.In addition, the record will most likely show real bargaining by the committee and a real change in governance given Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s giving up control if he doesn\u2019t work.And the company can just reconvene the independent committee and try again \u2014 or even just move out of Delaware, where Facebook is incorporated, to a friendlier state.If Facebook were going public today with such a share-class structure, few investors would bat an eye. Let\u2019s see what happens when Snap goes public. No doubt there will be a very firm structure that ensures Evan Spiegel, 26, maintains control for the rest of his life.That\u2019s too bad. I suppose the foolish view would be that if Mr. Zuckerberg was really good for the long term then he shouldn\u2019t care about share voting control. No one would try to oust him if he were doing a good job. But that is na\u00efve, no doubt.Instead, the message of Facebook is that in Silicon Valley, founders will keep control of their companies no matter what. Also, don\u2019t email or text.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

{"Headline": "In Major Step for Drone Delivery, Amazon Flies Package to Customer in England", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThree years later, his claims no longer look so outlandish.The flight \u2014 to deliver an Amazon Fire streaming device and popcorn to a customer identified only as Richard B. \u2014 took off from a nearby Amazon warehouse and lasted 13 minutes, covering about two miles.Amazon said it would now test drone deliveries with two more customers near Cambridge, an English city where the company has a large drone-testing plant. If the tests are successful, the company says it wants to expand the number of consumers who could participate in the trial to dozens in the coming months, eventually allowing hundreds to use the drone service.The start of customer trials for the drone delivery service, which Amazon calls Prime Air, is a milestone for a technology that could eventually automate an important part of Amazon\u2019s business as the company looks to cement its position as the world\u2019s dominant online retailer.There are reasons to be skeptical about how broadly drones can be used, however, because of aviation rules, weather restrictions and weight limitations on cargo.Experts say that the advent of widespread drone deliveries, even if technically possible, would take years, and regulators from the United States and elsewhere could block the plans.Even if drones end up handling only a small portion of Amazon\u2019s overall deliveries, the implications could be far-reaching.The company, for instance, might not need as many truck drivers or other costly logistical operations. Drones could also have environmental benefits, by reducing reliance on pollution-belching vehicles. The biggest boon may be to customers, who could be able to receive their orders more quickly, depending where they live.The fact that Amazon\u2019s latest drone tests were in Britain is no coincidence.Not all of the residents in the area have been fans, however.Julia Napier, who helped found a Cambridgeshire association that maintains public footpaths around one of Amazon\u2019s test sites, said the company\u2019s drones threatened wildlife and the wider countryside, something that the company has denied.\u201cThey are testing those drones here because they can\u2019t do it in America,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the Americans don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want it, either.\u201dSo far, the devices are limited to carrying cargo weighing less than five pounds. They use cameras to identify landing marker pads that customers place in their backyards or in other unobstructed locations.Amazon is not the first company to test drone delivery.Amazon, however, with its deep pockets, logistical expertise and technological prowess, still seems the most likely to push widespread drone delivery into the mainstream, at least in the Western world.Advertisement"}

(Officials said there have been no known serious illnesses linked to the odor.)\u201cIt\u2019s more than a smell,\u201d said Ellery A. Deaton, a City Council member in Seal Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s noxious. When it happens I need to run around and close my windows.\u201dThe odor is commonly described as \u201cgas-like,\u201d but its origin remains a stubborn mystery.Over the years, City Council, fire department and air quality officials have tried unsuccessfully to get to the bottom of it.As a result, a number of theories have flourished.Gina Clayton-Tarvin, a schools official who lives in Huntington Beach, said she believes it\u2019s natural gas.Ms. Clayton-Tarvin talked about the area\u2019s layout of gas lines, the trajectory of the smell\u2019s spread and her sense in the odor of a hint of mercaptan \u2014 a natural gas additive.\"The smell that I smell,\u201d she said, \u201cis the natural gas smell.\u201dOther residents wonder about offshore oil platforms, or perhaps the shipping vessels arriving into the nearby ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.\u201cMy theory, which is based mainly on the process of elimination, is that it is oil tankers off the coast releasing pressure,\u201d Ms. Deaton said.The ships abide by fairly strict clean air rules. What\u2019s more, Mr. Baker said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a function on a ship that would discharge a foul smell.\u201dFor the moment, the mystery seems bound to linger.Capt. Chris Coates of the Costa Mesa Fire Department said emergency dispatch has been getting calls about the smell for more than a decade.He is as perplexed as anyone, he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the mystique to the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201dThe National Park Service said Thursday that a female mountain lion had been killed trying to cross Highway 118 in Los Angeles.The 5-year-old mountain lion known as P-39 left behind three offspring. Without their mother, they were unlikely to have the hunting skills to survive, wildlife officials said.\u201cIt\u2019s your worst nightmare in that kind of scenario,\u201d said Tanya Diamond, a wildlife ecologist.The collisions have added urgency to efforts in California to create so-called wildlife corridors across highways that allow mountain lions, deer, foxes and other animals to cross safely between habitats in search of sustenance and mating opportunities.In Northern California, another project involves digging two tunnels beneath Highway 17 in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where researchers say hundreds of animals have been hit in the last eight years.\u201cIt\u2019s a great time because I think now a lot of these ideas are coming to fruition,\u201d she said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

There was food. There was gambling, huge amounts of money.\u201dLocke was also a sanctuary. Anti-Chinese violence was widespread in California at the time.In a 1983 interview published in \u201cBitter Melon,\u201d Bing Fai Chow, a longtime delta resident, recalled the hostility: \u201cWe never dared to walk on the streets alone then \u2014 except in Locke. This was our place.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether Locke will survive. Over the decades, the population has dwindled to roughly 90 people. Fewer than 10 are Chinese.But, he added, the town\u2019s history as a den of vice has also created some ambivalence.\u201cIt\u2019s a question falling upon the Chinese community of, what do they want for this town?\u201d he said. \u201cIn a lot of ways Locke symbolizes an amazing success story. But for a lot of others it symbolizes what they don\u2019t want to be remembered for.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Russia Updates Plan to Counter Cyberattacks and Foreign Influence", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin published a new plan on Tuesday to defend Russia against what it described as stepped-up cyberattacks and \u201cinformation-psychological\u201d methods by foreign intelligence agencies bent on influencing its population with online information.The plan, signed by Mr. Putin on Monday but published on Tuesday, described a threat to Russia of technological malfeasance similar to what the United States has accused the Russians of committing. It did not mention, however, any specific online strikes against Russia indicating that American retaliation could be underway.Russia, the document says, is at risk of attacks on systems of \u201cinformation support for democratic institutions\u201d and the spread of harmful, false information.It notes the \u201cincreasing scale of certain countries and organizations using information technologies for military and political goals.\u201dThe 16-page document sketches out what the Kremlin sees as the main threats to its security and national interest from foreign information making its way into the country, and sets priorities for countering them. It identifies terrorist recruiting and financial crime as dangers.Under Mr. Putin, the Kremlin has staked out a role as a defender of conservative values, notably pushing back against gay rights, and the new doctrine is no exception, with a clause raising concern about risks to \u201ctraditional Russian spiritual and moral values\u201d of Russian young people.It also notes the risk to Russia of \u201ca tendency toward an increase of materials containing biased assessments of the state policies of the Russian Federation in foreign media.\u201dThe doctrine supports a plan, in the works for some time, to gain control over the Russian segment of the web by basing more servers inside the country. The plan envisions operating the Russian internet autonomously, if needed in time of war, by switching it off from the rest of the world.And it directs Russian diplomats to pursue the Kremlin\u2019s policy goals on information security at international organizations like the United Nations.Russia has advocated, without much success so far, replacing the nonprofit group that now controls top-level domains with a global agency, the International Telecommunication Union.The document calls attention to \u201cinformation-psychological actions\u201d from abroad undermining Russian \u201cpatriotic traditions of defending the Fatherland.\u201dRussia has already passed laws aimed at regulating internet content and forcing foreign companies to base data servers in Russia. Last month, a Moscow court ordered internet service providers to block LinkedIn, the professional social networking site, for failing to comply.Under a separate law governing news aggregators, sites with daily traffic exceeding 1 million users would bear responsibility as publishers, including a requirement to verify the truthfulness of the articles reposted on their websites. The law would apply to Google, among other aggregators.A spokesman for the regulator, Roskomnadzor, on Tuesday denied a report in the Izvestiya newspaper saying Russian officials had already instructed Google to comply.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Vision of Lingerie: Men Not Required", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byWhen Heidi Zak was getting dressed for work one foggy March morning in 2012, she peered into the drawer that housed her undergarments and sighed sadly. \u201cI pulled out my bras and realized they were so stretched out, and then the dread set in,\u201d Ms. Zak said. \u201cIt\u2019s the dread of having to go out and buy new bras.\u201dAt the time, Ms. Zak was a product marketing manager at Google in San Francisco, but she had always toyed with the idea of building a brand. That morning she figured out what it would be.With her new business, Ms. Zak would seek to solve the plight of bra shopping, which often involves fluorescent lighting, three-way mirrors and a mess of straps and hangers. \u201cBras should have been the first item to go online,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do it with friends, women don\u2019t like the in-store experience, and the market is filled with old-school brands run by middle-aged men who think they\u2019re targeting women.\u201d She says the line has had 20 percent growth month over month since its introduction.This vision marks a contrast with Victoria\u2019s Secret, the bubble-gum pink retailer that, according to the research company IBISWorld, encompasses 62 percent of the $9 billion lingerie market in the United States. That means that a majority of women are buying their most intimate apparel next to life-size photos of supermodels, whose come-hither looks and propped-up underpinnings embody a male fantasy. Emerging lingerie brands are determined to change that association and bring the focus back to women.Like ThirdLove, Lively is a bra and underwear label that prides itself on being made for women by women. Its founder, Michelle Cordeiro Grant, a former senior merchant for bras at Victoria\u2019s Secret, introduced Lively in April to bridge the worlds of athletic wear and innerwear. She coined the term \u201cleisur\u00e9e\u201d (a cross, of sorts, between \u201cathleisure\u201d and lingerie) to describe 11 styles of bralettes, push-ups and T-shirt bras offered in a mix of neutrals and bold prints.\u201cI admire Victoria\u2019s Secret as a business, but I stopped relating to the fantasy and the push-ups and the armor, it was too much for me,\u201d Ms. Grant said. \u201cI wanted to create something more authentic for the modern woman, where she doesn\u2019t have to choose between style and comfort. Victoria\u2019s Secret is the mind-set of \u2018How do I feel when a man looks at me?\u2019 versus \u2018How do I look when I\u2019m feeling confident, comfortable and ready to take on the day?\u2019\u201dIn February, before the site went live, Lively ran a referral program offering redeemable points in exchange for email addresses. Within 48 hours, its flash page had 280,000 unique visits. Ms. Grant declined to comment on sales, but said the company had seen month-over-month growth and had received $5.5 million in funding.\u201cThe intimate apparel business has been sluggish in keeping up with consumers,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at NPD Group. \u201cIt\u2019s already a product that\u2019s difficult to fit, so if you can find a way to make it a more appealing shopping experience, it\u2019s a home run every time. We\u2019re seeing these emerging brands reach consumers on an emotional level, and now stores are going to have to play catch up.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to show women as they are and not trying to change them,\u201d Ms. Morris said. \u201cWe want to celebrate our flaws and see the beauty in our differences. It\u2019s so important and empowering for women to celebrate their shape.\u201d\u201cWe are challenging people and offering a wider viewpoint, which can only be a good thing,\u201d Ms. Morris said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$25 Million in Breakthrough Prizes Given in Science and Math", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byThis year\u2019s winners include five molecular biologists who won $3 million each for work in genetics and cell biology, one mathematician, a trio of string theorists who split one $3 million physics prize, and another 1,015 physicists working on the LIGO gravitational wave detector split a special $3 million physics prize. In addition, there were six smaller \u201cNew Horizons\u201d prizes totaling $600,000 for 10 \u201cearly career\u201d researchers, and a pair of high school students won $400,000 apiece for making science videos.The Breakthrough Foundation was founded by Sergey Brin of Google; Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe; Jack Ma of Alibaba and his wife, Cathy Zhang; Yuri Milner, an internet entrepreneur, and his wife, Julia Milner; and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan.It sprang from Mr. Milner\u2019s decision in 2012 to hand out $3 million apiece to nine theoretical physicists, in the belief that physicists are equal to rock stars and deserve to be paid and celebrated like them. Over the years, as more sponsors have joined, the prizes have spread to life sciences and mathematics. The winners each year are chosen by a committee of previous winners.For the last few years, the awards have been given out in an Oscar-style ceremony held at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, with a variety of Hollywood celebrities, who this year include Morgan Freeman, Alicia Keys and Jeremy Irons.There were two physics prizes awarded this year.According to string theory, all the forces and particles of nature are composed of tiny little wriggling strings. In 1995, Dr. Polchinski showed that the theory also contains objects of two dimensions or more, called \u201cbranes,\u201d short for membranes. This led to a whole new branch of cosmology, in which branes could be island universes floating in an extra-dimensional space like leaves in a fish tank, colliding and otherwise interacting with each other through a higher dimension.In a celebrated calculation in 1996, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Vafa used string theory to compute the information content, or entropy, of a black hole. Their result verified a prediction made by Stephen Hawking using more approximate methods that black holes would leak radiation and eventually explode.Some recent work includes a \u201cdecoupling theorem\u201d \u2014 a sort of very abstract generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applied to oscillating waves like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proven by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter of Indiana University shows similar relationships in the superposition of waves.Dr. Elledge has described DNA as being constantly under attack but having the ability \u2014 he calls it a sort of chemical intelligence \u2014 to monitor its own integrity and activate various defense mechanisms.His research interests range far and wide. In 2015, he and his team reported that they had developed a test that, using less than a drop of blood, could reveal nearly every virus a person had ever been exposed to. Other scientists saw vast potential in the test, suggesting it could be used to track patterns of disease across populations and to learn more about how viruses, and the body\u2019s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer.Dr. Noller is a biochemist and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to obtain the first image of the ribosome\u2019s molecular structure. His work also helped show that ribosomes are ribozymes, a type of RNA molecule that can facilitate chemical reactions. In this case, the ribozymes stitch amino acids together to build proteins.The Wnt signaling pathway is found in every branch of the animal kingdom. It is involved in things as diverse as setting off breast cancer in mice and helping orchestrate the body plan of fruit flies. It has become an important part in many aspects of biology because the molecular cascade it sets off affects the growth of the entire ecosystem of the body.But insight into its inner workings may provide a way to combat its progression. Dr. Zoghbi\u2019s findings have helped provide the groundwork to fighting the disease.Dr. Zoghbi also helped uncover the culprit behind another neurodegenerative disease, Rett syndrome. This crippling condition mostly affects young girls and is often fatal. There are fewer than 1,000 cases a year in the United States. Her team searched for the cause behind the malady for 16 years, eventually identifying it as a mutation in the gene MECP2. By identifying the gene, she also found that it plays a part in other neurological disorders, providing a starting point to fighting the diseases.Organelles, proteins and other molecules inside the cell are constantly becoming damaged or worn out, especially as the cell divides. If too much rubbish builds up, it can become toxic and kill the cell. Autophagy is also a tool that the cell uses to refuel itself if it is starving.During autophagy, the cell produces internal garbage bags called autophagosomes that capture waste. The autophagosomes are sealed by a double membrane that keeps in the junk. They then fuse with organelles called lysosomes, which carry enzymes that help dissolve whatever is inside.Researchers think that failures in autophagy could contribute to Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also think it could help us better understand the process of aging.In addition to the big $3 million prizes, there were six $100,000 New Horizons prizes \u2013 half in physics and half in mathematics. The young physics winners are: Asimina Arvanitaki of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, Peter Graham of Stanford and Surjeet Rajendran of the University of California, Berkeley, who split one prize; Simone Giombi of Princeton and Xi Yin of Harvard who split another prize; and Frans Pretorius of Princeton.In mathematics, the New Horizons winners were Mohammed Abouzaid of Columbia University; Hugo Duminil-Copin of the University of Geneva; and Benjamin Elias of the University of Oregon and Geordie Williamson of Kyoto University.Advertisement"}

A white $129 speaker slightly larger than a can of beans, Google Home can spit out the status of the S&P 500, create a shopping list and control your lights, television and thermostat through smart-home automation devices like Nest and Philips Hue.

Google Home can respond to questions such as \u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest Mexican restaurant?\u201d It can tell you what $300 is in euros, and that the Burj Khalifa is about 2,717 feet tall. It can tell you about your coming trip by searching your digital calendar, and give you local traffic and weather conditions. It can book a ride if you say \u201cCall an Uber,\u201d or display photos from your honeymoon in Bali on your Chromecast-connected television screen.To use Google Home, just say, \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d The LED light ring atop will illuminate, a sign that it\u2019s listening.

However, it didn\u2019t give an arrival time. It simply said: \u201cUnited Airlines 97 from San Francisco to Houston is on time and departs in five hours and 26 minutes.\u201d I asked again. It failed again to give an arrival time.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Desk Wants to Know\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byLooking BackTimes journalists are fearless when they hear statements like \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going to sue you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed in here\u201d or \u201cThe mayor denounced your story at his press conference.\u201dWhat will make them quail are the words: \u201cThe desk wants to know \u2014\u201dThat means a copy editor has found something bewildering, confusing or flat-out wrong in your story. And the copy is going nowhere until the matter is resolved.\u201cSome big wheels in Washington are going to have smaller wheels from now on.\u201dMs. Shanahan filed her copy. It was transmitted to New York. Then the call came. The desk wanted to know. Do sedans actually have smaller wheels than limousines?\u201cSome big wheels in Washington are going to have shorter wheelbases from now on.\u201dEileen shared this tale with me years later to illustrate how finicky copy editors could be. But it illustrates something else. The Times didn\u2019t want to get it wrong, even something that seemed so inconsequential.Copy desks are our bulwark. They are integral to our news gathering.Though their work is, at its best, invisible, the imprint of copy desks on newsroom culture is enormous.Desk chiefs are still called slots, recalling the days when they functioned as slots through which raw stories were sent to copy readers and edited stories were dispatched to the composing room. The slots sat inside a semicircular array of desks known then, and now, as the rim. Copy is still spiked, though it\u2019s been a long time since paper was impaled on metal. And we still cut and paste, without the scissors or glue pots.Copy desks have been the talk of the Times newsroom in recent days, after the most fundamental realignment in memory. As of Dec. 5, the metro, foreign-national, business and sports copy desks ceased to exist. Their work was taken over by four new groups, called the live, projects, enterprise and weeklies desks.\u201cOur copy desks have always reflected the organizing principles of the newsroom as a whole, so that Metro as a coverage area, for example, meant we had a metro copy desk,\u201d Susan Wessling, the senior editor in charge of newsroom planning, wrote to the newsroom last summer. \u201cBut less and less of what we need to do is based strictly on geography or topic area. With our accelerated coverage of everything, in every form, we need desks that can operate with appropriate pace and metabolism for different types of journalism, not just different subject areas.\u201dCharles Knittle, formerly the slot on the foreign-national copy desk (a merger he superintended), is now co-chief of the live desk, with Peter Blair. \u201cIn addition to looking out for accuracy, and style and fairness,\u201d Mr. Knittle said, \u201cthe copy desks have added another function, which is to try to foster a basic process literacy across all the new specialties \u2014 video, interactive design, social media, mobile and other subdivisions of digital production \u2014 in the hope that some of what Times copy editors do can take hold in these new forms.\u201dThis transitional moment offers a chance to reflect gratefully on the role of copy editors in shaping the overall report, and in polishing words that appear under others\u2019 bylines.I remember struggling to find a verb that would convey how a group of Jewish refugees in World War II had \u2014 somethinged \u2014 restrictive government quotas to enter the United States. Not sidestepped. Not ignored. Not defied.\u201cCopy editors are, finally, the people with the knowledge and the reach to span the entire arc of a story from the reporter on the ground to the staff editor moving the parts on the home page,\u201d Mr. Knittle said. \u201cYou must know the story of the blind men and the elephant, and how each man touched a different part of the beast and exclaimed, \u2018It\u2019s a tree!\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s a fan!\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s a hose!\u2019 The copy desk is still looking at the whole animal \u2014 making sure each story is accurate, literate and attractive \u2014 while so many others are busy feeling the elephant.\u201dReaders are naturally aware of mistakes that slip through. And it\u2019s not uncommon to hear Times loyalists complain that errors have grown distressingly common, as editors perform ever more demanding jobs on ever diminishing timetables.What\u2019s impossible to discern, however, is how many outright errors and unfortunate nuances never see print.\u201cI just thanked a copy editor, for example, for observing that a story about the effect of climate change on fall foliage in Canada had used only American sources,\u201d Mr. Knittle said. \u201cThe piece was sent back to the writer for a little more reporting, and presumably a better story for The Times\u2019s current push into the north.\u201dMs. Wessling recalled a Page 1 story about a man whose name was misspelled throughout until a copy editor, Jaime Swanson, checked it. She also said that the lighthearted lede of an article about a new use for technology was changed after a copy editor objected that the phrasing insulted an entire class of people.In a compilation of catches made by the sports copy desk, John Oudens saluted his colleague Jason Bailey for spotting four errors in a single month while reviewing print page proofs between deadlines: Miomir Kecmnovic (it is Kecmanovic), Maya Dirado (it is DiRado), Kody Puderbaugh (it is Kory) and Jonathan Hankins (it is Johnathan).\u201cOne of the biggest challenges of being a copy editor is editing the copy of the most accurate writers,\u201d said Steve Bell, a veteran of the metro rim who now works with both metro and society news. \u201cEveryone will get something wrong sometime, and it\u2019s just as important, maybe more so, to catch the error of a writer who makes one mistake every two years as that of the reporter who is a mere mortal like the rest of us.\u201dA memorable catch came on Ms. Wade\u2019s watch. \u201cTed Shabad, late and great, shows us the core of the job,\u201d she wrote.\u201cOn the night of Aug. 2, 1964, I was in the foreign-desk slot and he was on the rim. At the last gasp, a long-awaited WX [Washington] dispatch: Conflict in the South China Sea. I dealt the dispatch to Ted, who sped to the Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer, of which he had been an editor. Returning, Ted said: \u2018The fixes they give are about 30 miles inland.\u2019\u201cThis is, on a global scale, an illustration of what an ex-desk head considers the everyday task of anonymous copy editors.\u201dJust in case the desk wanted to know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rail Crossing Warnings Are Sought for Mapping Apps", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Following directions from Google Maps on a smartphone last year, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez turned a Ford truck, hauling a trailer, where he thought the app was telling him to go. But he ended up stuck on the railroad tracks at a poorly marked California crossing.Soon after Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez abandoned the truck, a commuter train barreled into it, killing the engineer and injuring 32 others.On Monday, after investigating the crash for almost two years, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a safety recommendation asking technology and delivery companies to add the exact locations of more than 200,000 grade crossings into digital maps and to provide alerts when drivers encounter them.The crash involving Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez\u2019s truck \u2014 on Feb. 24, 2015, in Oxnard, Calif. \u2014 was one of the more than 200 fatalities that took place at a grade crossing, where road and railway lines are at the same level, in the United States last year. What made this crash stand out was the possible role of digital mapping technology in taking a driver down a wrong path. This was the first time the safety board has targeted navigation apps as a factor in a major accident.\u201cThe safer car in the future isn\u2019t going to have a better bumper; it\u2019s going to have better navigation,\u201d said Eric Gundersen, chief executive of Mapbox, a digital map provider.The Federal Railroad Administration has lobbied technology companies for 18 months to add alerts for grade crossings. The rail agency said it had contacted 11 technology companies, including Apple and Microsoft, to integrate its location data of grade crossings.In this year\u2019s lineup of GPS devices, Garmin included safety warnings for potential hazards like sharp turns and railroad crossings, the company said, although it does not use the federal rail location data.Several months after the Oxnard crash, the railroad agency said Google had agreed to add audio and visual warnings to Google Maps, the world\u2019s most popular mapping app, based on grade-crossing location data. But Google has not yet included that feature, even though it has updated the app more than two dozen times for the iPhone since then.The National Transportation Safety Board said Apple and three other companies had also agreed to add crossing data, but the board was uncertain when the companies would do so.A spokeswoman from Google said the company was aware of the safety board\u2019s recommendation and was looking at ways to add safety features. Apple said it was working to add the rail data to its maps but would not elaborate on implementation specifics. Microsoft and MapQuest said they were also reviewing the data used in their maps.In a speech on Sept. 15, Sarah E. Feinberg, administrator of the railroad agency, said many of the recent deaths at rail crossings were not from drivers trying to \u201cbeat the train\u201d but were \u201csituations where the driver lost situational awareness, or there weren\u2019t sufficient protections in place to protect the vehicle or provide adequate warning to the driver.\u201dShe chided technology companies for procrastinating on integrating data into mapping applications that \u201cwill save many lives.\u201dOn Monday, Ms. Feinberg praised the safety board\u2019s recommendation, saying she hoped it \u201cwill raise this to the top of technology companies\u2019 priority lists.\u201dThe N.T.S.B.\u2019s recommendations are not binding, but the board can use them to pressure technology companies to take action. It can also try to persuade Congress to offer funds to provide incentives to the companies, said James E. Hall, a former chairman of the safety board.The board has issued map-related safety recommendations in the past, urging utility companies to update their maps with accurate locations of abandoned gas lines.Digital maps started replacing paper maps about a decade ago, when stand-alone GPS devices from companies like Garmin and TomTom became more affordable and car companies started offering built-in navigation systems. But the breakthrough came when Google and Apple added turn-by-turn directions into mapping apps on smartphones, putting the technology into millions of devices already in people\u2019s pockets.Globally, an estimated one billion people use a mapping app or service every week, according to the technology research firm Berg Insight.In the Oxnard crash, the driver was using Google Maps in Spanish on a smartphone borrowed from his wife. Investigators believe the map was one of a number of factors, including driver fatigue.Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez was on a 350-mile drive from his home in Yuma, Ariz. What was supposed to be a six-hour trip had stretched to 21 hours because his truck broke down along the way and he was involved in a minor crash. He came upon the rail crossing before sunrise, having not slept substantively in more than 24 hours, the safety board\u2019s report said.\u201cThe N.T.S.B. concludes that had the driver\u2019s navigation application included information on the upcoming grade crossing, he would have been less likely to misinterpret the visual cues and mistakenly turn onto the railroad tracks,\u201d the safety board wrote in its report.At the time, the crossing had no grade separation, and there were no cones or markers warning drivers from turning onto the rails. Since 2008, there have been five accidents at that crossing, including one in 2010 when a confused driver turned onto the tracks and was struck by a train. The driver was injured, but there were no fatalities.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand how in the dark, a sleep-deprived driver unfamiliar with the area can turn at the wrong place if a navigation app says, \u2018Turn here,\u2019\u201d said James McGillis, who lives near Oxnard, in Simi Valley, and has written extensively on his website about the crash.The police found Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez a mile from his truck. He had abandoned it on the tracks with the headlights and hazard lights on and the driver\u2019s door open. Ron Bamieh, Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez\u2019s lawyer, said his client was trying to get help. Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez was charged in February of this year with vehicular manslaughter and is awaiting arraignment.At some grade crossings, there are no gates or blinking lights to warn drivers of an oncoming train \u2014 just a crossing sign or a crossbuck, a white \u201cX\u201d marked with the words \u201crailroad crossing.\u201d Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, said grade crossings could be especially dangerous because drivers often do not take the proper precautions, especially with all the other distractions in the car.\u201cSometimes we want to distract while they are distracted,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said, praising the safety board\u2019s move. \u201cThat level of technology can be a game changer.\u201dThe need for a recommendation speaks to the dependence some drivers feel toward navigation apps, choosing to follow directions from the app even in the face of contradictory information.In February, after a rockslide closed Interstate 70 in Colorado, directions from Google Maps sent drivers over a mountain pass near Aspen as an alternative. But that road was closed for the winter.A spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Amy Ford, said many drivers ignored road signs informing them that the road was closed and followed the apps instead. The most determined drivers became stranded and needed assistance from law enforcement.\u201cIt\u2019s become integral for many drivers,\u201d said Jake Nelson, AAA\u2019s director of traffic safety advocacy and research. \u201cThe risk is when we become over-reliant on these technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But to bring it off the show took it very seriously, persuading the composer Nico Muhly to take a break from working on his second opera for the Metropolitan Opera to write the music and engaging the soprano Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez to record it during her recent run at the San Francisco Opera. In its offbeat way, the show revived the long-dormant practice of commissioning new opera for TV.The aria will be a fleeting \u2014 but important \u2014 moment in the new season of \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d which combines screwball comedy and magical realism to tell the story of a fictional New York orchestra. With the musicians locked out in a labor dispute, the season begins with their music director, played by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, in Venice working on the comeback concert of a Maria Callas-like diva portrayed by Monica Bellucci.Amy Fisher\u2019s aria follows a tradition of true-crime opera: Leoncavallo said his blood-soaked verismo masterpiece \u201cPagliacci\u201d was inspired by a real incident, and Mr. Muhly\u2019s recent opera \u201cTwo Boys\u201d was based on a murder in England. But \u201cMozart\u201d did not set out to use the story of Amy Fisher, who was a Long Island high school student when she had an affair with an auto body repairman, Joey Buttafuoco, and shot and wounded his wife, Mary Jo.They got to work, debating in texts and emails whether a part of Mr. Morris\u2019s libretto should rhyme. (They agreed it should, inspired by the words leading up to \u201cDido\u2019s Lament\u201d in Purcell\u2019s \u201cDido and Aeneas.\u201d) Then Mr. Muhly set it to music, conjuring a sound world of looped voices, electronic instruments and repetitive counting to try to imagine Ms. Fisher just before the shooting.\u201cIt feels like something that\u2019s specifically operatic \u2014 that you can access that combination of emotion, motivation, motility, all those things at once, in a way that only opera can,\u201d Mr. Muhly said. \u201cThe thing I tried very hard to do was not turn it into a kind of funny, ha-ha, let\u2019s-laugh-at-her thing.\u201dSitting beside the Grand Canal during a break in the shooting last summer in Venice, Ms. Bellucci said she had worked with an opera coach and studied videos of Maria Callas, Anna Netrebko and Beverly Sills to prepare for her lip-syncing scenes. \u201cIt was so interesting to see how they move onstage, and also how everything is so fragile \u2014 because they have an instrument inside themselves.\u201dSo will the rest of the Long Island Lolita opera ever be written?

{"Headline": "Trump Speaks With Taiwan\u2019s Leader, an Affront to China", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with Taiwan\u2019s president on Friday, a striking break with nearly four decades of diplomatic practice that could precipitate a major rift with China even before Mr. Trump takes office.Mr. Trump\u2019s office said he had spoken with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, \u201cwho offered her congratulations.\u201d He is believed to be the first president or president-elect who has spoken to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979, when the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People\u2019s Republic of China.In the statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s office said the two leaders had noted \u201cthe close economic, political, and security ties\u201d between Taiwan and the United States. Mr. Trump, it said, \u201calso congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.\u201dOn Saturday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in his government\u2019s first official reaction, played down the call.Stressing the good relationship between the United States and China, he said, \u201cI also believe this will not change the One China policy upheld by the American government for many years.\u201dMr. Wang, speaking to reporters in Beijing, characterized the call as initiated by the Taiwanese government. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a petty action by the Taiwan side.\u201dThe White House was not told about Mr. Trump\u2019s call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter.The longer-term fallout from the Trump-Tsai conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a well-established arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing.Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has adamantly opposed the attempts of any country to carry on official relations with it.Initial reaction from China about Friday\u2019s telephone call was surprise verging on disbelief. \u201cThis is a big event, the first challenge the president-elect has made to China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThis must be bad news for the Chinese leadership.\u201dOfficial state-run media have portrayed Mr. Trump in a positive light, casting him as a businessman China could get along with. He was favored among Chinese commentators during the election over Hillary Clinton, who was perceived as being too hard on China.Mr. Trump\u2019s exchange touched \u201cthe most sensitive spot\u201d for China\u2019s foreign policy, Mr. Shi said. The government, he said, would most likely interpret it as encouraging Ms. Tsai, the leader of the party that favors independence from the mainland, to continue to resist pressure from Beijing.Among diplomats in the United States, there was similar shock. \u201cThis is a change of historic proportions,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior director of Asian affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cThe real question is, what are the Chinese going to do?\u201dTies between the United States and Taiwan are currently managed through quasi-official institutions. The American Institute in Taiwan issues visas and provides other basic consular services, and Taiwan has an equivalent institution with offices in several cities in the United States.These arrangements are the outgrowth of the One China policy that has governed relations between the United States and China since President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s historic meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of China, abrogating its ties with Taipei a year later.The call also raised questions of conflicts of interest.Ms. Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Obama took the action on national security grounds, after an intelligence review concluded that the technology could be used for \u201cmilitary applications\u201d and help provide an \u201coverall technical body of knowledge and experience\u201d to the Chinese.The decision is likely to accelerate tension with Beijing, as Chinese authorities make it extraordinarily difficult for American technology companies, including Google and Facebook, to gain access to the Chinese market, and Washington seeks to slow China\u2019s acquisition of critical technology.By happenstance, just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai, Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who designed the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, was in Beijing meeting with Mr. Xi. It was unclear if Mr. Kissinger, 93, was carrying any message from Mr. Trump, with whom he met again recently in his role as the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy sage.\u201cThe presidential election has taken place in the United States and we are now in the key moment. We, on the Chinese side, are watching the situation very closely. Now it is in the transition period,\u201d Mr. Xi told Mr. Kissinger in front of reporters.A small, hard-line faction of Republicans has periodically urged a more confrontational approach to Beijing, and many of President George W. Bush\u2019s advisers were pressing such an approach in the first months of his presidency in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11 defused that move, and Iraq became the No. 1 enemy. After that, Mr. Bush needed China \u2014 for North Korea diplomacy, counterterrorism and as an economic partner \u2014 and any movement toward confrontation was quashed.This week, Mr. Trump appeared to accept an invitation from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit Pakistan, a country that Mr. Obama has steered clear of, largely over tensions between Washington and Islamabad over counterterrorism policy and nuclear proliferation.Reporting was contributed by Jane Perlez from Beijing, Michael Forsythe from Hong Kong, and Eric Lipton and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington.Advertisement"}

Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions \u2014 steps that it declined to take in September.It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked.Yahoo said it discovered the larger hacking after analyzing data files, provided by law enforcement, that an unnamed third party had claimed contained Yahoo information.Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers.And critics say the company was slow to adopt aggressive security measures, even after a breach of over 450,000 accounts in 2012 and series of spam attacks \u2014 a mass mailing of unwanted messages \u2014 the following year.\u201cWhat\u2019s most troubling is that this occurred so long ago, in August 2013, and no one saw any indication of a breach occurring until law enforcement came forward,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, the chief executive of Synack, a security company. \u201cYahoo has a long way to go to catch up to these threats.\u201dYahoo has made a steady trickle of disclosures about the 2014 hacking, which it has been investigating with the help of federal authorities. The company said Wednesday that it now believes the attacker in that breach, which it says was sponsored by a government, found a way to forge credentials to log into some users\u2019 accounts without a password.Bob Lord, Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, said in a statement that the state-sponsored actor in the 2014 attack had stolen Yahoo\u2019s proprietary source code. Outside forensics experts working with Yahoo believe that the state-sponsored hackers used Yahoo\u2019s code to access user accounts without their passwords by creating forged \u201ccookies,\u201d short bits of text that a website can store on a user\u2019s machine.

{"Headline": "Uber Expands Self-Driving Car Service to San Francisco. D.M.V. Says It\u2019s Illegal.", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byBut California regulators made an even bigger splash late Wednesday when they told Uber to stop the service because it was illegal. The company, the officials said, did not have the necessary state permits for autonomous driving.\u201cIt is illegal for the company to operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads until it receives an autonomous vehicle testing permit,\u201d Brian G. Soublet, deputy director of California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a letter to Uber. \u201cAny action by Uber to continue the operation of vehicles equipped with autonomous technology on public streets in California must cease until Uber complies.\u201dUber did not return a request for comment about the letter.Even before the service began in San Francisco, questions arose over whether Uber was allowed to test its driverless technology in the city. As of Dec. 8, the company\u2019s name was not listed on the D.M.V.\u2019s website as having a permit to test the vehicles in the state. Companies like Google, Tesla and General Motors all hold permits to test autonomous vehicles in California.When asked, Uber said that it was compliant with all federal and state laws. In California, it said, the motor vehicle department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive \u201cwithout the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\u201d Uber said its self-driving cars, which require a person at the wheel to monitor or control them, did not fall under that strict definition.The dispute was a reminder that Uber has not expanded its service without regulatory hassles. As it has grown, it has run into battles with the authorities worldwide, with regulators often contending that Uber had a dearth of licensed drivers, among other issues.Uber began Wednesday with Anthony Levandowski, its vice president of self-driving technology, saying in a blog post that \u201cthe promise of self-driving is core to our mission of reliable transportation, everywhere for everyone.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.For a while on Wednesday, any San Francisco passenger who requested a ride from UberX, one of the service\u2019s cheaper options, might have been picked up by an autonomous vehicle. They would have received a notification in the Uber app, and could accept or cancel and request a regular driver. An engineer behind the wheel in each self-driving vehicle could take over when needed.Three passengers were able to fit into the XC90 vehicles. Riders could use with a large touch screen that displayed the car\u2019s route, as well as a rendered version of the environment the car saw through its cameras and laser guidance systems. Uber also let passengers take selfies from a camera facing the back seat, which they can email to themselves and share on social media.Uber wanted to use the expansion of the program to test routes and terrain beyond what it experienced in Pittsburgh.\u201cWe drove in the rain and other kinds of weather, and we\u2019ve added lane-changing capabilities since we started in September,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said in an interview, adding that Uber has faced no major issues in its testing in Pennsylvania thus far. \u201cNow we want to see how we operate in this new environment, especially with the giant hills that San Francisco has to offer.\u201dUber may have gotten more than it bargained for. Shortly after the service began, one of its Volvo XC90s ran a red light, and was caught on camera. The episode raised questions about the safety of Uber\u2019s self-driving technology.\u201cThis incident was due to human error,\u201d Uber said in a statement about the video, which was posted to YouTube. \u201cThis vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate.\u201dA headline on Thursday with an article about Uber\u2019s testing of a self-driving car service in San Francisco misidentified the government body that told the company in a letter that such a service was illegal because the proper permits were not obtained. As the article correctly noted, it was California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles, not the City of San Francisco. (Despite the letter, Uber has said it will continue its test; the notice did not stop Uber\u2019s plans.)Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Effect Rubs Off on Schools in One Rural Oklahoma Town", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byPRYOR, Okla. \u2014 Students at Pryor High School study robotics. Elementary schools have basic computer programming classes using free laptops, online collaboration software and Wi-Fi spread across this small town in Oklahoma\u2019s Green Country.\u201cWe have to prepare them for their future, not our past,\u201d said Don Raleigh, superintendent of the town\u2019s schools. \u201cYou have to have new skill sets.\u201dAt Wagoner High School, 25 miles south, students in an overcrowded classroom learn about word processing and spreadsheets on old desktop computers. In a recent session, some students napped, while others watched a documentary about high school football.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that we are the have-nots,\u201d said Randy Harris, superintendent of Wagoner schools. Rather than plan for the online future, where all the good jobs will be, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to provide enough textbooks and teachers.\u201dThe difference between these towns is the jackpot that arrived in the form of an enormous Google data center.As increasing focus is being paid to the wealth and jobs created by tech companies outside Silicon Valley, Google\u2019s arrival in small-town Pryor serves as a complex example of what happens when a modern internet company builds one of its data centers in a community.Since 2010, Google has been building a giant computing complex in Pryor, a town of 9,500 people in Mayes County, about 40 miles east of Tulsa. Google\u2019s only larger center is in Council Bluffs, Iowa, another place with cheap land and power and abundant water.While Wagoner\u2019s industrial property tax base, the biggest part of local school funding in Oklahoma, is assessed at $65 million, Pryor\u2019s is assessed at $430 million. Over $300 million of that is ascribed to Google.Almost none of the $18.4 million that Pryor schools got last year actually came from Google, however. A business-friendly law dating from 1985 means the state paid $23.9 million of Google\u2019s local property taxes for 2016, and Google paid just $1.2 million. That was still enough to make it the largest taxpayer in the county.Google gets a similar deal for the first five years of development, then picks up the tab in the sixth year, minus depreciation, or the presumed wear and tear on assets like the servers housed in the complex. Google says it has no idea what it will eventually pay.At the same time, a drop in the price of oil and natural gas, mainstays of Oklahoma tax revenue, have compelled the state to cut funding to many schools. Last year, Wagoner, population 8,600, had a budget of $14 million for its schools, down from $18 million five years ago.On a recent Monday, Mr. Harris shivered under three shirts in a half-lit, half-heated building. State budget cuts had forced Wagoner to a school week of four longer days.Pryor, meantime, has weekend academic competitions, bonuses for teachers, and sparkling new classrooms. Higher taxes enabled Pryor to raise $60 million in bonds. It set aside money for textbooks, technology and buildings.In a sixth-grade class, youngsters do math on their laptops, and are encouraged to \u201cget out of their comfort zones\u201d by looking at online resources like Khan Academy, a tutoring program.What Google does bring, in abundance, is largess. Since 2011, Google has donated $1.5 million in Mayes County, largely for education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM. The Chromebooks, laptops that run on a Google operating system, are part of those donations.The free Wi-Fi is on top of the school donations. There are \u201cGoogle Fests\u201d where students and businesses can learn about coding and e-commerce. The company subsidizes elementary school classes in writing software. Twenty volunteers come into schools to help students with things like building underwater robots.\u201cWe changed things here, with exposure to a world they never knew existed,\u201d said Brenda Standridge, manager of Google\u2019s Pryor facility. \u201cEventually every job is going to be a tech job.\u201dGoogle didn\u2019t used to be this open or generous in towns where it was based, said Andrew Silvestri, Google\u2019s head of public policy for the central United States. Over the years, corporate secrecy created \u201ca lot of rumors, a sense of mystery,\u201d that made for bad blood with local residents, he said.Pryor recently gave accredited teachers a $2,000 bonus, a lot of money in a state where teacher salaries start at $31,600 and top out at $46,000. Other Oklahoma educators have been leaving for better-paying jobs in Texas, Kansas and Arkansas.One sign of the crisis in most public schools in Oklahoma is its annual program that puts uncertified people in a classroom on an emergency basis. In the 2011-12 school year, there were 32 of these emergency teachers. In the first half of this school year, there are 1,082. Voters recently defeated a proposed sales tax increase for higher teaching salaries, one cent per transaction, 59 percent to 41 percent.\u201cThe heavy lifting of government must have engaged communities to sustain the work of educating students,\u201d said Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma\u2019s state schools superintendent. \u201cEach community will have strategies that fit its area.\u201dThat works in Pryor, or Bartlesville, where ConocoPhillips has a headquarters, and a few years ago gave the schools computer and science labs. Skilled workers volunteer there, too.\u201cI don\u2019t know another district that has what we and Pryor do,\u201d said LaDonna Chancellor, principal of Bartlesville High School.Lately some Pryor students have gone on to prestigious institutions like Duke University. Others are at state and vocational schools.That\u2019s not to say all the problems have gone away. Last year, nine parents of children from one of Mr. Raleigh\u2019s second-grade classes faced drug offenses, mostly for use of opioids or methamphetamine. Fifty-two percent of Pryor students get free lunches.Down the road, homes in Wagoner, a charming community by Fort Gibson Lake, now list for about $82,000, compared with $145,000 in Pryor. Businesses include a shopping cart factory, a small hospital and a maker of coatings for truck beds. Children depend on ad sales on school posters for things like their yearbook, music classes, or sports.\u201cThey help out as they can, but mostly it\u2019s $300 a pop,\u201d said Mr. Harris, the superintendent. \u201cIt\u2019s not a $500,000 donation.\u201dIn fact, that is what a wealthy local recently gave Wagoner. It bought an indoor football training facility. On Dec. 2 the Wagoner Bulldogs won their third straight state championship, in a division for smaller schools.An article on Dec. 12 about benefits that Google has brought to Pryor, Okla., by building a data center in the small town erroneously included one college that Pryor students have recently attended. Although several students have gone on to prestigious universities, Brown is not one of them. The article also gave an outdated name for a major company based in Bartlesville, Okla. It is now ConocoPhillips, no longer Phillips 66.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Reaches Settlement Over Songwriting Royalties", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byOn Thursday, YouTube, which is by most estimates the most popular destination for music online, announced that it had reached a settlement with the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, a trade group, over the complex issue of unpaid songwriting royalties.The settlement is estimated to be worth more than $40 million, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private terms. Neither YouTube nor the publishers\u2019 association would comment on the amount.The agreement with YouTube, which is owned by Google, will give participating publishers \u2014 the companies that traditionally manage songwriting rights, which are separate from those of recordings \u2014 access to a list of songs for which YouTube has missing or incomplete rights data.

{"Headline": "Automated Assistants Will Soon Make a Bid for Your Finances", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byMr. Bloch\u2019s company currently creates free automated savings accounts \u2014 and has helped customers put aside over $250 million \u2014 but his vision is to add capabilities until Digit becomes a full-service financial assistant like Jane.\u201cEveryone needs a Jane,\u201d Mr. Bloch said.There is now a lot of competition to create an automated financial assistant for the masses.One feature that both Credit Karma and Mint will offer is more automated tax preparation of the sort that Jane provided for Ender (though with much less robotic charm and thoroughness).The start-ups and the banks are still far from delivering on the promise of a digital assistant that actually takes care of your financial problems for you. Credit Karma and Mint still require you to enter many of your own details. But all the players in the field are working with machine learning and artificial intelligence that will increasingly provide proactive analysis and advice rather than forcing someone to constantly check in.Many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are betting that in the continuing transformation of finance by technology, the financial assistant category will be one of the most lucrative.\u201cThere is lots of opportunity here,\u201d said Charles Birnbaum, an investor at the venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, who recently put money into Albert. \u201cThis is an opportunity that Mint and the banks should have done for people already \u2014 made it really easy to have a good sense for what you should be doing with your money.\u201dThe new personal financial advisers are taking a different tack compared with big-name financial technology start-ups like Lending Club and Square, which provide actual financial services: arranging loans and processing payments. Credit Karma and its competitors are betting that there is more value in being the neutral intermediary that helps customers find financial services and keep track of their various accounts.Advocates of this business model compare the opportunity to the one that Google and Facebook spotted in media, where they serve as so-called platforms for other media companies rather than being media companies themselves. This approach allowed them to become the primary point of contact with the customer, a very profitable and powerful place to sit.\u201cBy being Switzerland, and being neutral, in the same way that Google and Facebook are, we are finding the best products,\u201d said Nikhyl Singhal, a former Google executive who joined Credit Karma as the chief product officer last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the conflict where we are trying to sell our own product.\u201dCredit Karma in particular has been demonstrating how lucrative this can be by charging lenders and credit card companies for every customer it passes along. While the company does not say how much it charges, industry insiders say that Credit Karma generally makes $100 to $700 for every customer who signs up for a credit card, a significant chunk of the revenue that the credit card company will make in the first year. Credit Karma said it pulled in around $350 million of revenue last year.The business model creates the potential for conflicts of interest if an intermediary like Credit Karma sends customers to a credit card company or lender that pays the biggest referral fee rather than the one that offers the best deal for the customer. But the companies are all adamant that they will succeed only if they are known for doing what is best for the customer.Credit Karma now has 60 million account holders, 20 million of whom check in every month \u2014 about 10 times as many as its biggest rival, Mint, and nearly as many as some of the nation\u2019s largest banks.Founded in San Francisco in 2007, Credit Karma has been known for the niche service of providing customers with free access to credit scores, and advice on how to improve them.Recently, though, the company has been using its large pile of cash from venture capitalists to buy and build new features for customers, including one function that searches for unclaimed property for all of its customers and another that can identify and dispute credit report errors through the site.This week, the company is announcing its acquisition of a tax software company, OnePriceTaxes, that has been integrated into Credit Karma to allow free state and federal tax filings for every customer on the site.Ken Lin, the founder and chief executive of the site, said that once Credit Karma had access to a customer\u2019s tax filings it would have a much more detailed picture of that person\u2019s finances and could turn that into new layers of financial advice \u2014 by identifying, for instance, ways to invest money with more tax efficiency.For many, the best-known financial website is still Mint, which gained renown by allowing customers to track all their varied financial accounts in one place. It too makes money by pointing customers to outside financial products that pay Mint for each referral.But Mr. Lin and others in the industry said that Mint, which is now owned by Intuit, struggled to maintain its early growth because it required too much work from its customers, who have to categorize their transactions and do not get much in return.Al Ko, who became Mint\u2019s general manager last year, acknowledges that most Americans are not willing to do the work to keep track of their finances in Mint. As a result, he has led a rebuilding of Mint so that it will do more of the work for customers, and make active recommendations rather than just serve as a place to keep track of a budget.The first big step in Mint\u2019s expansion is the announcement this week of a dashboard that will monitor bills and remind customers when they are coming due, with increasingly urgent notifications as the date nears. Mint is also making it possible for customers to make payments directly through it, rather than a credit card site.Mr. Ko said that 6 percent of Mint customers failed to make even the minimum payment on their credit cards each month, a lapse that can lead to big fees and damaged credit scores.Mint and another Intuit division, TurboTax, are also being integrated so that tax forms from banks and credit cards will be automatically fed into customers\u2019 tax filings.\u201cI envision Mint being as ubiquitous as Facebook,\u201d Mr. Ko said. \u201cThis thing that helps me make better decisions and never forgets.\u201dDigit, the company inspired by Jane, has been rapidly picking up customers, and venture capital money. Now it needs to begin adding features to come closer to the original vision out of science fiction.\u201cEnder was a guy who saved the human race but didn\u2019t have time to do his own taxes,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. \u201cIf you want people to have financial health, you need to do it for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Oakland Fire: What We Know About the Warehouse Owner", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byAmong the targets of our reporting is finding out about the owner of the sprawling warehouse that burst into flames on Dec. 2. Property records show that her name is Chor Nar Siu Ng and that she bought the building in 1988.Did Ms. Ng know anything about the dangers at the Ghost Ship? And if so, what did she do to fix them?For the past week, I\u2019ve been trying to learn more about Ms. Ng, combing through records at the Alameda County clerk-recorder\u2019s office, interviewing people all over Oakland\u2019s Chinatown \u2014 where she owns several properties \u2014 and trying to track down her children, who helped her run her businesses. So far, no one has found her.Through documents and interviews, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned about Chor Nar Siu Ng:\u2022 First, Ms. Ng owns several properties in the Bay Area \u2014 roughly 10 \u2014 most of which are in Oakland. She owns the warehouse that burned, at 1315 31st Avenue, as well as an adjacent lot to the south and an adjacent building to the north.That building houses a Boost Mobile store, a boutique called Moda and a family-owned religious goods shop called Botanica 3 MMM.\u2022 Second, the city has spent years fining Ms. Ng for what it calls \u201cnuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious\u201d conditions at the lot south of the warehouse and at the building to the north.While it\u2019s difficult to determine exactly how much Ms. Ng has paid because of these conditions, tax records offer a clue: Between 2005 and 2014, Ms. Ng paid $26,570.20 in \u201ccode enforcement\u201d fees to the city of Oakland for the lot next to the Ghost Ship.I\u2019ve reached out to the city to ask about the specifics of what led to these fines. Messages were also left with two of Ms. Ng\u2019s children, as well as with a lawyer named Gerard Lam, who represented Ms. Ng in a previous dispute with a tenant. There\u2019s been no response yet.\u2022 Third, it\u2019s clear that Ms. Ng had at least some presence in the warehouse area. Several people who used to live at the Ghost Ship have said Ms. Ng or her daughter would come by the warehouse, first alerting Derick Ion Almena, the man who rented the place from them.What\u2019s not clear is whether the Ngs entered the building and saw what was inside: a jury-rigged staircase, a blocked exit upstairs, webs of extension cords, propane tanks used to heat water and piles of flammable debris.Now that it\u2019s evident that Ms. Ng has a string of properties around the city, it will be important to try to find her tenants.What did they think of how she ran her buildings? Did they feel safe?For about 20 years, Griselda Ceja and her family rented a portion of the building next to the burned warehouse. From there, Ms. Ceja ran a beauty salon she called Griselda\u2019s. (The salon is still listed on Google Maps.)\u201cShe never took care of the building,\u201d Ms. Ceja said. \u201cWe were scared. We were all scared.\u201dMs. Ceja, 43, described troubling conditions: a circuit box and light fixtures that sparked as she dried customers\u2019 hair. A blocked emergency exit. An aged electric system that failed constantly. There were also rats in the walls and holes in the floors.She wanted to go elsewhere but couldn\u2019t afford to, she said.Ms. Ceja said she complained frequently to Ms. Ng and her relatives, communicating through letters, phone calls and text messages. After about a year, Ms. Ceja said, the Ngs added a second circuit box, an effort to stop the sparking.Ms. Ceja said she called the city once, about a decade ago, to complain about the rats. She said an Oakland official came by, but she didn\u2019t press him to take action.\u201cHe said the building would close if he did something about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand everyone would go out of business.\u201d A request has been sent to the city for documents that would confirm this.Ms. Ceja suggested talking to Leo Barrera, who had worked with her at the salon, to verify her account.\u201cWe told them many times: \u2018Please, if you could fix this, we need light, or water, or an emergency exit,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barrera, 36, said at her new beauty shop. \u201cThe most basic. Nothing more. We weren\u2019t asking for luxuries,\u201d she said.\u201cIn the case that the building caught on fire,\u201d she added, \u201chow would we have exited?\u201dDid everyone have such problems?On Friday, I went to Chinatown, where at least three properties are in Ms. Ng\u2019s name. Michelle Leung, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, who speaks Cantonese, came along to interpret.At a grocery, a Vietnamese restaurant and a building that houses the California Chinese Orchestra, no one knew her. But at Sum Yee Pastry, the owner \u2014 a man who would not give his name \u2014 said his family had rented from Ms. Ng for a decade.No major problems, he said, just a few leaks, which he fixed himself.Later, back at the scene of the fire, a woman named Rose Martinez, 31, was standing outside Botanica 3 MMM near tears.Her family started the business about 20 years ago, she said. The fire had caused considerable water and smoke damage, and the business is now closed.The Ngs had been good to them, she said, even letting the family skip rent one month after her father died.But the faulty electricity and the rats had been a real problem, Ms. Martinez said. Of the fire, she said, \u201closswise, I don\u2019t know how to put it into words.\u201dHow often did they see Ms. Ng or her family members at the warehouse?And it\u2019s important to hear from city officials about their interactions with the landlord.Lastly, all of this is a part of a larger question: Who will ultimately be held legally responsible for the fire? Could lawyers who\u2019ve worked on other cases involving major fires provide any advice?P.S.: Readers, I want to know when the warehouse at 1315 31st Avenue was built and what it had been in past years. A canning factory? A dairy? The Oakland History Room, the Oakland Heritage Survey and the University of California\u2019s Earth Sciences and Map Library have all provided some clues, but nothing definitive so far. Suggestions?\u2014 JULIE TURKEWITZWhen we took on this project last week, we hoped for feedback from readers. What we got was well beyond our expectations: a torrent of tips, expertise, links to documents and anguished readers describing their experiences with the housing crisis in the Bay Area.Architects, fire marshals, lawyers, artists and concerned residents were among the hundreds of readers who wrote us, creating a trove of contacts for the reporters working on the project.Janet Van Ham, a photographer, wrote to describe precarious spaces that she has rented in Oakland. When I called Ms. Van Ham to follow up, she said she had an epiphany over the summer at her third-floor loft in an old warehouse.\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018If there was a fire in here, how would I get out?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no safety plan, no enforcement.\u201d She moved out in August.Serena Elston, a carpenter and wood sculptor who lives in a loft in Fruitvale, the neighborhood where the Ghost Ship is, wrote about the plight of artists and the powerful but intangible sense of community in Oakland among them.I drove to Ms. Elston\u2019s ivy-covered converted warehouse with Jim Wilson, our San Francisco bureau photographer. Ms. Elston\u2019s studio, filled with power saws and timber, has a sprinkler system. But we spoke about the many other people in Oakland who live more precariously.\u201cIt\u2019s a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell situation,\u201d Ms. Elston said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you know your electrical system is super messed up. Are you going to call your landlord in? Is he going to fix it or kick you out?\u201dWe are grateful to all those who wrote, and we welcome more information as we continue the project.\u2014 THOMAS FULLERAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Whatchamacallit Economy", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt\u2019s a hip, fast-growing sector of the economy, filled with headline-grabbing companies: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Task Rabbit. But there\u2019s a gnawing problem: People aren\u2019t sure what to call it. Many critics dislike the term most commonly used, the \u201csharing economy,\u201d because there often isn\u2019t much actual sharing going on. Others prefer to call it the on-demand economy, peer-to-peer economy, crowd-based economy, gig economy or collaborative economy.Uber, Lyft and other e-hailing companies love to say they are \u201cride-sharing companies,\u201d signaling that they are collaborative and not crassly capitalistic. These companies maintain that their drivers share their cars with passengers and use apps to share information about where they are. But many academics and workers in this sector assert that the business model seems less like sharing than like traditional corporate profit-making that happens to use an app.Rochelle LaPlante, who works for Mechanical Turk, an internet platform for people to post and find piecework jobs, sees public relations spin behind the term \u201csharing economy.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an exchange of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really sharing if a person\u2019s paying for it.\u201dHer point: If you\u2019re living in San Francisco and you want to drive to Palo Alto and take a friend with you (perhaps splitting the cost of gas), that\u2019s ride sharing. But if you take an Uber to get to Palo Alto, that seems more like a taxi ride.Arun Sundararajan, author of the new book \u201cThe Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism,\u201d said he chose that term for his title because so many people use it. Yet Mr. Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, actually prefers \u201ccrowd-based capitalism,\u201d because a crowd of consumers obtains services by connecting, via a platform, with a crowd of suppliers.In the early 2000s, the sharing economy generally referred to people with underused assets \u2014 whether automobiles, homes or vacuum cleaners \u2014 who let others \u201cshare\u201d them, usually for a fee. Such sharing was viewed not as a business but as a way to promote sustainability.\u201cThe \u2018sharing economy\u2019 phrase has stuck,\u201d Professor Sundararajan said, partly because it suggests a personal touch \u2014 say, an Airbnb host putting visitors up in a spare bedroom. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection that people seem to enjoy.\u201d (Even though some say that the Airbnb hosts who own a dozen apartments are not really sharing.)Ms. Botsman added that some companies can legitimately be called sharing companies, like Turo (previously called RelayRides), which enables car owners to rent out their unused cars, and BlaBlaCar, which connects riders with car owners planning to drive from one city to another.With the term \u201csharing economy\u201d under scrutiny, experts are casting about for substitutes. Miriam A. Cherry, a St. Louis University law professor, recommends the \u201con-demand economy,\u201d but critics say that isn\u2019t exact enough, because ordering a pizza by phone can be considered part of an on-demand economy. Others prefer \u201cgig economy,\u201d but some assert that phrase isn\u2019t suitable for 21st-century app-based companies because gig workers \u2014 think jazz musicians \u2014 have been around for decades.Some embrace \u201cplatform economy,\u201d but Geoffrey G. Parker, an engineering professor at Dartmouth and the author of \u201cPlatform Revolution,\u201d says that name is too broad because it includes giants like Google, Facebook and YouTube. Others like the \u201capp-based on-demand economy\u201d (the Abode economy), the \u201cgig on-demand economy\u201d (the GOD economy) or the \u201cplatform on-demand economy\u201d (the POD economy), whose workers could be called pods.Despite the criticism that \u201csharing economy\u201d is inaccurate and sounds like corporate spin, Professor Sundararajan says we might be stuck with that description because corporations and the public so often use it. When Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue latch on to a phrase, it\u2019s not easy to shake it off.Steven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tent Cities of San Francisco", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California may be the new capital of American liberalism, but everybody who likes the sound of that ought to consider the fate of three recent San Francisco ballot initiatives.The first, Proposition Q, aimed to eliminate homeless people\u2019s unsightly tent camps by banning sidewalk tents and empowering the police to confiscate them with 24 hours notice so long as occupants were offered beds in shelters. San Francisco has only 1,203 emergency adult shelter beds, for a homeless population of 6,700, but a second initiative, Proposition J, promised to ease that shortfall by earmarking $50 million a year from a small sales-tax increase, proposed in a third initiative, Proposition K.In an exquisite illustration of California\u2019s core political neurosis \u2014 the tension between our attachment to the pretty view and our desire to care for the least among us without personal inconvenience, even as our population and economy explode \u2014 we San Franciscans voted yes on Q and J, and no on K. The people spoke, in other words, and we said, \u201cGet rid of those filthy tents and set aside heaps of money to make sure it\u2019s done in a compassionate way so I don\u2019t have to feel guilty, but don\u2019t squeeze me for a dime.\u201dSimilar contradictions were on display this month, after the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland killed 36 people. We lamented the deaths, but it was easier to criticize the warehouse owner and operator than face the desperation that drove so many to live there.San Francisco\u2019s homeless population, it bears mentioning, increased less than 7 percent over the last 10 years. Tent camps are nothing new. According to Jeff Kositsky, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, what has changed is their visibility. Tech-boom construction has filled empty lots where people \u201cexperiencing homelessness\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the preferred term \u2014 formerly slept in seclusion.\u201cWe also had one individual purchase and give away $15,000 worth of camping tents,\u201d Mr. Kositsky told me. \u201cOther organizations were giving them out as well, and now we\u2019ve got 80 encampments in the city.\u201d The individual in question turned out to be a graphic designer named Shaun Osburn who told me that, with help from a former taxi driver named Tara Spalty, he gave away more than 350 tents.This camp reportedly had 350 residents at one point, including a slumlord (tentlord?) who rented his spare tents for a few bucks a week. Conventional wisdom holds that such places are populated by drug addicts and the mentally ill, and elements of that camp supported this, from piles of garbage to apparent meth heads toiling over piles of disassembled bicycles. There was something so sane, however, about the tidy rows into which all these tents were arranged that it brought to mind a national-park campground.This resonance was not lost on the tent dwellers. Crystal Erickson, a 36-year-old who had been homeless for three years, told me, ruefully, \u201cWe call it the urban camping experience.\u201dNearby, on Seventh Street, another group built wooden shanties along a narrow strip of concrete between a street that clogs with rush-hour traffic and a railway that roars with commuter trains in the shadow of a sprawling new biotech center. Germaine Spann, a member of this crew, told me that he scavenged materials from the Dumpsters at the immense luxury-condo construction site that loomed overhead. He scaled his boxlike home for legal parking spaces, built it on wheels for easy relocation, installed a lockable door and a glass window, and painted a sign that said: \u201cBox City 7th Street. They may look like boxes to you, but to us they are home.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re ships,\u201d said Jason Albertson, a member of the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team. \u201cEverybody\u2019s building a lifeboat and living in it.\u201dSimilar outbreaks of ad hoc shelter appeared elsewhere around California and, indeed, all over the West Coast and even Hawaii. In Los Angeles, where the total homeless population grew 11 percent from 2015 to 2016 \u2014 to an astonishing 28,464 people \u2014 the number of makeshift dwellings grew 85 percent. In San Diego, the homeless population declined while those in handmade shelters grew 69 percent. Sacramento was so overwhelmed by tent dwellers that the city is contemplating creating a \u201csafe ground\u201d zone, while Santa Barbara has designated \u201csafe parking\u201d lots for people who occupy vehicles.Activists soon gathered signatures for ballot initiatives like Proposition HHH in Los Angeles, which aimed to create a $1.2 billion bond for new supportive and affordable housing as well as facilities, and Measure A in Santa Clara County, which authorized a $950 million bond for affordable housing.Public outcry included disbelief that our wealthy progressive city allows people to suffer so; assertions that our homeless come from elsewhere because of the warm weather and San Francisco\u2019s generous public services; and the notorious \u201cTech Bro\u201d letter of Feb. 15, addressed to the mayor and police chief by an entrepreneur named Justin Keller. Mr. Keller announced that he had been living in San Francisco \u201cfor over three years,\u201d declared homelessness \u201cthe worst it has ever been,\u201d and shrugged off culpability as an agent of gentrification.Mr. Kositsky, the city official, did not entirely disagree. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to demonize people who complain, who want their kids safe and don\u2019t want to step on needles and feces and be kept up all night by loud music,\u201d he told me.Patrick Kennedy, a developer, proposed solving the problem with micro-apartments that look like shipping containers (fabrication to be outsourced to China, of course), stacked into supportive communities, and rented to the city at $1,000 a month. Meanwhile, with the financial backing of wealthy investors, Supervisor Mark Farrell, a moderate who represents affluent neighborhoods, placed Proposition Q on the ballot.Mr. Keller seems like a smart fellow. He has doubtless learned by now that homelessness is decidedly not the worst it has ever been in San Francisco and also that it ranks up there with sunshine among California\u2019s defining phenomena. As The San Francisco Chronicle reported in October, the South of Market district favored by tech firms like Mr. Keller\u2019s has been a gathering place for the homeless since at least 1872, when an observer noted the concentration of \u201cblanket men\u201d who seemed to be mostly \u201crunaway sailors,\u201d \u201cold soldiers\u201d and \u201cbankrupt German scene painters.\u201d The city\u2019s homeless population peaked at 8,640 in 2002.Californian outrage over homelessness is likewise evergreen, as documented by the journalist Caleb Pershan, who found examples that ranged from a 1986 Chronicle columnist\u2019s comment that \u201cthe annual homeless crisis came to San Francisco early this year\u201d to a 2001 article mocking Mayor Willie Brown\u2019s belated acknowledgment that homelessness harmed the city\u2019s image \u2014 \u201cstunning the many merchants and residents who have been sounding that theme since the beginning of the mayor\u2019s first term six years ago.\u201dMr. Keller is less an outlier rube, in other words, than a genuine Californian, struggling to reconcile the Golden State of our shared dreams with unsettling evidence. Grumblings that our homeless come from elsewhere for services express that denial by insisting that we are too compassionate \u2014 not inadequately so \u2014 and therefore bear no responsibility for losers who wash up on our sidewalks. It is not immaterial that newcomers really do keep showing up in droves, in California, and that people who got here yesterday have a long history of feeling unnerved by those who arrived 10 minutes ago. Dust Bowl migrants, for example, were so resented that legislators passed a 1937 \u201canti-Okie\u201d law a that criminalized the bringing of \u201cany indigent person\u201d into California.San Francisco city statistics, meanwhile, suggest that most of our homeless are as Californian as anyone with a roof over their heads. A one-night census of the homeless in January 2015 found that 71 percent had lived here at the time they became homeless, and half of those had lived in San Francisco for 10 or more years.I recently heard a tech-industry veteran \u2014 a friend, born on the East Coast \u2014 suggest that proposals to build low-income housing here were misguided because of the high cost of California real estate. A more efficient alternative, he explained, would be to construct homeless shelters somewhere cheap, like Nevada. Aside from the unpleasant specter of the police forcing desperate mothers and children onto buses bound for desert concentration camps (and how long would you have to be homeless to get exiled?), my friend\u2019s remark helped me see what lurks beneath Mr. Keller\u2019s contention that wealthy people have a right to be here because they \u201cgot an education, work hard, and earned it.\u201dAmericans have been coming to California to make it big for so long \u2014 on wagons bound for the Gold Rush, via Route 66 for 1950s aerospace jobs \u2014 that a tacit understanding flourishes in certain quarters by which California is less a homeland full of locals like anywhere else than a reality show with a self-deportation approach to voting contestants off the island. As soon as you can\u2019t pay the bills, and regardless of whether your great-grandparents were born here, you\u2019re expected to get lost, or at least move to Seattle.Discussion of causes, along with the noise about weather and drug addiction, typically includes Ronald Reagan\u2019s evisceration of federal funding for subsidized housing and public mental health hospitals. Conventional homeless shelters get blamed, too, because of their tendency to separate romantic partners and forbid both pets and the storage of belongings \u2014 such that a few nights indoors might cost a person love, companionship and all their survival gear.Frigid New York City, however, has more homeless per capita than San Francisco or Los Angeles, while only 7 percent of Los Angeles homeless arrived less than a year ago, fewer than the 8.5 percent of all Los Angeles County residents to have done so, suggesting that sunshine is no more of an inducement to the destitute than to anyone else. National surveys also find that 20 percent to 25 percent of the homeless have serious mental health problems and an estimated 26 percent abuse drugs. San Francisco has also pioneered a new model of homeless shelter, known as a Navigation Center, that invites entire encampments \u2014 pets included \u2014 to come in from the cold together.The economic factors that correlate most strongly with homelessness, furthermore, according to research published in 2001 by the Public Policy Institute of California, are precisely those that bedevil every aspect of California life: extreme income inequality combined with upward-spiraling housing costs. For decades, even as employment booms have led to population booms, California voters \u2014 myself among them \u2014 have fought to freeze the good life in amber by resisting increases in housing density and mass transit.Viewed in this light, sidewalk tents are merely a rational response to an incoherent society.Californians came together for public works in the mid-20th century \u2014 freeways, public housing, the finest public schools and universities in the nation. Caring for the least among us, however, has never been a hallmark of California liberalism, and our most notable innovations of the past 50 years have been more about environmental conservation, tolerance and technology \u2014 sustainable agriculture, gay marriage, Snapchat \u2014 than formation of mutual aid societies, except for communes and cults that end with industrial-scale marijuana cultivation or mass suicide. The technology industry takes this to a millennial extreme by celebrating the moral neutrality enshrined in Google\u2019s corporate motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil.\u201dOn the upside, our political leaders \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown chief among them \u2014 see with clarity that our only defensible path forward involves the end of Nimby resistance to change and the mass construction of denser housing and public transit guided by enlightened city planning to create a more livable and sustainable future. Voters all over California did pass big bond measures in support of new housing for the homeless, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, recently made a $10 million gift meant to eliminate family homelessness in San Francisco. Facebook has likewise announced plans to create 1,500 units of housing near its Menlo Park headquarters \u2014 a colossal political breakthrough, in our stunted moral climate \u2014 with 15 percent designated affordable and $20 million dedicated to the development of still more affordable housing and tenants\u2019 rights services.In the meantime, San Francisco city employees can start giving all those tent dwellers 24 hours notice to clear out, backed by offers of, well, pretty much nothing at all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Wrestling With a Legacy of Eugenics", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Not terribly long ago, the sterilization of mentally ill patients was common practice in the United States.Of 32 states that had eugenics laws, none used the practice as much as California. (Virginia was a distant second.)From 1919 to 1952, California\u2019s state homes and hospitals sterilized about 20,000 people under eugenics laws that were intended to cure societal ills by halting the procreation of people deemed inferior.California officially apologized in 2003. Yet the victims were never compensated.Now, after several years of scholarly detective work, a team of researchers have created a detailed catalog of the California victims. Analyzing the data, they estimate that as many as 831 individuals, with an average age of 88, could still be alive.Patient records showed how the eugenics program was driven by the prejudices of the day. Poor people and the offspring of immigrants were more likely to be sterilized. Criminality and promiscuity were cited as justifications.\u201cSly, profane, obstinate, stealthy, dangerous to public health, low idea of morality, mentally below par,\u201d reads the 1926 case file of one woman who was selected for sterilization at Sonoma State Home in Eldridge.He said the new catalog \u2014 which includes names, birth dates and other personal information \u2014 could help solve that problem. But time is of the essence, he added: \u201cThe waiting strategy is bound to give you one result and that is that people are going to die while you\u2019re waiting.\u201dEven decades after their procedures, many remained haunted.One man said he was so ashamed that he never told his wife. Other victims spoke of an abiding sorrow over their inability to have children.\u201cI see all my friends and they have children,\u201d one woman was quoted as saying. \u201cI love kids. Sometime now when I babysit, I hold the baby up to myself and think to myself, \u2018Why was I ever sterilized?\u2019\u201dIn the 1990s, Humboldt County was deeply divided over the cutting of its ancient redwoods.Environmental activists chained themselves to trees, blocked logging roads and held sit-ins at the offices of the Pacific Lumber Company, which had extensive timber holdings in the county.It was this week in 1999 that Ms. Hill finally came down from her 180-foot perch after a deal was reached to permanently protect the tree (which she named Luna).For 738 days in the tree, also known as the Stafford Giant, Ms. Hill survived on supplies hoisted by supporters and endured at times harsh weather, illness and loneliness.She proved an effective campaigner, writing letters and taking interviews. The news media gravitated to the story and helped make her an emblem of the anti-logging movement.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Uber Bets on Artificial Intelligence With Acquisition and New Lab", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byEnter Gary Marcus and Zoubin Ghahramani. The two men are being appointed as co-directors of Uber\u2019s new in-house research arm on artificial intelligence, which the ride-hailing company unveiled on Monday. The research arm\u2019s aim is to apply A.I. in areas like self-driving vehicles, along with solving other technological challenges through machine learning.All 15 people from the start-up will be absorbed by Uber. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The acquisition and new research arm, which will be called Uber\u2019s A.I. Labs, exemplifies how seriously Silicon Valley tech companies are betting on artificial intelligence. Google, Facebook and others have also pushed into artificial intelligence, which underlies voice recognition software, digital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, and technologies like self-driving cars. Many companies are racing to bring on new A.I. talent to compete against one another.\u201cEvery major company realizes how essential A.I. is to what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of data people are operating on, even the smallest gains in efficiency can turn out enormous changes at these companies, especially in terms of profit.\u201dMany of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, have tried to commercialize artificial intelligence through the application of algorithms modeled largely on how the human brain functions. This method, called deep learning, leans heavily on the vast data sets that private technology companies own and that are used to train computers to do simple tasks, such as match patterns or recognize faces in photographs.Part of what drew Uber to Dr. Marcus\u2019s team is that his start-up is tackling artificial intelligence in a different way. Rather than taking just one approach like deep learning, Geometric Intelligence combines data scientists who use varying techniques to study artificial intelligence, including the Bayesian and \u201cevolutionary\u201d methods.Dr. Marcus, who helped found Geometric Intelligence in late 2014, said the gist of his philosophy goes something like this: Instead of training machines by feeding them enormous amounts of data, what if computers were capable of learning more like humans by extrapolating a system of rules from just a few or even a single example?Besides autonomous vehicles, Uber said it expected its A.I. Labs to apply its method to other tasks, including combating fraud, extracting information from street signs and learning to improve its mapping research and capabilities.\u201cWhen step function changes in this field occur, we\u2019re going to see very significant differences in how businesses run themselves,\u201d Jeff Holden, Uber\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. He said the A.I. Labs and Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, which is home to the company\u2019s self-driving car research, will work in tandem with each other.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long time before a self-driving car will be able to make all the kinds of trips that Uber does every single day,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cBut the answers to this are all going to come in the form of artificial intelligence.\u201dMr. Holden said recruiting A.I. research talent is highly competitive, especially as Google, Apple and Tesla are also developing self-driving cars or related projects.\u201cFrom a defensive perspective, if someone else develops them first, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a new co-director of Uber\u2019s in-house research arm on artificial intelligence.

{"Headline": "Wonder and Worry, as a Syrian Child Transforms", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Canada welcomes Syrian refugees like no other country. But for one 10-year-old\u2019s parents, is she leaving too much behind?Supported byTORONTO \u2014 As soon as Bayan Mohammad, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, arrived here last winter, she began her transformation. In her first hour of ice-skating, she managed to glide on her own. She made fast friends with girls different from any she had ever known. New to competitive sports, she propelled herself down the school track so fast that she was soon collecting ribbons.Bayan glued herself to the movie \u201cAnnie,\u201d the ballet \u201cCinderella\u201d and episodes of \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d all stories of metamorphosis. As her English went from halting to chatty, she ticked off everything she hungered to do: An overnight school trip. Gymnastics lessons. Building a snowman \u2014 no, a snow-woman.\u201cI just want to be Canadian,\u201d she said.The volunteers resettling her family \u2014 a group of teachers, pediatricians and other friends and neighbors spurred by devastating images of young refugees and casualties of war \u2014 watched Bayan with wonder. Her parents, Abdullah and Eman Mohammad, a former grocery store owner and a nurse from a rural village, felt both pride and alarm.The Mohammads were astonished and grateful. But over 10 months, the relationship was reshaping the family, rewriting roles and rules they had always followed. Abdullah and Eman found their marriage on new ground, the fundamental compact between them shifting. Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their now-obliterated life in Syria. On some days, her parents believed that she could meld her old and new identities; on others, they feared her Syrianness was being erased.If the family had landed in Munich or Minneapolis, they would have encountered new cultural dilemmas, too. But Canada\u2019s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another\u2019s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. \u201cWhat they gave us, a brother wouldn\u2019t even give to his own brother,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said.Still, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons \u2014 which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday?The Mohammads had left Syria and then Jordan to safeguard their children \u2014 but once they arrived here, they were bewildered by what they found. Why were teenagers here allowed to stay out past midnight? Did children move away from home at 18 and never look back? How much control did parents even have?\u201cEvery day I have this dilemma,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. \u201cAm I letting the kids do the right thing?\u201dIn October, Bayan craved one item above all on her wish list: to join her school\u2019s overnight trip. For three days at the end of the month, the whole fifth grade would travel to an island in Toronto\u2019s harbor, exploring, conducting science experiments and sleeping in dorms.\u201cI want to go but my dad said no,\u201d Bayan said over a family lunch of chicken and stuffed cabbage rolls.Her parents felt their children belonged at home; they had never been on a sleepover.\u201cI want to go!\u201d Bayan repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sad because my best friends are going.\u201d By Canadian or American standards, she was being polite: no eye-rolling or accusations.But in Syria, children are bound to respect the authority of their parents, even in adulthood. The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud.\u201cShe\u2019s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,\u201d her mother explained.Bayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group. Meticulous and restrained, Ms. McLorg never wanted to push the Mohammads, and when they asked for her advice, she tended to answer with clinical distance, lest her own preferences show.But she knew Bayan yearned for the adventure. She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl\u2019s integration into Canada. Her two children had gone on the trip years ago and still talked about the traditions \u2014 visiting a lighthouse, telling ghost stories.\u201cEvery kid in Toronto does this,\u201d Ms. McLorg had told Bayan\u2019s parents when they had asked. \u201cAcademically, it\u2019s not important. But socially, it is very important.\u201dMr. Mohammad told Bayan again: No trip. He was not an immigrant who set out to adapt to a new world; he was a refugee trying to hold on to what had been ripped from him. \u201cWe\u2019re forced to be here,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said later. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, but we\u2019re forced to be here.\u201dHe still had a shot at preserving the identity he wanted for Bayan, but he and his wife would have to be vigilant, willing to deny their daughter some of what she wanted.\u201cI will do this for her,\u201d he said. \u201cGod help us.\u201dOnly one thing about Canada seemed to disconcert Bayan: its types of families she had never seen or even imagined. She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. \u201cMy mom and dad, they will not do that,\u201d she declared.The Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband\u2019s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah\u2019s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children.Now she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework.Being in Canada \u201copened new doors for me that I didn\u2019t even know existed,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said.Her husband, however, was having difficulty. In Syria, he co-owned a grocery store and two butcher shops, and had been the unquestioned head of the household. Now the sponsors were helping support his family, along with government subsidies. While his wife went to one of the therapy groups, he took care of Bayan and the younger children, and he had been helping in the kitchen.\u201cSometimes I feel weak doing these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s job.\u201d He told himself that spending more time with his children would draw them closer.Bayan had ambitions for her father: to learn to swim, to drive, to buy a car with six seats. \u201cI dream, like, all the time we have a big house and a pool,\u201d she said.But Mr. Mohammad was nowhere near finding work that could support a family of six in an expensive city, and he felt torn about whether he should continue to study English full time or just get the best job he could. \u201cI feel lost,\u201d he had said. Because his wife\u2019s language skills were better, he sometimes was left out of conversations. (The Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, because they feared reprisals against relatives still in Syria. This article uses part of their family name.)If Syria heals, Mr. Mohammad said, he definitely wants to go back.His wife countered: \u201cMy future and my kids\u2019 future is in this country.\u201dThen they laughed. The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil. Mrs. Mohammad\u2019s counseling groups were filled with women whose husbands had turned bitter at the changed circumstances. Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse.The Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband\u2019s authority \u2014 before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one\u2019s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, \u201cflexibility.\u201dEven as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls\u2019 school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone.Now that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter\u2019s life. \u201cI want to try everything here,\u201d Bayan said.On the day of the school trip, with her classmates off on Toronto Island in a freezing rain, the family moved on to their next cultural debate.\u201cWhat is the meaning of Halloween?\u201d Mrs. Mohammad asked. The holiday was four days away.Bayan burst with answers. It was about being frightened in a fun way, she said, dressing as skeletons and ghosts. \u201cIt has to be something scary,\u201d she explained. She wanted to wear a devil costume.One of the sponsors had already arranged to take them trick-or-treating. But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead?Just then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family\u2019s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve. Bayan had asked Ms. McLorg to join them for the coming trick-or-treat date, but the sponsor did not realize how Mrs. Mohammad felt.Ms. McLorg was trying to introduce Canadian customs without imposing on the family\u2019s own. \u201cThey should not have to change their essence in order to become Canadian,\u201d Ms. McLorg said later. In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture.In the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess.Abdullah Mohammad headed home early; Bayan pleaded to stay later. Her mother surveyed the spiderwebs and chains lacing the street, watching her children merge into the flowing highway of trick-or-treaters.Two weeks later, Mrs. Mohammad and her two daughters were propelled into a local Walmart by Bayan\u2019s sheer force of will. She longed for a pair of sparkly purple sneakers, and begged, nagged and nearly cried until her mother agreed.As they navigated the aisles, mother and daughters looked like members of two different families. Mrs. Mohammad wore her head scarf, neck-to-toe gown and shawl, while the girls were in leggings and skinny jeans.The question about when Bayan would start covering her head loomed over her and her parents. As they were in Canada, her mother was willing to postpone it until seventh grade.\u201cNo!\u201d Bayan yelled when she overheard her mother talking about it. She looked ugly with her head covered, she thought. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in grade nine \u2014 maybe,\u201d she said.But the next day, Bayan and her mother slipped inside a building a few blocks from their apartment, where the 10-year-old kicked off the brand-new sneakers and knelt. Her mother draped a thin scarf over her daughter\u2019s head, expertly folding, tucking and pinning until it covered her hair without a strand showing.This was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan\u2019s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning; that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss.Sunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head.For the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an 18-year-old whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. \u201cSometimes there are tests in life,\u201d she told the children. \u201cAnd sometimes they break us.\u201dThen she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to break things when they\u2019re all together, right?\u201d Ms. Ali asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly like us.\u201dBut it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan\u2019s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at \u201cCat in the Hat\u201d level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school.Other classmates\u2019 parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is foreign-born, a reflection of Canada\u2019s openness to immigrants. In her apartment building, Bayan has friends whose families are from Israel and China.When her father picked her up, she could not take off her hijab fast enough. During lunch at home, as she chatted in English, he interjected: \u201cArabic!\u201d She continued in a mix of both.When she talked about the stick exercise, her father gave a look of recognition. \u201cI was Bayan\u2019s age when they told me the same story,\u201d he said.Their childhoods seemed so disconnected from one another\u2019s. The family left Syria when Bayan was 7 or 8 \u2014 they had foundered in Jordan before coming to Canada \u2014 and her memories of the home where her family had lived for three generations were dimming.She could picture playing hide-and-seek with her cousins by the fountain and grapevines in the courtyard, and recall the way an adjacent garden produced enough mint for the whole neighborhood. But Bayan and her sister could no longer agree on how many olive trees stood there: 20? 100? (Eight, their mother said.)After the Mohammads left Syria, the house next door was shelled or bombed and collapsed on their own home. It was ruined now, the second story gone. The sponsors helped them use Google Maps to try to find what was left, but no one could quite pinpoint it.\u201cI love that house,\u201d Bayan had said a few days before.Suddenly, her confidence and determination kicked in.\u201cWe\u2019re going to build it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy siblings. All of us.\u201dLynsey Addario contributed reporting. Heba Gowayed contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple and Nokia Battle Over Cellphone Patents", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone is a technological marvel. You can watch streaming video on it, download apps, take photos with its camera and give voice commands to Siri, its digital assistant. You can even make old-fashioned voice calls on it.Nokia, the Finnish company that was the world\u2019s largest cellphone maker until its business was decimated by Apple and makers of Android-based phones, claims none of those features would exist without its inventions, which were made over many years and after billions of dollars were invested in research.For the past five years, Apple has paid Nokia a modest royalty for the use of its patents. But with that pact about to expire on Dec. 31, Nokia wants Apple to keep paying for that portfolio, and is demanding that Apple license additional patents. Apple is refusing to pay Nokia\u2019s price and has accused it of extortion.\u201cApple is saying, we want to pay one low price and not have to deal with any of your patents again,\u201d Clem Roberts, an intellectual property lawyer at Durie Tangri in San Francisco, said. \u201cNokia is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want that low price because my patents are worth more than that.\u2019\u201dThe fight underscores just how much today\u2019s smartphones rely on an earlier generation of technology. It also shows how cellphone pioneers like Nokia, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola, whose patents are now owned by Google, are still trying to profit from the industry in which they are now bit players, at best.\u201cObviously, the iPhone was not created on a green field but was built on what others created before Apple,\u201d said Florian Mueller, a German iPhone app developer and former consultant to technology companies who has followed the cellphone patent wars. \u201cOn the other hand, the iPhone was a paradigm shift. It was more of a mobile computer than a mobile phone.\u201dBut the tactics are evolving as the law and technology change.Companies like Nokia and Ericsson, which once had an interest in exchanging mutual licenses with other companies for their own cellphone businesses, left the handset market and concentrated on other tech gear and licensing their old patents. Nokia and Ericsson each make more than a billion dollars a year from licensing their patents and brands globally, their annual reports say.Nokia has split its patent portfolio and transferred slices to so-called patent trolls \u2014 a derisive term for companies that buy others\u2019 intellectual property and often file lawsuits to extract royalties from patent users \u2014 with Nokia sharing in any profits.\u201cUnfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple\u2019s own inventions they had nothing to do with,\u201d Apple said in a statement about the case.In response, Nokia filed legal cases against Apple in 14 venues, from Texas to Japan, on Wednesday and Thursday, accusing it of violating 40 patents. Nokia said it had reached patent deals with more than 100 other companies, including many smartphone makers, which demonstrated that it had offered its intellectual property at a fair price.\u201cAfter several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple\u2019s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,\u201d Ilkka Rahnasto, the head of Nokia\u2019s patent business, said in a statement.Analysts say there is no doubt that Nokia owns important patents, which include those related to how phones transmit data and how their batteries consume energy.\u201cUnless there\u2019s a fair return on this technology, the whole model for the telecom world is at risk,\u201d Gustav Brismark, Ericsson\u2019s chief intellectual property officer, said. He added that the company had invested billions of dollars over decades in its patents.In the past, Mr. Brismark said, companies quickly reached agreements over how to use Ericsson\u2019s patents. But in the past five years, companies like Apple have more often turned to courts to reach settlements.As Nokia seeks to require Apple to pay to license more of its patents, some of its recent claims may be hard to justify. In one of its lawsuits filed on Wednesday, it says Apple is violating a patent Nokia received two months ago for an electronic device case that includes a hole for a camera lens in the back and room for a battery beneath the display, features that have been common to smartphones for many years.Still, Mr. Roberts said American courts have been skeptical of patent-related antitrust claims like those by Apple. \u201cThe whole point of the government granting these patents is that it was giving the inventor a monopoly over that invention,\u201d he said.But Apple and Nokia are fighters, and too much is at stake for either to give up easily.\u201cWhat is a fair return on technology that has been shared with everyone?\u201d Mr. Brismark of Ericsson said. \u201cYou have to create the right incentives for tech pioneers.\u201dVindu Goel reported from San Francisco and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Gives Samsung a Reprieve in Apple Patent Case", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byA federal law says that companies found liable for infringing design patents on an \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, turned on the meaning of the quoted phrase.Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers \u2014 here, Samsung\u2019s phones \u2014 and sometimes be the components found to have infringed a design patent.\u201cAll told,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote, \u201cApple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung\u2019s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.\u201dDesign patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in over a century.\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the appellate court said.Justice Sotomayor\u2019s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the whole phone or just parts of it. She said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that \u201cthe relevant \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 must always be the end product sold to the consumer.\u201d\u201cIn the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote. \u201cIn the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.\u201dThe Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration, drawing out the final resolution of a case that has transfixed Silicon Valley since it was filed in 2011.Technology companies often imitate innovations made by their rivals and incorporate hundreds or thousands of patented ideas in a new product. The largest companies often cross-license their patents to one another to minimize infringement claims.The Supreme Court battle between Apple and Samsung centered on what happens when the infringement involves just a few features of a product\u2019s design.Apple \u2014 backed by dozens of independent designers as well as fashion-focused companies like Nike and Tiffany \u2014 argued that design is central to many products and that a patent violator should be forced to turn over the full profits it made from infringing designs.Samsung \u2014 whose position was backed by Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, eBay and HP \u2014 argued that any penalties should be proportionate to the importance of the infringing features to the overall product.The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, while not decisively resolving the case, found that liability in design patent cases is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition. But the justices declined to offer more specific guidance. So now Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the smartphone market, will go back to court to wrangle over the appropriate amount of damages for Samsung\u2019s infringement.In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said, \u201cOur case has always been about Samsung\u2019s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\u2019t right.\u201dA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\u201dJustice Sotomayor\u2019s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. \u201cAn \u2018article\u2019 is just \u2018a particular thing,\u2019\u201d she wrote, citing two dictionaries. \u201cAnd \u2018manufacture\u2019 means \u2018the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man\u2019 and \u2018the articles so made.\u2019\u201cAn article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,\u201d she concluded. \u201cSo understood, the term \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.\u201dPatent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\u201cThe court basically punted,\u201d said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. \u201cIt seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to tell you what the right rule is.\u2019\u201dMr. Lemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How We Identified the D.N.C. Hack\u2019s \u2018Patient Zero\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byReporter's NotebookEpidemiologists, at the outbreak of any major disease, are sent out to the field to find patient zero \u2014 the first victim, which helps explain how the contagion began. As David Sanger, Scott Shane and I set out in late November to reconstruct the events surrounding the hacking of the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign, we too wanted to understand, among all factors, how and where this story started.But we had never taken the opportunity to look back and tell the story as a single, extended narrative, chronicling the people who got swept into one of the most famous hacks in history. Kitty Bennett, our news researcher extraordinaire, helped start the effort by building a chronology of events \u2014 based on as many primary source documents as we could find.We also reached out to WikiLeaks \u2014 and its editor in chief, Julian Assange \u2014 and tried, though without much success, to engage individuals in the Russian government, as well as Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, the Russian-linked websites that dumped many of the Democrats\u2019 emails and other documents.In each of these interviews, we asked the principal players not only to tell their stories, from start to finish, but also to provide us with primary source documents, such as emails or memos, even if they shared them on the condition that we could not reproduce them. Documents are better than human memory: They nail down names and days and times \u2014 some of the last captured emails offered windows into how various email accounts were cracked open \u2014 and sometimes give us a sense of contemporaneous reactions. The Democratic Party officials were surprisingly open to telling this story, as they almost all felt that the media had focused far too much on the content of the stolen emails themselves and not nearly enough on how the 2016 election had been disrupted by a Russian plot. The White House didn\u2019t want to discuss the topic.Kitty Bennett\u2019s original chronology grew in length, as we filled it in based on our interviews and collected documents, ultimately reaching more than 10,000 words: a 28-page compilation of people and events that served as the core of our narrative.It was while doing all these interviews that we first heard the story of Yared Tamene, the tech-services consultant at the D.N.C. who had fielded a call in September 2015 from an F.B.I. special agent named Adrian Hawkins \u2014 who contacted the D.N.C. to disclose that federal officials had evidence that the D.N.C. computer system had already been hacked. But Mr. Tamene did not believe he was talking to a real F.B.I. agent, so he didn\u2019t move definitively to find and shut down this intrusion.Even after Special Agent Hawkins repeatedly called Mr. Tamene and finally met with him in person last January, he remained skeptical, describing their encounter this way in an internal D.N.C. memo: \u201cDuring this meeting, SA Hawkins showed his FBI badge to us, and shared his business card, lending some credence to his claim about working for the FBI.\u201d This was five months after the F.B.I. had first contacted the D.N.C. But Special Agent Hawkins\u2019s superiors took no steps to independently reach out to the committee\u2019s leaders to persuade them to take seriously what appeared to be a Russian government attack. Between the passivity of the F.B.I. and the passivity of the D.N.C., almost no progress had been made to identify and lock out the hackers.Mr. Tamene never agreed to speak with us, although we happened to run into him during one of our visits to D.N.C. headquarters. But based on documents we reviewed \u2014 including an internal D.N.C. account of his dealings with the F.B.I. that Mr. Tamene himself had written \u2014 we were confident we had found our patient zero. Our story would start in September 2015, when this first warning call had come in from the FBI.When you do reporting like this, you begin to hear the same stories over and over again, told by different players who experienced the same events. These accounts might seem redundant. But for reporters, they\u2019re vital stuff, because each person fills in different tidbits \u2014 or pieces of color, as we call them. These overlapping stories help increase your confidence that the version of events you\u2019re piecing together is fair and true, particularly when backed up with emails and other documents.While David worked, Scott Shane, one of the top intelligence reporters in Washington, focused on the F.B.I. and on a group we called \u201cthe facilitators,\u201d which included players like WikiLeaks that posted the hacked emails in a public place. He also spent a large chunk of time examining the evidence investigators had gathered as proof that the Russian state was involved in the hack \u2014 we went into this project determined to evaluate it on our own rather than base our work on an assumption that this was Russian espionage.What is often most fascinating when you do so-called narrative reconstructs like this is how seemingly minor events can in retrospect have such enormous consequences. Consider the case of Charles Delavan, an aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, who in March 2016 was forwarded the phishing email that had been sent to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. Mr. Delavan had been asked to advise Mr. Podesta if this was a real email from Google, asking him to change the password on his personal Gmail account, or a hoax, trying to hack into Mr. Podesta\u2019s account.The Clinton campaign, simultaneously, was the target of an aggressive cyberattack that relied in large part on near replicas of this same fake Google email, urging recipients to change their password. So Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said he immediately knew this was a fake. And to me, as a reporter, that was a plausible statement.The mistake, Mr. Delavan said in the interview, is \u201cthe worst thing that ever happened in my life.\u201d He has become a target of threats via Twitter, email and telephone, with one person even coming to his house in Brooklyn before the election to tell him, \u201cYou are going to make us lose the election.\u201d It is a burden he will carry with him for the rest of his life.As we moved toward wrapping up our reporting, the history almost overtook us.The doorstopper-size history books we read make it seem like much of what happens as the pages turn is a matter of fate. It all had to happen that way, right? My impression is quite different. History, as this story once again illustrates, is marked by a lot of happenstance \u2014 small but consequential acts that ricochet out into the world, writing the narrative in real time as the events unfold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Presses American Tech Companies to Tackle Hate Speech", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byEuropean officials pushed on Tuesday for American technology giants to do more to tackle online hate speech across the region, adding to the chorus of policy makers worldwide demanding greater action from the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter.Amid growing security tensions in much of the Western world, governments, intelligence agencies and advocacy groups want Google, Microsoft and other technology companies to take further steps to curb hate speech on digital platforms, as well as to clamp down on how terrorists circulate information online.But freedom of expression campaigners have warned that such demands may limit people\u2019s ability to communicate across the internet, and they have cautioned that the line between hate speech and legitimate political discussion can be blurry.Press officers for Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for Facebook and Twitter were not immediately available to comment.In a recent interview, Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said that the social network was committed to tackling hate speech online, but that there was a fine line between what was legitimate under freedom of speech laws and what was required to protect people online.\u201cOur policies provide protection from hate speech,\u201d Mr. Allan said last month. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t apply media regulation to the speech of ordinary citizens.\u201dSome lawmakers, though, are not satisfied.Heiko Maas, the German justice minister, has said that Facebook could even be held criminally liable for illegal hate speech posts, and he has called for legislation if the company does not meet its legal commitments.\u201cFacebook has a certain responsibility to uphold the laws,\u201d Mr. Maas said.The social network denies any wrongdoing.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Richard Allen. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Officials Accuse Facebook of Misleading Them on WhatsApp Deal", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byThe accusation, which could lead to a fine of up to 1 percent of Facebook\u2019s yearly revenue, meaning a penalty of about $200 million, comes amid growing tension with Europe\u2019s policy makers over how the company is able to dominate much of the region\u2019s digital world.The company denies all of the allegations, but says it is doing more to remove fake news articles and posts that promote hate speech.On Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, said Facebook had misled regulators in 2014 when it bought WhatsApp. She said the company did not outline its plans to match people\u2019s Facebook accounts with those on the popular messaging app, which now has more than a billion users worldwide.Yet Ms. Vestager said the potential of such linking was not explained when the social network sought regulatory approval for the purchase, despite questioning from European officials.By subsequently adding the data sharing to its wider digital offerings, she said, Facebook misled officials, since the company already had the ability to match people\u2019s accounts when the takeover was first announced.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook said that it had acted in good faith when seeking approval of the deal from European regulators, and that the company had contacted the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, at the start of this year about its new plans to match people\u2019s accounts.\u201cWe respect the commission\u2019s process,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman, Sally Aldous, said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate and share information officials need to resolve their questions.\u201dFacebook has until the end of next month to respond to the European competition charges and there is no fixed deadline for the authorities in Brussels to make a decision in the case. Any legal appeal against the potential ruling could take years to resolve.Twelve years ago, the commission raised the maximum allowable fine to the current level of 1 percent of annual revenue to dissuade companies from misleading regulators during mergers.Despite having brought similar cases against other companies, the commission has never imposed the potentially higher fines. The previous record in such a case dates to 1999, when the commission fined the German postal operator Deutsche Post 100,000 euros, or about $105,000 at current exchange rates, for two offenses. At the time, the maximum fine for each offense was \u20ac50,000.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Despite the new regulatory standoff, Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp is not in question. Any European decision against Facebook would not restrict the increasing dominance that the social network and WhatsApp have over how people in the Western world communicate.Facebook\u2019s plans to link WhatsApp to its increasingly powerful online advertising business model have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe, which has some of the toughest privacy and competition rules.The company still shares people\u2019s digital information in the United States and elsewhere, although privacy campaigners have filed legal challenges with the Federal Trade Commission.European policy makers say that they are protecting the region\u2019s 500 million people from potential harmful acts by these dominant American companies, though industry executives have often accused the region\u2019s lawmakers of unfairly targeting Silicon Valley giants to promote European rivals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worried About the Privacy of Your Messages? Download Signal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byTech FixBY the time you finish reading this column, you would be foolish not to download the messaging app Signal onto your smartphone and computer.The free encrypted messaging service has won the acclaim of security researchers and privacy advocates, including Edward J. Snowden. All have said that Signal goes above and beyond other chat tools in keeping electronic communications private.Signal is one of many encrypted messaging services, but it stands out for its uncompromising security and ease of use. The chat service retains virtually no information from users, including messages and address books, on its servers. What\u2019s more, messages remain encrypted when passing through Signal\u2019s servers, meaning that the app\u2019s creators can\u2019t read them.Some people have already cottoned on to this. Signal experienced a 400 percent jump in daily downloads since Mr. Trump won the election, according to Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Open Whisper Systems, the nonprofit that developed Signal. To Mr. Marlinspike, the surge in downloads reflects anxiety among Americans about the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency for personal privacy.\u201cTrump has threatened a lot of people and he\u2019s about to be in control of the most pervasive and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cA lot of people are justifiably concerned about that.\u201dSignal offers end-to-end encryption, meaning a message is scrambled so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient when it is sent from your device, and it remains so when it passes through the app\u2019s server and reaches the recipient.When you initiate a conversation with someone on Signal, you and the recipient exchange so-called cryptographic keys. Only the person who receives your message holds the key to decrypt and read it. That means that if a government agency had a wiretapping order for your Signal messages, Open Whisper Systems would not have the key to decipher the messages and would be unable to comply.Signal\u2019s technology sets the standard for other messaging services, with its protocol being an open-source system that other companies can freely use. WhatsApp, Facebook\u2019s Messenger and Google embedded Signal\u2019s encrypted messaging system into their own apps this year.Even so, security researchers said they preferred Signal over other messaging apps because it was more thorough in protecting users\u2019 privacy. The only information Signal stores about users in its database is the last time someone connected to its server and when a person signed up for Signal. Other messaging apps maintain pieces of personal data on their servers.Even though Signal doesn\u2019t record your information, the app still works across devices, like a desktop computer and a mobile device. Messages and contacts\u2019 data are stored directly on users\u2019 devices and synchronized between them.Let\u2019s say you already use Signal on your iPhone and want to use it to chat on a Mac (Signal is available as a web app for Google\u2019s Chrome browser for desktop computers). To link the desktop app with your iPhone, you would use the iPhone\u2019s camera to scan a bar code on the Mac web app, which links the two devices together. Then, to get your contacts list and conversations to appear on the Mac, the Mac app pulls your contacts list and messages directly from the iPhone via an encrypted channel, according to Mr. Marlinspike.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more work, from our perspective,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than storing all this stuff on a server.\u201dSignal occasionally runs into glitches, such as when it comes to synchronizing data between computers and smartphones. In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app \u2014 though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later.Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service.Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time; I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad. Mr. Marlinspike said it would support multiple mobile devices eventually.Still, this is a trivial issue. I\u2019d choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day.Another benefit is that Open Whisper Systems is a nonprofit that relies on donations and grants, not a business that might eventually have an incentive to share your information with third parties like advertisers.That\u2019s not to say Signal should be your only messaging app. You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters, like work-related conversations. Then for casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones, you could switch to more \u201cfun\u201d apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want.Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends. The app isn\u2019t as popular among consumers as other mainstream messaging apps, so hanging out on Signal can feel lonely. So if you care about your privacy, other than installing Signal today, you should nag everyone you know to join the service, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Mounts Effort to Limit Tide of Fake News", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byFor weeks, Facebook has been questioned about its role in spreading fake news. Now the company has mounted its most concerted effort to combat the problem.Facebook, the social network, is in a tricky position with these tests. It has long regarded itself as a neutral place where people can freely post, read and view content, and it has said it does not want to be an arbiter of truth. But as its reach and influence have grown, it has had to confront questions about its moral obligations and ethical standards regarding what appears on the network.Its experiments on curtailing fake news show that Facebook recognizes it has a deepening responsibility for what is on its site. But Facebook also must tread cautiously in making changes, because it is wary of exposing itself to claims of censorship.\u201cWe really value giving people a voice, but we also believe we need to take responsibility for the spread of fake news on our platform,\u201d said Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who is in charge of its news feed, the company\u2019s method of distributing information to its global audience.He said the changes \u2014 which, if successful, may be available to a wide audience \u2014 resulted from many months of internal discussion about how to handle false news articles shared on the network.Still, Facebook has taken the most heat over fake news. The company has been under that spotlight since Nov. 8, when Donald J. Trump was elected the 45th president. Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory almost immediately led people to focus on whether Facebook had influenced the electorate, especially with the rise of hyperpartisan sites on the network and many examples of misinformation, such as a false article that claimed Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump for president that was shared nearly a million times across the site.In an interview, Mr. Mosseri said Facebook did not think its news feed had directly caused people to vote for a particular candidate, given that \u201cthe magnitude of fake news across Facebook is one fraction of a percent of the content across the network.\u201dThis time, Facebook is making it easier to flag content that may be fake. Users can report a post they dislike in their feed, but when Facebook asks for a reason, the site presents them with a list of limited and vague options, including the cryptic \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be on Facebook.\u201d In Facebook\u2019s new experiment, users will have a choice to flag the post as fake news and have the option to message the friend who originally shared the piece to tell him or her the article is false.If an article receives enough flags as fake, it can be directed to a coalition of groups that will fact-check it. The groups include Snopes, PolitiFact, The Associated Press, FactCheck.org and ABC News. They will check the article and can mark it as a \u201cdisputed\u201d piece, a designation that will be seen on Facebook.Partner organizations will not be paid, the companies said. Some characterized the fact-checking as an extension of their journalistic efforts.\u201cWe actually regard this as a big part of our core mission,\u201d James Goldston, the president of ABC News, said in an interview. \u201cIf that core mission isn\u2019t helping people regard the real from the fake news, I don\u2019t know what our mission is.\u201dDisputed articles will ultimately appear lower in the news feed. If users still decide to share such an article, they will receive a pop-up reminding them that the accuracy of the piece is in question.Facebook said it was casting a wide net to add more partners to its fact-checking coalition and may move outside of the United States with the initiative if early experiments go well. The company is also part of the First Draft Coalition, an effort with other technology and media companies including Twitter, Google, The New York Times and CNN, to combat the spread of fake news online.In another change in how the news feed works, articles that many users read but do not share will be ranked lower on people\u2019s feeds. Mr. Mosseri said a low ratio of sharing an article after it has been read could be perceived as a negative signal, one that might reflect that the article was misleading or of poor quality.\u201cFacebook was inevitably going to have to curate the platform much more carefully, and this seems like a reasonably transparent method of intervention,\u201d said Emily Bell, director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.\u201cBut the fake cat is already out of the imaginary bag,\u201d Ms. Bell added. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t try and do something about it, next time around it could have far worse consequences.\u201dFacebook also plans to impede the economics of spreading fake articles across the network. Fake news purveyors generally make money when people click on the false articles and are directed to third-party websites, the majority of which are filled with dozens of low-cost ads.Facebook will review those third-party links and check for things like whether the page is mostly filled with advertising content \u2014 a dead giveaway for spam sites \u2014 or to see whether a link masquerades as a different site, like a fake version of The New York Times. Such sites would not be eligible to display Facebook advertising on their pages.Articles disputed by the fact-checking coalition will also not be eligible to be inserted into Facebook ads, a tactic viral spammers have used to spread fake news quickly and gain more clicks on their websites.Facebook said that in these early experiments it would deal with only fake news content; it does not plan to flag opinion posts or other content that could not be easily classified. The changes will not affect satirical sites like The Onion, which often jabs at political subjects through tongue-in-cheek humor.Executives at Facebook stressed the overriding factor right now is not just engagement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do We Know?", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThe secret to happiness in almost any relationship is knowing what not to say. Ask your new love about her old loves and you\u2019ll learn more than you want to know, and hear things you\u2019ll never be able to unhear. Start telling your teacher that your dog ate your homework while your grandma was being rushed to the hospital, and he\u2019ll have even less patience with you than if you just say, \u201cI blew it.\u201dOne reason we\u2019re advised to send only brief emails is that too much information gives the person at the other end much more to misinterpret \u2014 or to start chewing over at 3 a.m. The other is that if you send a long message, the person you\u2019re writing to may feel compelled to send an equally long one back, and then it\u2019s you who\u2019s twisting and turning on what she meant by that \u201cand\u201d and why she never mentioned Steve.Or why she never wrote back at all.We have, of course, been aware of this danger since the beginning of time, and yet we\u2019ve never been in a position to devour (or deliver) as much information as we are today, in the age of 24/7 news cycles and social media. We\u2019ve never been so tempted, therefore, to forget that the pool of knowledge is limited; it\u2019s the pool of ignorance, speculation and misunderstanding that is infinite.As we look back on our season of surprises \u2014 from Bob Dylan\u2019s Nobel Prize to Donald Trump\u2019s election \u2014 what we\u2019re being reminded of, surely, is how very little we know. On Nov. 7, thanks to more data than had ever been collected before, updated every second for 16 months or more, we all knew what was coming. By midnight the following day, we realized that all the data in the world doesn\u2019t add up to real life.Remember in \u201cOthello\u201d how the seasoned warrior is coaxed away from the realm of knowledge and into the adjacent territories of inference and rumor, by his old friend Iago? The minute he is severed from real life, on the \u201crack\u201d of his own thoughts, declaring \u201cIago is most honest\u201d after Iago has confided to us, \u201cI am not what I am,\u201d the noble Moor can\u2019t be sure of a thing. Our pollsters, our pundits, our sources of \u201cnews\u201d \u2014 our know-it-all selves \u2014 work much the same ground, though perhaps with less malicious intent, to persuade us that hearsay + opinion + guesswork = truth.I recently got a crash course in this reality \u2014 don\u2019t we all nowadays, on dates or job interviews, on simple social occasions? \u2014 when I visited a campus. I was told that Professor X was going to host me for dinner, so of course I decided to check him out online, not least because I was fairly sure Professor X would do the same with me. I needed to show him I had thought about him beforehand; more than that, I had to be armed for two hours of small talk.As soon as I googled him, RateMyTeachers.com came up, and I learned that my host-to-be was arrogant, ignorant, cruel and even sadistic. Each entry was more vicious than the last. Only later did I wonder whether this character assassination was a conspiracy among the few students to whom he\u2019d given a \u201cC.\u201d I didn\u2019t stop to think that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily trust these 19-year-olds in any other domain, least of all when their futures were at stake. I didn\u2019t bother to consider that it\u2019s usually those who are most vehemently pursuing an agenda who take the time and trouble to post reviews online.I went into my host\u2019s house on guard \u2014 and hardly knew what to do with the kindly, courteous and really fun man who stood in front of me. He no doubt wondered why I was being so standoffish and reserved. Or maybe he\u2019d come across reviews of me online and knew already that I\u2019m arrogant, ignorant and cruel.Greater access to knowledge is one of the glories of our age. Even many of our most materially deprived neighbors have the Library of Alexandria, multiplied by a factor of roughly infinity, in the palm of their hands, as no generation before ours has had. The amount of data in our control is part of what has made our lives richer and happier than ever before. On a trip to North Korea two years ago, after many years away, I recalled, with a shock, what it is to be in a sealed, predigital universe in which you can know only what you\u2019re permitted to know.Walking around the Potemkin monuments of Pyongyang, I had to recall to myself that the glittery, ultramodern skyscrapers around me were often stage sets, with nothing but ghosts on many floors; the woman in the gleaming subway car who offered a friendly hello in English might well have been ordered to do so by her government, a human prop. The moment I returned to what I regard as Planet Earth, I went online, and rejoiced to come upon what felt like almost universally acknowledged truths.But one thing that happens when we acquire too much \u201cknowledge\u201d is that, like Othello, we sometimes fail to distinguish it from what can never be known, which may not be untrue. Another is that we\u2019re tempted to lose sight of the distinction between those realms, like science and health, where the more data we have, the better, and others, like human relations, where the opposite may be true.Knowledge comes to seem an end in itself, and then we gobble it down and gobble it down without stopping to realize that it\u2019s Iago \u2014 or that anonymous writer of the Wikipedia entry \u2014 who\u2019s serving it up to us, and that wisdom sometimes depends on seeing how much knowledge doesn\u2019t know and how much every day is shaped by unexpectedness.As a boy I was aware that knowledge was the coolest form of power around; nearly every adolescent wants to be in the know. What I couldn\u2019t see was that it\u2019s precisely in matters of highest importance \u2014 love, terror, is there a God, and why is Iago possessed by the Devil? \u2014 that we\u2019re outside the domain of knowledge. That the more information we gather, on anyone from Angelina Jolie to Donald Trump, the less we seem to know. And that nobody trustworthy wishes to run for public office now, in part because, in the age of knowledge, no one is unstained before the global jury of the internet.Anyone reading this essay will accumulate more knowledge today than Shakespeare did in his entire lifetime. But Shakespeare knew much that it\u2019s harder for us to see. As my friends keep telling me what\u2019s going to happen during the Trump presidency, I remember everything they were telling me eight years ago about how President Obama was going to change the world. Thank heavens President Obama was wise enough sometimes to point out that none of us even knows what\u2019s going to happen tonight.Pico Iyer, a distinguished presidential fellow at Chapman University, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Man Within My Head\u201d and \u201cThe Art of Stillness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great A.I. Awakening", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "FeatureHow Google used artificial intelligence to transform Google Translate, one of its more popular services \u2014 and how machine learning is poised to reinvent computing itself.Supported byLate one Friday night in early November, Jun Rekimoto, a distinguished professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Tokyo, was online preparing for a lecture when he began to notice some peculiar posts rolling in on social media. Apparently Google Translate, the company\u2019s popular machine-translation service, had suddenly and almost immeasurably improved. Rekimoto visited Translate himself and began to experiment with it. He was astonished. He had to go to sleep, but Translate refused to relax its grip on his imagination.Rekimoto wrote up his initial findings in a blog post. First, he compared a few sentences from two published versions of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Takashi Nozaki\u2019s 1957 translation and Haruki Murakami\u2019s more recent iteration, with what this new Google Translate was able to produce. Murakami\u2019s translation is written \u201cin very polished Japanese,\u201d Rekimoto explained to me later via email, but the prose is distinctively \u201cMurakami-style.\u201d By contrast, Google\u2019s translation \u2014 despite some \u201csmall unnaturalness\u201d \u2014 reads to him as \u201cmore transparent.\u201dThe second half of Rekimoto\u2019s post examined the service in the other direction, from Japanese to English. He dashed off his own Japanese interpretation of the opening to Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,\u201d then ran that passage back through Google into English. He published this version alongside Hemingway\u2019s original, and proceeded to invite his readers to guess which was the work of a machine.NO. 1:Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai \u201cNgaje Ngai,\u201d the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.NO. 2:Kilimanjaro is a mountain of 19,710 feet covered with snow and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. The summit of the west is called \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in Masai, the house of God. Near the top of the west there is a dry and frozen dead body of leopard. No one has ever explained what leopard wanted at that altitude.Even to a native English speaker, the missing article on the leopard is the only real giveaway that No. 2 was the output of an automaton. Their closeness was a source of wonder to Rekimoto, who was well acquainted with the capabilities of the previous service. Only 24 hours earlier, Google would have translated the same Japanese passage as follows:Kilimanjaro is 19,710 feet of the mountain covered with snow, and it is said that the highest mountain in Africa. Top of the west, \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in the Maasai language, has been referred to as the house of God. The top close to the west, there is a dry, frozen carcass of a leopard. Whether the leopard had what the demand at that altitude, there is no that nobody explained.Rekimoto promoted his discovery to his hundred thousand or so followers on Twitter, and over the next few hours thousands of people broadcast their own experiments with the machine-translation service. Some were successful, others meant mostly for comic effect. As dawn broke over Tokyo, Google Translate was the No. 1 trend on Japanese Twitter, just above some cult anime series and the long-awaited new single from a girl-idol supergroup. Everybody wondered: How had Google Translate become so uncannily artful?Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, stood to make a few opening remarks. A friend, he began, had recently told him he reminded him of Google. \u201cWhy, because I know all the answers?\u201d the mayor asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the friend replied, \u201cbecause you\u2019re always trying to finish my sentences.\u201d The crowd tittered politely. Khan concluded by introducing Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who took the stage.Pichai was in London in part to inaugurate Google\u2019s new building there, the cornerstone of a new \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d under construction at King\u2019s Cross, and in part to unveil the completion of the initial phase of a company transformation he announced last year. The Google of the future, Pichai had said on several occasions, was going to be \u201cA.I. first.\u201d What that meant in theory was complicated and had welcomed much speculation. What it meant in practice, with any luck, was that soon the company\u2019s products would no longer represent the fruits of traditional computer programming, exactly, but \u201cmachine learning.\u201dA rarefied department within the company, Google Brain, was founded five years ago on this very principle: that artificial \u201cneural networks\u201d that acquaint themselves with the world via trial and error, as toddlers do, might in turn develop something like human flexibility. This notion is not new \u2014 a version of it dates to the earliest stages of modern computing, in the 1940s \u2014 but for much of its history most computer scientists saw it as vaguely disreputable, even mystical. Since 2011, though, Google Brain has demonstrated that this approach to artificial intelligence could solve many problems that confounded decades of conventional efforts. Speech recognition didn\u2019t work very well until Brain undertook an effort to revamp it; the application of machine learning made its performance on Google\u2019s mobile platform, Android, almost as good as human transcription. The same was true of image recognition. Less than a year ago, Brain for the first time commenced with the gut renovation of an entire consumer product, and its momentous results were being celebrated tonight.Translate made its debut in 2006 and since then has become one of Google\u2019s most reliable and popular assets; it serves more than 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day in a different language. It exists not only as its own stand-alone app but also as an integrated feature within Gmail, Chrome and many other Google offerings, where we take it as a push-button given \u2014 a frictionless, natural part of our digital commerce. It was only with the refugee crisis, Pichai explained from the lectern, that the company came to reckon with Translate\u2019s geopolitical importance: On the screen behind him appeared a graph whose steep curve indicated a recent fivefold increase in translations between Arabic and German. (It was also close to Pichai\u2019s own heart. He grew up in India, a land divided by dozens of languages.) The team had been steadily adding new languages and features, but gains in quality over the last four years had slowed considerably.Until today. As of the previous weekend, Translate had been converted to an A.I.-based system for much of its traffic, not just in the United States but in Europe and Asia as well: The rollout included translations between English and Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. The rest of Translate\u2019s hundred-odd languages were to come, with the aim of eight per month, by the end of next year. The new incarnation, to the pleasant surprise of Google\u2019s own engineers, had been completed in only nine months. The A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime.Grinning, Pichai read aloud an awkward English version of the sentence that had been rendered by the old Translate system: \u201cOne is not what is for what he writes, but for what he has read.\u201dTo the right of that was a new A.I.-rendered version: \u201cYou are not what you write, but what you have read.\u201dIt was a fitting remark: The new Google Translate was run on the first machines that had, in a sense, ever learned to read anything at all.The phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is invoked as if its meaning were self-evident, but it has always been a source of confusion and controversy. Imagine if you went back to the 1970s, stopped someone on the street, pulled out a smartphone and showed her Google Maps. Once you managed to convince her you weren\u2019t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\u2019t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \u2014 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \u201cA.I.,\u201d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d are thus constantly receding.The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Facebook\u2019s M, Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\u2019t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer. Management consultants are falling all over themselves to prep executives for the widening industrial applications of computers that program themselves. DeepMind, a 2014 Google acquisition, defeated the reigning human grandmaster of the ancient board game Go, despite predictions that such an achievement would take another 10 years.It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\u2019s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \u2014 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \u2014 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \u2014 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\u2019s \u201cmicrokitchens\u201d \u2014 the \u201cGoogley\u201d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\u2019s buildings \u2014 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \u201cneural networks,\u201d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\u2019s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\u2019s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \u201c20 percent\u201d \u2014 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \u2014 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \u201cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\u201d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\u2019s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\u2019s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\u2019s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \u201cminister of agriculture\u201d as \u201cpriest of farming.\u201d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d better than math and chess.There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\u2019t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.There has always been another vision for A.I. \u2014 a dissenting view \u2014 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\u2019t. What\u2019s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\u2019t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \u2014 sensory perception and motor control \u2014 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\u2019t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \u2014 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 and drew upon both the company\u2019s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \u2014 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.\u201cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\u201d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \u201cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\u2019ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\u201d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\u2019s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \u201cType in your LDAP\u201d \u2014 a user login \u2014 and he would flag a helper to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s an LDAP?\u201d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \u201cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\u2019t he get it?\u201d\u201cAt lunchtime,\u201d Hinton said, \u201csomeone in the queue yelled: \u2018Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\u2019 After that, it was all right.\u201dHinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\u2019s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \u201cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\u201dHinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\u2019s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \u201cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\u2019d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \u2014 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \u2014 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.The issue with multilayered, \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\u2019s easy. Imagine that you\u2019re playing with a child. You tell the child, \u201cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\u201d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \u201cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\u201d The child tries Box A. Bravo.These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \u201cconnectionism\u201d or \u201cparallel distributed processing.\u201d \u201cThis idea,\u201d Hinton told me, \u201cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\u2019s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\u2019\u2009It wasn\u2019t a very persuasive argument.\u201dTo understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\u2019re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\u2019t how they work. All they\u2019re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \u2014 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \u2014 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\u2019re feeding them is biased in the first place.If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \u201ccat.\u201d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \u201cNot cat.\u201d It is hyperliteral, or \u201cbrittle.\u201d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \u201cvoters,\u201d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \u201cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\u201d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \u201cA dog?\u201dYou say: \u201cNo, maestro, it\u2019s a cat. Try again.\u201dNow the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \u201ccat\u201d and which didn\u2019t. The ones that got \u201ccat\u201d right get their votes counted double next time \u2014 at least when they\u2019re voting for \u201ccat.\u201d They have to prove independently whether they\u2019re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\u2019s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\u2019s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\u2019s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\u2019s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \u201cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \u2018cats.\u2019\u2009\u201d The more \u201cvoters\u201d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \u2014 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\u2019s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\u2019s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \u201cdumbbell\u201d but the concept of \u201cdumbbell+arm,\u201d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\u2019s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\u2019s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?\u201cBut actually,\u201d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \u201cit\u2019s very hard.\u201d\u201cThere was a big debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cA very big debate.\u201d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\u2019d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a big debate.\u201dHe remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \u201cThis is the future.\u201d It was, he said, an \u201cunpopular decision at the time.\u201d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\u2019t quite understand Le\u2019s decision. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked Le in an email.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good answer back then,\u201d Le said. \u201cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\u201d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\u2019s ideas. \u201cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\u201dWhat happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \u2014 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\u2019t specify what it should or shouldn\u2019t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \u201cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\u201d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \u201csummarize\u201d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \u2014 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \u2014 the machine couldn\u2019t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\u2019s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \u201cchose\u201d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\u2019t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.Le didn\u2019t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\u2019t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\u2019s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\u2019s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\u2019t help myself and began to ask, \u201cIs he ... ?\u201d Le nodded. \u201cAt Facebook,\u201d he replied.)The hundred or so current members of Brain \u2014 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \u2014 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\u2019s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)When I began spending time at Brain\u2019s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \u201cJesse, 6/27.\u201d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.Brain\u2019s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \u201csuccess disaster\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the company\u2019s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.\u201cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis is how many machines we\u2019ll need.\u201d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.\u201cThat,\u201d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \u201csounded scary. You\u2019d have to\u201d \u2014 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \u2014 \u201cbuild new buildings.\u201dThere was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \u201ctensor processing units,\u201d and their value proposition \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\u2019s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \u201cNormally,\u201d Dean said, \u201cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\u201dLe\u2019s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \u2014 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\u2019s model didn\u2019t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\u2019t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \u201cYou think,\u201d Schuster says, \u201cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\u2019re done, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201dThe issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\u2019s code was custom-written, and it wasn\u2019t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\u2019s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\u2019t always make heads or tails of what they had done.As Schuster put it, \u201cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\u2019t know themselves why they worked.\u201dThis February, Google\u2019s research organization \u2014 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \u2014 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\u2019s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \u201clightning talks,\u201d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \u201cfacilitated discussions.\u201d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \u201cWe ambushed him.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \u201cWe have something to tell you.\u201dThey told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \u2014 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \u2014 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \u201cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\u201d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\u2019t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\u2019s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\u2019s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \u2014 and something akin to meaning.Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \u2014 not in a lab but at production scale \u2014 for years, to little avail.Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.Dean thought otherwise. \u201cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\u201d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \u201cif we put our minds to it.\u201dHughes was sure the conversion wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\u2019t personally care to be the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s prepare for 2016,\u201d he went back and told his team. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\u2019t deliver speed.\u201dA month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\u2019s new system with Hughes\u2019s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \u201cEnglish-French,\u201d he said, \u201cis so good that the improvement won\u2019t be obvious.\u201dIt was a challenge Schuster couldn\u2019t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.Hughes told Schuster\u2019s team they hadn\u2019t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.To be sure this wasn\u2019t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \u2014 Schuster, Wu and Chen \u2014 but with Hughes\u2019s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\u2019s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\u2019s case there was no ambiguity.The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \u201cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\u201d Schuster told me at one point. \u201cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\u201d \u2014 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \u2014 \u201cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\u201d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\u2019s there.\u201dMost of Google\u2019s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.\u201cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\u201dThe theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \u2014 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \u201cmere\u201d engineering \u2014 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\u2019s billions of words of training \u201creading\u201d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \u201cwords.\u201d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\u2019t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \u201cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\u2019s like a toddler. \u2018Oh, Daddy says that word when he\u2019s mad!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201dMore than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\u2019t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\u2019t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\u2019t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\u2019t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\u2019s service.Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\u2019t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t know to make it fast enough, but I don\u2019t know what it could be.\u201dHe did know, though, that they needed more computers \u2014 \u201cG.P.U.s,\u201d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \u2014 for training.Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \u201cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\u201dSchuster said, \u201cWhy not 2,000?\u201dTen days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \u2014 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \u201cPeople were almost yelling,\u201d Schuster said.By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \u201cword-piece model,\u201d a \u201ccoverage penalty,\u201d \u201clength normalization.\u201d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \u2014 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \u2014 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?\u201cWe did hundreds of experiments,\u201d Schuster told me, \u201cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\u2019re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\u2019m done? You never know you\u2019re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\u2019s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\u2019s hard for some people. It\u2019s a little bit an art \u2014 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\u201dThe Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \u201cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \u2018Oh, I did something first,\u2019 but who cares, in the end?\u201dThis did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\u2019t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a new system yet,\u201d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \u201cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\u2019s exploding on Twitter: \u2018Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.Google\u2019s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\u2019s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\u2019s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \u201cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\u201d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \u2014 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \u201ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\u201dTheir neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \u201cstep function forward\u201d \u2014 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.\u201cTo communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand cooperation!\u201dThe engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \u201cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\u201dEveryone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\u2019t.Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\u2019s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \u201cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\u201d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \u201cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\u201dFor the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\u2019t assume that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \u2014 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\u2019re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\u2019s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a machine \u2018knows\u2019 or \u2018understands\u2019 but what it \u2018does,\u2019 and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 what it doesn\u2019t do yet.\u201dWhere you come down on \u201cknowing\u201d versus \u201cdoing\u201d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\u2019s media reception. \u201cDid you see the first press?\u201d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\u2019. Over the final weeks of the paper\u2019s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\u201d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\u2019t about replacing people but helping them.And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \u201cinsight,\u201d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\u2019s antagonists, you can\u2019t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\u2019t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s causing the cancer.Then again, can the radiologist?Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \u2014 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\u2019re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\u2019re just telling you it\u2019s there.Once you\u2019ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \u2014 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \u2014 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \u2014 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\u2019re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\u2019re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\u2019s institution-building \u2014 and the consolidation of power \u2014 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \u201cninja\u201d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \u2014 for they\u2019re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \u2014 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \u2014 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\u2019s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, \u201cSo when do we get to delete it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe new code base is going to grow. Everything grows.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a computer used in space travel. A computer was used to guide Apollo missions \u2014 not the \u201cApollo shuttle.\u201d (There was no such shuttle.)Advertisement"}

That was slightly more retweets than Mr. Trump got this year on an early-morning tweet after winning the election.Last on the list was a tweet that found resonance among Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son Chases First Place With Tech Deals", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Masayoshi Son is a Japanese billionaire who wants to control the way your car talks to street lamps.The 59-year-old technology investor \u2014 a grandson of South Korean immigrants who has amassed one of Japan\u2019s largest personal fortunes by pursuing grand, Silicon Valley-inspired visions \u2014 is best known outside his homeland for buying the American mobile phone carrier Sprint for $21.6 billion in 2013.His goal is nothing less than to change how the material world works \u2014 and to turn his company, the SoftBank Group, into the future\u2019s most important technology business. Specifically, he is planning for a day when millions of everyday objects run on chips and tiny computers that talk to one another \u2014 allowing street lamps, for example, to save power by switching themselves off when cars are not around.The bets are risky. SoftBank is buying ARM for a rich $32 billion, and it plans to plow another $25 billion in the Saudi joint venture over the next five years. Neither guarantees that SoftBank will stay globally relevant in a fast-changing digital world.Mr. Son\u2019s track record includes big victories, like an early investment in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. But his deal for Sprint has so far resulted mostly in red ink. And his ambitions led to the departure of his handpicked successor, leaving questions over who will oversee SoftBank\u2019s future.\u201cSon acts on instinct,\u201d said Satoshi Shima, a former senior lieutenant to Mr. Son who is now a professor at Tama University. \u201cIt\u2019s a genius instinct, but it\u2019s not logic.\u201dThe ARM purchase is crucial to Mr. Son\u2019s ambitions. The British company aims to wire up self-driving cars, internet-enabled home appliances, medical devices and even clothing.\u201cSoftBank has had a lot of businesses, but they\u2019ve always ranked, say, third in Japan, or fourth in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Son said in July after announcing the ARM deal. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re directly controlling a business that is No. 1 in the world.\u201dWith a $14.9 billion personal fortune, Mr. Son is ranked by Forbes as Japan\u2019s second-richest man, behind Tadashi Yanai, the owner of Fast Retailing and its Uniqlo brand. But he spent his early life in poverty: His father started out as a bootlegger and small-time pig farmer before finding success in restaurants and pachinko, the Japanese offshoot of pinball. By the time he was a teenager, his family was wealthy enough that he was able to travel to the United States for college, eventually ending up at the University of California, Berkeley.Mr. Son founded SoftBank in 1981 as a distributor of computer software. For start-up money, he has told biographers, he sold a prototype electronic translation machine to Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, for about $1 million. Mr. Son, who trained in economics, not engineering, came up with the general idea for the machine while still in college, then recruited others to create it \u2014 an approach he has followed throughout his career.Takenobu Miki worked closely with Mr. Son for eight years before leaving SoftBank in 2006 to found an online language-training start-up. Initially, he was the only full-time employee at SoftBank, which, despite sounding like a tech start-up, operated \u201clike an investment fund, with a portfolio of holdings that Son would adjust based on changing growth rates,\u201d Mr. Miki said.One item in the portfolio was Yahoo, an early investment that earned Mr. Son a fortune. The investment displayed Mr. Son\u2019s willingness to act on a general conviction: in this case, that web portals would be crucial to the early commercial development of the internet. He did relatively little research on Yahoo itself, Mr. Miki recalled. \u201cHe asked some contacts in Silicon Valley which was the best web portal, and they said Yahoo. So he bought.\u201dMr. Miki also remembers working with Mr. Son to create a growth projection for SoftBank that extended 300 years into the future.\u201cThe goal was to become a 100 trillion-yen company,\u201d Mr. Miki said, an amount equal to about $1 trillion. \u201cEven at that time, Son wanted to become No. 1 in the world.\u201dSoftBank declined to make Mr. Son available for an interview for this article.Mr. Son revels in confrontation, a trait that sets him apart in harmony-obsessed Japan. Twice, he has threatened to set fire to himself or the offices of Japanese telecommunications regulators \u2014 the first time in a dispute over access to fiber-optic cable, the second in a fight over internet censorship. He apologized in the second instance, in 2010, calling the threat an inappropriate joke.In 2013, he apologized again at a news conference after he became involved in a shouting match with government officials over plans to allocate cellular spectrum to KDDI, a SoftBank rival. \u201cI thought I had grown up,\u201d he said.Mr. Son has made bold, expensive acquisitions before. In 2006, he borrowed heavily to buy the Japanese arm of Vodafone, the British cellphone carrier, which was badly lagging two Japanese rivals. He tore up the company\u2019s pricing strategy, using discounts to undercut the industry\u2019s cozy near duopoly, then negotiated exclusive rights to carry Apple\u2019s iPhone. Subscriber numbers and profits soared.Hoping to repeat his success in the United States, SoftBank spent $21.6 billion to acquire Sprint in 2013. But there were no exclusive iPhone deals to be had, and American officials blocked a plan by Mr. Son to buy another carrier, T-Mobile, which would have given the business more scale. Sprint has hemorrhaged money \u2014 it lost $302 million last quarter \u2014 though lately its subscriber base has been expanding.SoftBank\u2019s deal with Saudi Arabia will give Mr. Son even more money to play with, though it could also make future investments more complicated because the involvement of the Saudi government could lead to extra scrutiny when striking deals in other countries.After the Sprint deal, it seemed Mr. Son was looking ahead to retirement. That would have fit with a life plan he drew up while still in his 20s, in which he resolved to build a business empire and hand it over to a successor in his 60s. In 2014, he hired a star Google executive, Nikesh Arora, and all but anointed him to that role.But with the ARM acquisition, the chance for another big, transformative deal appears to have proved too tempting. Mr. Arora announced his resignation in June, a month before the acquisition. Mr. Son said he wanted to stay on for another decade or so to \u201cwork on a few more crazy ideas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Plays Hard to Get With Celebrities and Influencers", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The musician Jay Sean has visited the headquarters of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Instagram has reached out to tutor him on the best time to post photos for maximum impact.But there is one social media service Mr. Sean has not heard from, even though he frequently uses the app to post spontaneous snippets of his life: Snapchat.Instead of giving celebrities like Mr. Sean special treatment, Snapchat limits their perks and treats them like typical users. Instead of courting influencers, who are regular people with large followings on social media and who often promote products, the app is taking a hands-off approach with them.\u201cSnapchat serves a different purpose,\u201d Mr. Sean said. \u201cOn Snapchat, I really know my fans. They don\u2019t like anything too contrived or too staged on Snapchat.\u201dSnapchat says it prefers that celebrities use the app like everyday users, rather than as a platform to sell products. The company\u2019s terms of service prohibit getting paid to post, making influencer marketing a no-no. The company, based in Venice, Calif., said it does not want to harm Snapchat\u2019s image as a place where people go to interact with their friends.\u201cSnapchat is now in a very big battle for habitual users,\u201d said Grant Owens, the chief strategy officer of Critical Mass, a digital ad agency. While Snapchat makes money from advertising, Mr. Owens said, remaining relatively marketing-free will help the company differentiate itself.Google\u2019s YouTube even helped create a new category of online celebrity \u2014 the influencer \u2014 by elevating popular video creators on the platform. And Instagram supports celebrities and influencers by sharing data that can help them attract larger audiences.These moves have pushed many people to seek social media fame; some even try to make a living by selling products to their followers. These influencers have formed guilds, are supported by agents and are paid when they slip products into photos of themselves having fun and looking stylish.Snapchat does not cater to these groups. Instead of having celebrities and influencers make product placements on the service, Snapchat tightly controls its ads, which must meet a high bar, according to advertisers. The ads are typically designed to mirror the look and the feel of videos and photos that users already see on the messaging service.Yet for a social media company to eschew celebrities and influencers is risky.\u201cYou\u2019d be crazy not to serve them well, because they represent a large amount of engagement and activity on most platforms,\u201d said Michele Anderson, the chief operating officer of the media consulting firm Activate. To ignore influencers, she said, is a \u201cshortsighted business risk.\u201d\u201cYouTube, I have a rep and they help me out with anything,\u201d Mr. McBride says in the video. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to people at Instagram about how Instagram stories work and we work together on stuff. Snapchat, I don\u2019t really have a point of contact, and they\u2019re not really embracing their creators.\u201dIn an email, Mr. McBride said his relationship with Snapchat did not change after he posted the video.Snapchat is not celebrity-free. Apart from Mr. Sean, television personalities like Ryan Seacrest and musicians like Rihanna use the service. Last fall, the company rolled out \u201cofficial stories,\u201d a feature that identifies videos and pictures posted by widely known public figures like Michelle Obama and Jessica Alba. Only a few hundred Snapchat accounts have the official story designation, which are marked with an emoji and are easier for users to find than regular accounts.The tennis star Serena Williams became part of the official stories this year. She said she liked the upgrade because it \u201cmakes it easy for anyone to find me.\u201dYet celebrity accounts are not given other types of common preferential treatment. Their posts are not presented in a newsfeed, and an algorithm does not prioritize their content and automatically feed it to users. People must also choose to follow celebrity accounts and then opt to watch their stories. And Snapchat does not encourage celebrities to focus on metrics, nor does it reveal the number of followers a user has in the app.\u201cSnapchat isn\u2019t about the numbers,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cSnapchat is for my real fans.\u201dThe actor and comedian Kevin Hart, who has an official story account, also said the service gave him a more genuine connection with fans.\u201cSnapchat is where I go to connect with them in a fun, natural way,\u201d he said.Arielle Vandenberg, an actress and social media star with more than 900,000 followers on Instagram, said she had found it hard at first to build a following on Snapchat. Still, she has started using the app more than any other.\u201cIt feels like way more of a connection between me and the person who is watching,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I post a picture on Instagram, it could be taken two weeks ago. If I post on Snapchat, it\u2019s right there in the moment with the audience.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Sapna Maheshwari from New York.Advertisement"}

As I\u2019m new at covering this field, I asked a couple of colleagues if they could steer me to someone at Amazon who could take my question. They responded in a way that struck me as even more curious, acting as if I\u2019d asked them for their credit cards.There are a lot of holiday movies, and there are a lot more Christmas-themed holiday movies than Hanukkah-themed holiday movies (\u201cEight Crazy Nights,\u201d 2002, an animated \u201ctribute\u201d to Hanukkah that stars Adam Sandler, can be bought starting at $2.99 from iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu and Google Play, incidentally), and most holiday movies aren\u2019t very good. There aren\u2019t many as bad as \u201cZombie Lake,\u201d but as we\u2019ve already established \u2026 well, you know. Holiday Classic almost never equals Actual Classic. So here I\u2019d like to recommend a few holiday movies that are at least interesting.Netflix offers a bounty of the conventionally beloved (which also means widely disparaged) holiday pictures on its streaming service. Yes, there\u2019s \u201cLove Actually\u201d (2003); the increasingly well-liked \u201cScrooged\u201d (1988) (Bill Murray\u2019s latter-day sainthood has done a lot for this picture, which was greeted with tepid reviews on its theatrical release nearly 30 years ago); and the 1954 perennial \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d Starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney (in a relatively rare film role), this chestnut remains a very relaxed and genteel viewing experience, and has lots of pleasant Irving Berlin tunes. It can be an exceptional holiday decompressant.There\u2019s also a very unusual picture on Filmstruck: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u201cA Carol for Another Christmas\u201d (1964), a made-for-TV oddity. It has a nonsensically star-studded cast: Sterling Hayden is lectured by both Ben Gazzara and Steve Lawrence. Britt Ekland has a blink-and-you-miss-it silent cameo. This was actually one of four TV movies commissioned by the United Nations to foster the notion of world peace. Rod Serling\u2019s script recasts Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d to teach its own Scrooge (here named \u201cGrudge\u201d and played by Hayden) to stop worrying and love international cooperation. It plays pretty much exactly as you\u2019d expect a Rod Serling version of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d to play. It\u2019s spectacularly dated (although Peter Sellers\u2019s work as a future demagogue has a certain timeless quality), but if you want to boggle your movie-buff kin, this will do the trick.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Anime Master of Missed Connections Makes Strong Contact in Japan", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Wherever the Japanese animated filmmaker Makoto Shinkai goes these days, he gets some variation on the question of what it\u2019s like to be the Next Big Thing.Specifically, Mr. Shinkai, whose \u201cYour Name\u201d is the top-grossing movie of the year in Japan, is frequently asked how he feels about being the successor to Hayao Miyazaki, who has towered over Japanese animation for nearly three decades as the beloved creator of critically acclaimed hits like \u201cPrincess Mononoke\u201d and the Oscar-winning \u201cSpirited Away.\u201d\u201cI feel very honored, but I think it\u2019s an overestimation,\u201d Mr. Shinkai, 43, said during an interview at the offices here of Toho, the Japanese film production and distribution company, graciously rebuffing the coronation. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can replace Mr. Miyazaki.\u201dYet \u201cYour Name,\u201d which blends gender swapping with time travel, a natural disaster and star-crossed teenage lovers set to a J-pop soundtrack, is the second-biggest-grossing Japanese movie in the country\u2019s history, exceeded only by Mr. Miyazaki\u2019s \u201cSpirited Away.\u201d Since it opened in August, \u201cYour Name\u201d has spent 12 weeks at the top of the box office and has grossed 19.4 billion yen (about $170 million).\u201cYour Name\u201d has started a one-week Oscar qualifying run in Los Angeles and opened last week on 7,000 screens across China. (Funimation, its United States distributor, will give it a wider American release in early 2017.) The Japanese government is promoting \u201cYour Name\u201d \u2014 along with \u201cGodzilla Resurgence,\u201d another box office hit this year \u2014 as a major cultural export.Although the hit status is new for Mr. Shinkai, the themes in \u201cYour Name\u201d are not. Since his first film, \u201cVoices of a Distant Star\u201d (2002) \u2014 which he made almost entirely by himself on a computer \u2014 Mr. Shinkai has explored how young men and women do and do not connect. Text messages disappear, cellphone calls don\u2019t go through, and characters only just miss meeting on trains.In \u201cYour Name,\u201d Mitsuha, a country girl who longs to move to the big city, and Taki, a soulful Tokyo teenager, swap bodies in their dreams. Comedy ensues as they each discover the joys and challenges of being in the body of the opposite gender.But gradually, as they leave cellphone messages for each other describing what each has done in the other\u2019s body, romantic feelings kindle even though they have not met.In a slouchy gray cardigan, wire-rimmed glasses and a fuzzy soul patch, Mr. Shinkai sipped from a bottle of vending-machine iced coffee and smiled almost sheepishly as he described the recurring themes of his work.\u201cWhen I was young as a teenager, that was the biggest mystery in the world to me: Why don\u2019t people connect?\u201d said Mr. Shinkai, who is married with a 6-year-old daughter.\u201cEven now I have that kind of obsession,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mystery, and I\u2019m trying to search for an answer.\u201dBeyond the allure of teenage romance, \u201cYour Name\u201d has struck a chord here as it deals with a town\u2019s grief after a natural disaster. The comparison is inescapable to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that took close to 18,500 lives while setting off a nuclear meltdown at a power plant in Fukushima.\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to incorporate that theme into the work from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Shinkai said. \u201cBut, obviously, that was a very big event and disaster for the entire society in Japan.\u201dThe movie clearly taps into a sense of regret and wish fulfillment in Japan.\u201cMany people have the guilt of, \u2018Oh, there must have been something that we could have done,\u2019\u201d said Ryusuke Hikawa, a visiting professor at the graduate school of global Japanese studies at Meiji University here. \u201cThat is now part of the Japanese psyche.\u201dMr. Shinkai\u2019s method is different from that of many anime directors. He writes a script first, and for \u201cYour Name,\u201d even wrote a novelization, released two months beforehand, which has sold more than 1.3 million copies.Using a digital tablet, he lays down the dialogue, sound effects and music in a multimedia storyboard before introducing images.He readily describes his drawing ability as mediocre. To fill out the storyboard, he plucks images from around the web, including Google Maps, and then animators flesh out his vision.\u201cYour Name\u201d features exquisite detailed images of old Japanese customs in Mitsuha\u2019s hometown and the bustling modernity of Tokyo. Prosaic touches like a cellphone lighting a character\u2019s face at night take on an surprising beauty.\u201cI pay attention to the things that nobody else is looking at,\u201d Mr. Shinkai said. \u201cIn daily or everyday life, I am so impressed with tiny details, like when I look up at a street lamp falling on the street, it seems to have meaning or so much information in it.\u201d\u201cThe world,\u201d he added, \u201chas created everything perfectly.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mother Nature Is Brought to You By ...", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThis year, parks in several states including Idaho and Washington, and the National Park Service, will be blazing a new trail, figuratively at least, as they begin offering opportunities to advertisers within their borders.King County already partnered with Chipotle to hide 30 giant replica burritos on parkland bearing the logo of the agency and the restaurant chain. People who found the burritos won prizes from Chipotle.The logic behind these efforts is, in its own way, unimpeachable. Many millions of people \u2014 that is, \u201cgreen consumers\u201d \u2014 visit parks every day, representing an unrealized marketing opportunity of great value. Yes, parks are meant to be natural, not commercial, but times are tough, or so say the backers of the new schemes.The spread of advertising to natural settings is just a taste of what\u2019s coming. Over the next decade, prepare for a new wave of efforts to reach some of the last remaining bastions of peace, quiet and individual focus \u2014 like schools, libraries, churches and even our homes.Some of this reflects technological change, but the real reason is the business model of what I call the \u201cattention merchants.\u201d Unlike ordinary businesses, which sell a product, attention merchants sell people to advertisers. They do so either by finding captive audiences (like at a park or school) or by giving stuff away to gather up consumer data for resale.Once upon a time, this was a business model largely restricted to television and newspapers, where it remained within certain limits. Over the last decade, though, it has spread to nearly every new technology, and started penetrating spaces long thought inviolate.Nor are our workplaces and social spheres immune. The time and energy we spend socializing with friends and family has, almost incredibly, been harnessed for marketing, through the business models of Facebook, Instagram and other social media. At the office, the most successful of the productivity-killing distraction engines, BuzzFeed, brags of luring a \u201cbored at work\u201d network hundreds of millions strong.Unfortunately, there is worse yet to come: The nation\u2019s most talented engineers now apply themselves to making marketing platforms out of innovations \u2014 A.I. assistants like the Amazon Echo or self-driving cars. Here the intrusions will be subtle, even disguised, so as not to trip our defenses, but they will be even more powerful, going after our very decision-making processes. Consider how much we already depend on Siri or Google Maps: What happens when our most trusted tools have mixed motives?Advertising revenue often seems like \u201cfree money,\u201d but there are enormous risks for the character of any institution once it begins to rely heavily on advertising income. History and logic suggest that, once advertisers become a major funding source, they create their own priorities, and unless carefully controlled they will warp the underlying space to serve their interests.This development raises questions beyond the mere issue of how annoying ads can be. The model of individual liberty and a self-reliant citizenry was proposed by the founders and influenced by philosophers like John Stuart Mill, who envisioned sufficient time and space for self-development of character and room for making decisions that are truly ours.Similar ideas about the prerequisite of free will are to be found in the great spiritual traditions, which sanctify certain times and spaces for the sake of our spiritual development.These ideals are threatened by a way of doing business that by its nature seeks to invade the most sanctified of spaces.If you don\u2019t like the sound of this future, resistance is not futile \u2014 it is necessary. A commercial dystopia can be averted only by private resistance and principled decisions by the leaders of institutions.The first simply requires redrawing the lines that have been eroded. Where once upon a time, tradition or religion drew those lines for us, blocking out times for family and faith, nowadays personal or family initiative are required to define parts of our lives as off limits. The default setting will always be intrusion and distraction. We need to flip the switch.The second should be to reduce the attention economy by patronizing businesses or institutions with subscription models or those that keep advertising within reasonable limits.Third, the leaders of schools, libraries and even the more principled technology firms should understand that there is always a hidden cost to the proposition offered by advertising. Once an institution is dependent on ad revenue, it\u2019s impossible to put the Crest 3D White Radiant Mint toothpaste back in the tube.Above all, we should not simply resign ourselves to a world saturated by commercial appeals at the cost of our private and sacred spaces. As the great legal scholar Charles Black Jr. once put it, \u201cI tremble for the sanity of a society that talks, on the level of abstract principle, of the precious integrity of the individual mind, and all the while, on the level of concrete fact, forces the individual mind to spend a good part of every day under bombardment with whatever some crowd of promoters want to throw at it.\u201dTim Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Year of Big Ideas in Social Change", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byFixesSo far, of students in the program who had an average grade below a D in ninth grade, 73 percent managed to graduate, in a city where the overall average graduation rate for this group is 6 percent.Relationship-building has shown up a lot in Fixes this year as a method for tackling a wide variety of problems. It\u2019s one of several strategies that come up again and again. Here are our three nominations for the big ideas in social change we covered in 2016.Share a little of that human touch.Across the country from Baltimore, for years people in Washington State have been building community networks to improve their neighborhoods and cities. The push started with Washington\u2019s Family Policy Council, which was established in the 1990s to deal with youth violence. The group had a tiny budget \u2014 $4 million overall, or about a dollar for every person in the state. So what to do?In one particularly depressed area, the Highlands neighborhood of Longview, residents working together replaced broken porch lights; built or renovated a community center, garden and library; organized cleanup drives; began monthly chats with the police, and held free laundry days and bike giveaways.As in Baltimore, these efforts are also building connections and social capital. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to see a neighborhood association as another kind of infrastructure, like the streets, water or sewer system,\u201d said John Brickey, Longview\u2019s community development director. \u201cThe health of a neighborhood is just as dependent on it.\u201dUse tech to democratize.This strategy is pretty much the opposite of relationship-building. It\u2019s useful when the goal is to create wider availability for a product already being used by a small number of relatively wealthy people. One path is to use technology and data to make the distribution system more efficient and cheaper.Take green investing. For years, this has been a boutique affair. If you wanted to invest in ways that were good for the environment, you had to pay a stock-picker high fees and be prepared for low returns.Another example is civil legal aid. Even though people involved in civil cases can lose their apartments, their children and their jobs, the law does not guarantee them the services of a lawyer. In fact, it\u2019s very difficult for low-income Americans to get one.Many states are now considering laws that would make counsel a right in civil cases. Until that happens, we need other ways to get legal help to self-represented people.Insurance is standard in rich countries, but very rare in the poorest locales, where people need it more because they have no cushion against natural and economic crises. Millions of people live by herding cattle, for example, and climate-change-related drought is killing their herds. But selling them traditional insurance has been impossible, because in remote areas it\u2019s absurdly expensive to verify the death of an animal.Make the better choice the easy choice. When I lived in Latin America, one display of bad government I found in many places was this: Cities had lots of signs on the streets telling you not to litter \u2014 but no trash cans. People didn\u2019t need the government to tell them to dispose of their trash properly; they just needed trash cans. The key is to make it easy to do what\u2019s right.Look at teenage pregnancy and abortion. Some kinds of birth control, like pills or condoms, require women to remember to use them each day or each time they have sex. Others, called long-acting reversible contraception are devices women can have inserted or implanted once \u2014 and then not think about. \u201cSet and forget\u201d works better.For example, at first, the city wanted residents to take shorter showers. But mothers said showers were the only time in their day that they had to themselves. So officials chose easier goals at first, like offering free low-flow shower heads or shower head control valves that cut water use. Only later did they seek shorter showers.When the for-profit world tries to sell a product, tactics like asking target users for their ideas, piggybacking onto an activity consumers are doing anyway, or simplifying the buying process are so basic to efforts to sell us stuff that it\u2019s laughable to even discuss them. But they\u2019re not widespread in the nonprofit world \u2014 a pretty sad situation, since social change is often all about behavior change. Of course, reducing teenage pregnancy or encouraging organ donation isn\u2019t the same as selling soft drinks. But the nonprofits could learn a lot by studying how it\u2019s done.Advertisement"}

For China, at least, it now seems to be Silicon Valley\u2019s turn.What\u2019s going on here? Partly, it seems, the Chinese corporate tourists are beguiled by the Valley\u2019s dreamlike promises of changing the world and growing filthy rich almost overnight. Nothing too surprising there; in fact, not too different from the Hollywood fare so heavily consumed around the world.There\u2019s more to it than that, however. As Mr. Mozur writes, China has many accomplished technology companies, but they struggle with Confucian and Communist traditions of respecting order, consensus and seniority. Their American counterparts, raised on stories of pioneers on the frontier, thrive in a supposed ethos of \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201dThose are the exceptions, and for the most part Chinese tech is pretty slow-moving, particularly in the more government-sponsored areas, like semiconductors. Companies like Baidu, which champion a Chinese version of fast-moving Valley culture, are newer.Even there, when employees want to learn how to be more Valley-like, they are issued a copy of \u201cBaidu Analects,\u201d a kind of study guide to being spontaneous and independent. The effort sounds a little like a combination of \u201cThe Analects of Confucius\u201d and Mao\u2019s Little Red Book.If successful, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time American-style management has affected Asian business culture. Japan\u2019s huge postwar economic recovery, with a focus on quality products and productivity, is largely recognized as building on the ideas of W. Edwards Deming, an American engineer and statistician.Mr. Deming\u2019s ideas were readily taken up partly because they fit existing Japanese cultural practices. Turning China into a paradise of creative disruption is probably less likely. But who knows? Maybe on those tour buses is a future Mark Zuckerberg, and he\u2019ll be inspired by the giant \u201cthumbs-up\u201d logo outside Facebook headquarters.Advertisement"}

This is part of an annual seltzer-soaked exercise in temperance that he calls Drynuary.Over a couple of pints of beer \u2014 and, later, a seltzer-based drink \u2014 Mr. Ore was preparing to hit the reset button after a grueling holiday season filled with gluttony and family-related stress. Maybe you know the feeling. For those who are thinking of taking the month off from drinking, he has some pointers.\u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve not gotten my head around is the reaction of people I don\u2019t even know,\u201d he said of Drynuary\u2019s detractors, of whom there have been many, from those who think it trivializes the problem of binge drinking to those who just think it\u2019s stupid.\u201cLast year, someone tweeted at me and was like, \u2018Hey, Drynuary guy, I get what you\u2019re doing but you\u2019re kind of a smug \u2014\u2014,\u201d he said, ending the sentence with a four-letter expletive.Mr. Ore, a father of two, emphasizes that Drynuary is not a cult or a movement: \u201cI\u2019m not recruiting.\u201dDuring the month of January, Mr. Ore is a Canada Dry kind of guy. He enjoys mixing fruit with his seltzer. At the Brass Monkey, he swaps his Lagunitas for seltzer with a splash of cranberry and lime.\u201cIt\u2019s like a virgin Cape Cod or something,\u201d he said after taking a sip of the slightly syrupy drink. He thinks of an alternative name for this mocktail: the Drynuary Sadness.For those new to Drynuary, Mr. Ore says that ordering a seltzer drink at a bar or a party can be a provocation, mostly because others may be compelled to try to undo any progress with peer pressure.\u201cIf people get salty about it, it says more about them than it does about you,\u201d he said. \u201cSay, \u2018This is why I do it, and this is what I\u2019m getting out of it.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe first week, you\u2019re overenergized,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m having lucid dreams more often.\u201dThe second week, his clothes fit better, but after that, it\u2019s all uphill.

{"Headline": "Obama to Dismantle Visitor Registry Before Trump Can Revive It", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byThe registry, created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has not been in use since 2011, so the move is largely symbolic and appeared to be aimed at distancing the departing administration from any effort by the new president to revive the program, known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or Nseers.Asked on Wednesday, in the aftermath of the Berlin attack, whether he still intended to set up a registry for Muslims and impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants, Mr. Trump said in Florida, \u201cYou know my plans.\u201d Hours later, a spokesman said Mr. Trump was not reaffirming his earlier calls for a ban on immigration from Muslim countries but was referring to his more recent clarification that he would bar people from countries with a history of Islamist extremism.A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Among the Republican proponents of the registry program is Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. Mr. Kobach, an anti-immigration hard-liner, helped to devise the program while at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration.That information, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the campaign trail, prompted Democratic lawmakers, mayors from cities with large foreign-born populations and some business leaders in Silicon Valley to call on Mr. Obama to undo the legal framework that undergirds the program.That can be done with a rule change. The Department of Homeland Security submitted such a rule change for public posting on Thursday morning, and it is set to be published in the federal register on Friday.\u201cD.H.S. ceased use of Nseers more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security,\u201d Neema Hakim, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. The program is \u201cnot only obsolete\u201d and \u201coutdated,\u201d but diverts personnel and resources from other areas that are seen as more effective, the statement said.Some experts say there is no need for a registry.Officials in the agency have long believed that the program has outlived its usefulness. A number of newer programs, developed in the years since the Nseers system was put into place, capture a vast amount of information that allows customs officers to flag for additional questioning people from certain countries or those with unusual travel itineraries.A 2012 report by the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security said that since 2006, senior officials in the agency had been calling for the termination of the program, and in the report, the inspector general recommended that it be ended. \u201cInformation obtained from fingerprints, flight manifests, travel and identification documents and intelligence sources is more valuable in determining who poses a potential national security risk,\u201d the report said, citing customs and border control officers.An analysis of how a ban could be carried out and how many people would be affected.\u201cLeaving the regulatory structure of the Nseers program in place provides no discernible public benefit,\u201d the report said.The regulations that are being undone date to 1991, at the time of the first gulf war, when immigration authorities began requiring the registration and fingerprinting of certain nonimmigrant travelers entering the United States from Iraq and Kuwait. The authorities removed the requirements for those countries two years later but retained provisions preserving the attorney general\u2019s power to compel the same information from nonimmigrants from specific countries.A decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security, which had taken over the program, said it had stopped registering arrivals from the designated countries and removed all countries from the list. But the move left in place the regulations that allowed for it to be restarted.\u201cNo known terrorism convictions have resulted from the program,\u201d read a joint letter, dated Dec. 1, from more than 50 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat and a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump, said the program was \u201can affront to our core American values of pluralism and equal justice under law.\u201dFacebook, Microsoft, Google and Apple are among several technology companies that have publicly stated that they would not assist the new administration in developing any program that would collect information that could be used by the government to track immigrants from Muslim countries.The technology companies took action after thousands of Silicon Valley engineers signed a pledge saying they stood in solidarity with Muslim Americans and immigrants and would not use their skills for the \u201cnew administration\u2019s proposed data-collection policies.\u201dMr. Hakim, in his statement, said the regulations had long since been replaced by automated systems and programs that were not in place at the start of the registry program \u2014 which required in-person interviews by federal agents and targeted specific countries.The new tools are \u201cfar better equipped to face the evolving landscape of international terrorism,\u201d he said. Those programs include an automated system for collecting and storing biometric data such as fingerprints from nearly all people entering the country.The changes are set to take effect immediately after they are published on Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Change Their Tone on AT&T and Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byAt a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that was being closely watched for how mega-mergers will be viewed in the coming Trump administration, members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees regulatory agencies that decide on mergers said the deal merited tough scrutiny. The chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner were grilled at the hearing about a range of issues related to the deal.But in a change from previous comments, lawmakers also questioned whether traditional ways of evaluating mergers are growing outdated as Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google become massive media platforms that threaten the television industry. Their tone was more circumspect than those that immediately followed the deal\u2019s announcement, when lawmakers had been more critical.\u201cWe want to ensure that competition thrives in this critical market and we don\u2019t stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who heads the full Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley said Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have transformed the video landscape.Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, said the deal would combine companies that did not directly compete against one another. \u201cThe consumer is benefited from the aggregation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is called capitalism.\u201dOver all, senators were asking \u201chard questions,\u201d said Larry Downes, a professor at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough School of Business. But, he added, \u201cthey seem to be open-minded about the changing nature of competition in the information sector.\u201dAT&T, a telecom giant, and Time Warner, which owns CNN and HBO, had said in October that AT&T would buy Time Warner to create a mobile video powerhouse. The hearing may have implications beyond this deal, with the comments potentially encouraging more acquisitions by companies that have been waiting out the Obama administration, which has rejected several mergers.\u201cThe D.O.J. pays particularly close attention to Senate and House antitrust subcommittees because they oversee the D.O.J.,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company, who added that the committee\u2019s commentary \u201cbears watching for its potential effect on the D.O.J.\u201d Members of the Justice Department attended the hearing.When the deal was announced, days before the presidential election, leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued strong cautionary statements about it. Donald J. Trump, on the campaign trail at the time, said he would block the merger if elected. He has singled out CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner, with particular rancor for its election coverage.As president, Mr. Trump will have no direct power over mergers, but he will greatly influence which ones are approved, depending on whom he picks to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust or the chairman of the F.C.C. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, told CNBC before the hearing that he had not had contact with the Trump transition team.During the hearing, the companies pitched a message that catered to the new administration: a populist promise of lower prices and the potential to build more wireless infrastructure through the merger. While AT&T and Time Warner are powerhouses, they presented themselves as weaker rivals to the cable industry and Silicon Valley tech companies.Mr. Stephenson said in prepared remarks that cable companies dominated the broadband and television market, serving high-speed internet to eight of every 10 American homes that have broadband service. To experiment with new mobile video technologies, he said, AT&T needed to have in-house content to quickly try new streaming services at a lower cost. He added that AT&T had just introduced a streaming service with 100 channels for less than most cable television packages.\u201cIt is only the beginning of what we want to bring to the marketplace to threaten cable\u2019s entrenched and still-dominant market position,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. He said AT&T would give CNN editorial independence if the merger were approved.Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, \u201cIt is not enough to deliver great content.\u201d The companies\u2019 competitors have multiplied, he said.No lawmakers at the hearing said the merger should be blocked, but several expressed skepticism.\u201cI have serious concerns about this transaction,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. The deal \u201cpotentially has serious negative impacts on competition and on consumers.\u201dMark Cuban, an internet entrepreneur and owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, who also spoke at the hearing, said the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. \u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Consumer groups rejected the characterization of AT&T and Time Warner as disadvantaged rivals, saying a combined company would create a powerhouse that all cable providers and networks would have to negotiate with. Streaming providers like Sling TV and Hulu would face a major new competitor, with AT&T\u2019s access to 110 million wireless and satellite subscribers and premium television networks under the same roof, the groups said.Advertisement"}

Trump and the nation\u2019s tech elite was hyped as something out of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of \u201cDancing With the Silicon Valley Stars.\u201d\u201cThis is a truly amazing group of people,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The gathering included Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Elon Musk of Tesla; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, among others. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you folks do well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He kept going in that vein. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like you in the world,\u201d he enthused. \u201cIn the world! There\u2019s nobody like the people in this room.\u201d Anything that the government \u201ccan do to help this go along,\u201d he made clear, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be there for you.\u201dAnd that was just in the first few minutes. The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen.Even after the press was ushered out, the meeting continued its genial way. Among the topics discussed, according to several corporate executives and a transition official briefed on the meeting, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, were vocational education and the need for more of it, the promise and peril of trade with China and immigration (Mr. Trump wants \u201csmart and talented people here\u201d). The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste.There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you the hundreds of calls we\u2019ve had asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed.To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would \u2014 by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait.Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower\u2019s holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up.Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d\u201cI shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech \u2014 agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing \u2014 everywhere,\u201d he said.The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump\u2019s values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality.Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.)Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect\u2019s medium of choice for communication, was not invited.In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear.A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin.Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties.Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration.\u201cWe have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,\u201d he said.More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too.In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent.One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration.Another reason: less tech spending by the government. \u201cThere are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,\u201d said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst.As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs,\u201d the analyst said.So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He criticized Chuck Jones, a union leader in Indiana who represents workers at the Carrier air-conditioning plant where Trump intervened to save people\u2019s jobs. Jones had criticized some aspects of the deal, and Trump didn\u2019t like it, so he accused Jones of doing a \u201cterrible job representing workers.\u201dSome have argued that by going after individuals, Trump is violating Twitter\u2019s terms of service.

One, you heartily LOL, like I did, when you see a company literally publish a running chronicle on how and why it has messed things up with its ad tech and analytics. It\u2019s worrisome that some of these things haven\u2019t been worked out entirely, and that billions of dollars are being spent on what seems to be imperfect measurement and definitions on what the biggest marketers in the world are paying for.The flip side of that coin, however, is that Facebook is aiming for transparency around an imperfect system in continuous development, something that not all companies would necessarily do. I do wonder what something like this would have looked like were Google to have done it as it developed and fine-tuned AdWords, the company\u2019s goose that keeps laying golden eggs, even years later.All of that said, one of the things I keep hearing from marketers who have followed this is pretty important: If your return on investment is proven, then who cares if some of the metrics are off by a bit? It seems a bit oversimplified, but I can take the point.And really, there\u2019s no actual recourse for most smaller advertisers who have no choice but to keep buying Facebook ads. Facebook and Google are the only games in town \u2014 for now, at least.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Parent Company Spins Off Self-Driving Car Business", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s self-driving car is ready to take the wheel.Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, said on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company under the name Waymo.Alphabet\u2019s decision to spin out Waymo is a signal that the company thinks its self-driving technology has advanced beyond research project status and is ready for commercialization.Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers \u2014 all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry.Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning \u2014 the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time \u2014 mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years.\u201cAs we look at this space and the opportunities ahead of us, we see so much,\u201d said John Krafcik, chief executive of Waymo. \u201cWe\u2019re a new company, but we\u2019ve been at this for a while.\u201dWaymo joins the roster of Alphabet companies, which includes Google. Mr. Krafcik said the new arrangement allows Waymo to tap into the infrastructure and resources of Alphabet with the feel of an independent venture-backed company. He said Waymo\u2019s technology could have uses as varied as ride-sharing services and long-haul trucking, but he did not lay out a specific business strategy.Alphabet was an early technological leader in the field, but its efforts to establish a business around the technology have fallen short. Since 2009, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving cars have logged 2.3 million driverless miles \u2014 the equivalent of more than 400 round-trip drives from New York to Los Angeles \u2014 on test drives in California, Arizona, Texas and Washington state. Waymo said it completed the world\u2019s first fully driverless ride on public roads last year in Austin, Texas, with a blind passenger in a car without a steering wheel or pedals.Safely ensconced in Google\u2019s so-called moonshot factory, the self-driving car project did not face the type of financial pressure to commercialize its technology that a start-up or a company without Google\u2019s resources would have. Despite its head start, other companies have incorporated autonomous driving technology into their products and services more quickly.For Google, the goal was to design a vehicle that is responsible for 100 percent of the driving. The company said this approach was more difficult and would take more time. However, Google said it was ultimately safer than semiautonomous vehicles, which may require a driver to take back control of the car without awareness of the surroundings.Waymo said its ultimate goal was to equip its driverless system on cars without steering wheels or pedals because it didn\u2019t want humans to feel as if they needed to monitor the vehicle. However, government regulations currently require a vehicle to have steering wheels and pedals.In August 2015, Google brought in Mr. Krafcik, a former Hyundai Motor executive, to lead the project and bring it closer to commercialization. It has also lost crucial personnel on the project, sometimes to competitors.\u201cGoogle has struggled to find a way to come to market,\u201d said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where Google needs a return.\u201dThe challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesn\u2019t have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares \u2014 at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesn\u2019t have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain.It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems \u2014 akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google.This year, Google reached a deal with Fiat Chrysler to equip its automated driving systems in 100 Pacifica minivans to try to make it easier for the technology to be installed on an assembly line.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really clear that we\u2019re not a car company,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of making better cars. We\u2019re in the business of making better drivers.\u201dThe technology site The Information reported earlier that Waymo was considering building a ride-sharing network with the minivans. When asked about that possibility, Mr. Krafcik said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dIt\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s also about data. Without a way of getting its systems on the road through a ride-sharing network or an automaker, Google may struggle to collect valuable on-the-road information \u2014 a crucial part of helping its driving systems learn and improve over time.Dmitri Dolgov, who oversees the development of self-driving technology for Waymo, said the next step for his team would be to make the ride for driverless cars smoother and more natural, build out the map system to allow it to go to more places, and handle different weather conditions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Chief Technology Officer to Leave Company", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter\u2019s streak of executive turnover is continuing.\u201cAfter 5 years I\u2019ve decided to leave Twitter and take some time off,\u201d Mr. Messinger said in the post.One of the biggest blows to Twitter was the loss of Mr. Bain, who was an unofficial internal mascot beloved by many employees for his cheerful demeanor and his cheerleading of the company. Anthony Noto, who was Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, took over the chief operating officer position, and the company is now searching for a new C.F.O.Mr. Messinger joined Twitter in 2011 from the software company Oracle. He began as a vice president working on engineering infrastructure and later moved to a position overseeing application development. He became chief technology officer in 2013.Over the past year, Mr. Messinger had been awarded more responsibilities by Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive. After some executive reshuffling, Mr. Messinger gained oversight of the engineering organization, as well as product development and design. He helped decide on Twitter\u2019s new product leader, Keith Coleman, a former Google employee who had worked on that company\u2019s Gmail and chat apps.\u201cI\u2019ll be working even closer with our engineering and design teams to ensure we continue to be the fastest and best service to show what\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in a statement.Mr. Messinger\u2019s supporters at Twitter lauded what they described as his cerebral approach, but he also had detractors who said he was indecisive and sometimes did not take enough concrete steps to make changes happen, according to three former Twitter employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the interactions were private.Mr. Messinger did not say what he would do after leaving Twitter. A person with knowledge of Mr. Messinger\u2019s plans, who asked to remain anonymous because the person was not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Messinger did not plan to head to a competing social network like Facebook or Snapchat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Problem Isn\u2019t Fake News \u2014 It\u2019s the Rest of the Internet", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byNotebookLast Thursday, after weeks of criticism over its role in the proliferation of falsehoods and propaganda during the presidential election, Facebook announced its plan to combat \u201choaxes\u201d and \u201cfake news.\u201d The company promised to test new tools that would allow users to report misinformation, and to enlist fact-checking organizations including Snopes and PolitiFact to help litigate the veracity of links reported as suspect. By analyzing patterns of reading and sharing, the company said, it might be able to penalize articles that are shared at especially low rates by those who read them \u2014 a signal of dissatisfaction. Finally, it said, it would try to put economic pressure on bad actors in three ways: by banning disputed stories from its advertising ecosystem; by making it harder to impersonate credible sites on the platform; and, crucially, by penalizing websites that are loaded with too many ads.Facebook\u2019s political news ecosystem during the 2016 election was vast and varied. There was, of course, content created by outside news media that was shared by users, but there were also reams of content \u2014 posts, images, videos \u2014 created on Facebook-only pages, and still more media created by politicians themselves. During the election, it was apparent to almost anyone with an account that Facebook was teeming with political content, much of it extremely partisan or pitched, its sourcing sometimes obvious, other times obscured, and often simply beside the point \u2014 memes or rants or theories that spoke for themselves.Facebook seems to have zeroed in on only one component of this ecosystem \u2014 outside websites \u2014 and within it, narrow types of bad actors. These firms are, generally speaking, paid by advertising companies independent of Facebook, which are unaware of or indifferent to their partners\u2019 sources of audience. Accordingly, Facebook\u2019s anti-hoax measures seek to regulate these sites by punishing them not just for what they do on Facebook, but for what they do outside of it.\u201cWe\u2019ve found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated,\u201d Mosseri wrote. \u201cSpammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organizations and posting hoaxes that get people to visit to their sites, which are often mostly ads.\u201d The proposed solution: \u201cAnalyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary.\u201dIn this context, this \u201cfake news\u201d problem reads less as a distinct new phenomenon than as a flaring symptom of an older, more existential anxiety that Facebook has been grappling with for years: its continued (albeit diminishing) dependence on the same outside web that it, and other platforms, have begun to replace. Facebook\u2019s plan for \u201cfake news\u201d is no doubt intended to curb certain types of misinformation. But it\u2019s also a continuation of the company\u2019s bigger and more consequential project \u2014 to capture the experiences of the web it wants and from which it can profit, but to insulate itself from the parts that it doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t. This may help solve a problem within the ecosystem of outside publishers \u2014 an ecosystem that, in the distribution machinery of Facebook, is becoming redundant, and perhaps even obsolete.To understand what such ambition looks like in practice, consider Facebook\u2019s history. It started as an inward-facing website, closed off from both the web around it and the general public. It was a place to connect with other people, and where content was created primarily by other users: photos, wall posts, messages. This system quickly grew larger and more complex, leading to the creation, in 2006, of the news feed \u2014 a single location in which users could find updates from all of their Facebook friends, in roughly reverse-chronological order.Facebook, for its part, paid close attention to the sorts of external content people were sharing on its platform and to the techniques used by websites to get an edge. It adapted continually. It provided greater video functionality, reducing the need to link to outside videos or embed them from YouTube. As people began posting more news, it created previews for links, with larger images and headlines and longer summaries; eventually, it created Instant Articles, allowing certain publishers (including The Times) to publish stories natively in Facebook. At the same time, it routinely sought to penalize sites it judged to be using the platform in bad faith, taking aim at \u201cclickbait,\u201d an older cousin of \u201cfake news,\u201d with a series of design and algorithm updates. As Facebook\u2019s influence over online media became unavoidably obvious, its broad approach to users and the web became clearer: If the network became a popular venue for a certain sort of content or behavior, the company generally and reasonably tried to make that behavior easier or that content more accessible. This tended to mean, however, bringing it in-house.To Facebook, the problem with \u201cfake news\u201d is not just the obvious damage to the discourse, but also with the harm it inflicts upon the platform. People sharing hoax stories were, presumably, happy enough with they were seeing. But the people who would then encounter those stories in their feeds were subjected to a less positive experience. They were sent outside the platform to a website where they realized they were being deceived, or where they were exposed to ads or something that felt like spam, or where they were persuaded to share something that might later make them look like a rube. These users might rightly associate these experiences not just with their friends on the platform, or with the sites peddling the bogus stories but also with the platform itself. This created, finally, an obvious issue for a company built on attention, advertising and the promotion of outside brands. From the platform\u2019s perspective, \u201cfake news\u201d is essentially a user-experience problem resulting from a lingering design issue \u2014 akin to slow-loading news websites that feature auto-playing videos and obtrusive ads.Increasingly, legitimacy within Facebook\u2019s ecosystem is conferred according to a participant\u2019s relationship to the platform\u2019s design. A verified user telling a lie, be it a friend from high school or the president elect, isn\u2019t breaking the rules; he is, as his checkmark suggests, who he represents himself to be. A post making false claims about a product is Facebook\u2019s problem only if that post is labeled an ad. A user video promoting a conspiracy theory becomes a problem only when it leads to the violation of community guidelines against, for example, user harassment. Facebook contains a lot more than just news, including a great deal of content that is newslike, partisan, widely shared and often misleading. Content that has been, and will be, immune from current \u201cfake news\u201d critiques and crackdowns, because it never had the opportunity to declare itself news in the first place. To publish lies as \u201cnews\u201d is to break a promise; to publish lies as \u201ccontent\u201d is not.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oakland Fire: Delving Into What Happened, and Why", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byLess than one week after a blaze ripped through a ramshackle warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, this shocked city is grappling with an array of questions about what precisely happened, many of them deeply troubling.To try to answer them, The New York Times is deploying a team of journalists across Oakland as part of an investigative reporting effort.We would typically reveal our findings in an article published at the end of our reporting.This time, though, we are doing something different: We are going to share regular updates on what we uncover as we do our reporting.We\u2019ll tell you about the interviews that our journalists conduct, the documents we obtain and what we learn as we learn it \u2014 as part of our effort to piece this story together.\u2022 Could the city have done more to prevent the Ghost Ship fire? What did the city know about the violations at the warehouse? Did it follow up on citations?\u2022 What was the cause of the blaze?\u2022 What more can be learned about the owner and tenant-manager? Who is ultimately responsible?\u2022 Should this tragedy result in more crackdowns on illegal housing in Oakland?\u2022 Who are the people living in spaces like the Ghost Ship?\u2022 Are there other places like it in Oakland, and why do people choose to live there?\u2022 What does this story tell us about gentrification in the city?\u2022 What does the fire mean for Oakland?Yamiche Alcindor is on the team of Times reporters looking into the aftermath of the fire.On Wednesday, I set off to find out more about Oakland\u2019s fire inspection codes, which have become a major focus since the fire.Topping the list of people to contact was Zac Unger, vice president of Local 55, the Oakland firefighters union, who had told several news outlets that the Fire Department had suffered from mismanagement. After playing phone tag for part of the morning, Mr. Unger spoke with me for about half an hour and laid out what he said were years of problems in the department.Specifically, Mr. Unger said he had complained regularly to city officials, telling them that the city does not have enough fire inspectors and that its Fire Department lacks proper resources. Mr. Unger also said he had openly criticized Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed for going several years without having a fire marshal to oversee whether the city was inspecting the proper number of buildings and potentially hazardous spaces.\u201cI said specifically the mismanagement of the Fire Department is going to lead to a tragedy and you need to do something about it now, and I am heartbroken to have been proven right and to have all of these people dead,\u201d Mr. Unger said.Still, it is too early to say if city officials could have done more to prevent the fire. Officials have not said how many times fire inspectors visited the Ghost Ship to check for fire hazards, or if city code inspectors ever flagged the building as being used for something other than its zoned purpose. (I am awaiting a response from the fire chief and other city officials.)Sgt. Barry Donelan, the president of the Oakland Police Officers\u2019 Association, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to expect police officers responding to emergencies to also determine if the buildings they enter have dangerous living conditions. \u201cMy guys are trying to get out there and protect our community,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to do their duties. But you can\u2019t be effective in arrests and imposing building codes. That\u2019s ludicrous.\u201dHe added that in their reports, officers focus on crimes like robberies or domestic violence, and don\u2019t scour residences for code violations. He said he wasn\u2019t sure how many times officers had visited the Ghost Ship.The warehouse was run by a married couple, Derick Ion Almena \u2014 also known as Derick Ion \u2014 and Micah Allison, whom residents described as the \u201cmaster tenants\u201d who rented the building and sublet parts of it to others.According to its records, Oakland\u2019s Planning and Building Department has not had an inspector inside the Ghost Ship in the last 30 years, Darin Ranelletti, the department\u2019s interim director, said Wednesday. \u201cThat means that we had no applications for permits in the last 30 years and there were no violations that were submitted for interior work within the main building attributed to that street address,\u201d he said.Thomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief of The Times.No one answered the door at a building known as the Deathtrap, another warehouse inhabited by artists in West Oakland. Residents at many such collectives operating in the gray areas of the law are now very concerned about a crackdown.While I was taking stock of this one-story building, which sits in a neighborhood of vacant lots, industrial workshops and a billboard announcing plans for a \u201cluxury\u201d development, a middle-aged man pulled up in a battered black vehicle that resembled an El Camino.As soon as I announced that I was a reporter, he told me residents were planning to issue a statement soon. It\u2019s a sign of how badgered by the media Oakland artists have been in recent days that an art collective known as the Deathtrap is pushing out a news release.\u201cThere are definitely concerns that this will lead to evictions,\u201d said the man, a Deathtrap resident, refusing to give me his name. \u201cEveryone is tense.\u201dBut what about the safety of the people who live in these structures?\u201cThe warehouse scene in Oakland is very diverse,\u201d he said. \u201cTo judge us all by the same standard would be a mistake.\u201dOakland has always attracted artists, musicians and other performers to its postindustrial grittiness and sprawling landscape of warehouses. In recent years, the city has become even more of an artistic hub as economic refugees have crossed the Bay Bridge from unaffordable San Francisco.The Ghost Ship fire, heart-wrenching for its loss of life, is sending panic through the art community here because of fears that such spaces could be shut down.Matt Hummel, a longtime member of Oakland\u2019s artistic scene who at one point ran for City Council, spoke about these fears among artist collectives that, before the fire, openly advertised their locations and parties.\u201cEveryone is scrubbing their Facebook feeds, going to Google and saying, \u2018This place never existed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey are erasing everything.\u201dArtists, Mr. Hummel said, are communicating by Signal, an encrypted messaging system.While I was typing up this note in the back of my car, which was parked on Fruitvale Avenue, just a few steps from site of the Ghost Ship fire, Libby Schaaf, the Oakland mayor, called.Should artists be worried?\u201cWe have gone through an immense tragedy,\u201d Ms. Schaaf replied, \u201cbut it would be another tragedy if we did not learn lessons from this and improve every system we have to improve the safety of our residents.\u201dIn cracking down on fire standards, is there a risk of destroying the artistic community that the city wants to preserve?\u201cI am born and raised in Oakland,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what a personal commitment I have to preserving and lifting up that unique and creative energy that makes Oakland Oakland.\u201dThere will be no \u201cwitch hunts,\u201d she vowed.Mr. Hummel said he feared that landlords would use the fire to justify kicking out low-rent tenants, skirting the city\u2019s considerable tenant protections to upgrade and get higher-paying renters.Mr. Hummel, who used to live in a communal warehouse space, said he has been to many other artist spaces, and though they might not be up to code, they are not nearly as dangerous as the Ghost Ship, which residents say had a makeshift electrical system and timber artwork, wooden partitions and a wooden staircase \u2014 what proved to be a treacherous mix of combustible materials.Artist warehouses had gone five decades without a catastrophic fire like this, he pointed out.\u201cThe majority of these places are not an inferno waiting to happen,\u201d he said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Wants Driverless Cars, but Do We?", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the glorious future, we are assured that driverless cars will save lives, reduce accidents, ease congestion, curb energy consumption and lower harmful emissions. These purported benefits contain elements of truth. But the data is nowhere near complete. Even stipulating that all the claimed benefits will one day materialize, the near- and midterm picture from a public-interest perspective is not the same favorable one that industry sees. Legitimate areas of question and concern remain.Take, for instance, the \u201csafety\u201d benefits of self-driving cars that include avoiding tens of thousands of highway deaths each year. The truth is, no one knows for sure how many lives could be saved by driverless cars, because data on the role of human error in crashes is incomplete and misleading, relying heavily on self-reporting. The types of accidents we\u2019ll face in this automated future, in which these cars are meant to run together in proximity at high speed, may be fewer, but they\u2019ll be new, different, unpredictable and, on occasion, larger and more grisly than the ones we know today. When 1,700 people leave the New Jersey Turnpike at more or less the same moment, all headed for the same parking spot near the food court at the Vince Lombardi rest area, you don\u2019t want to be there.Yes, jobs will be created by these new cars, but many will be lost. Millions of truck and taxi drivers will be out of work, and owing to the rise of car-sharing and app-based car services, people may buy fewer vehicles, meaning automakers and their suppliers could be forced to shed jobs.Then there\u2019s infrastructure. Huge investments in new infrastructure are a given, but huge investments in old infrastructure will also still be needed. Many of these new-generation cars require smooth roads, with clearly painted lines, to safely position themselves. Potholes, worn paint and other irregularities \u2014 standard fare on too many of today\u2019s roads \u2014 will potentially become even greater safety hazards than they are now. Where will the resources to maintain and repair roads and bridges, an effort already underfunded by more than a trillion dollars, come from?And what about the interim period when conventional vehicles share the road with automated ones? One of the claims made for autonomous cars is that they can be lighter, shedding heavy metal crash cells and expensive safety gear, like airbags, saving fuel. That\u2019s great until the old-school pickup with the old-fashioned drunken driver T-bones your Google car.What\u2019s more, are we ready to give up on mass transit? In a world where our elected officials can\u2019t see fit to fund and fairly price much-needed public transportation, it\u2019s hard to imagine these new automated-car expenses will free up money for trains and trams. And yet many cities are so crowded they don\u2019t have room for more cars \u2014 even automated, electric cars congest.We humans can\u2019t seem to put our phones down, and industry leaders don\u2019t want us to. The risk of distracted driving may be one of the strongest arguments for driverless cars. But distracted driving could be reduced simply by disabling phones in moving cars.When it comes to the practical direction of technology, the government too often defers to industry. Shouldn\u2019t society have a say in what amounts to a public works project larger than the Interstate System of highways \u2014 run by and for private industry, but underwritten by taxpayers? Congress needs to articulate their goals and answer this burning question: Are driverless cars really what we need?Jamie Lincoln Kitman, a lawyer, is the New York bureau chief for Automobile Magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2,300 U.S. Foreclosures Show a Racial Divide in House Decay", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxThe modest white house on Arlene Avenue in Dayton, Ohio, was an eyesore. The paint was peeling, and parts of the shutters were missing. The yard was thickly overgrown, and the back door, such as it was, had been jury-rigged from plywood.The home on Jeanette Street in New Orleans didn\u2019t look much better, with its broken steps, exposed wiring and vines sprouting from the gutter.And the pale-green property on 64th Avenue in Oakland, Calif., ticked off many of the same complaints: broken windows, damaged fence, rotten wood, peeling paint.Each of these homes, among more than 2,300 foreclosures around the country visited by fair-housing testers between 2011 and 2015, sits in a census tract that is overwhelmingly nonwhite. Nonprofit housing advocacy groups allege in a federal district court lawsuit filed in California this month that the lender responsible for maintaining them, the quasi-government agency Fannie Mae, allowed them to deteriorate.The organizations, led by the National Fair Housing Alliance, say that Fannie Mae has systematically failed to care for houses in foreclosure in minority neighborhoods while ensuring that those in working- and middle-class white communities were well tended and ready for sale. The lawsuit says these racial disparities in the foreclosure crisis arose well after the predatory lending that forced many families out of their homes. The disparities also appeared in scenes of vacant homes once those families left.Using criteria similar to Fannie Mae\u2019s own maintenance checklist, investigators tallied the number of problems with each property \u2014 a broken gutter, a missing mailbox, an unmowed lawn \u2014 and concluded that foreclosures in predominantly minority neighborhoods were more likely to rack up deficiencies.The case is largely about the second-order casualties of foreclosure: the neighbors who live next door, the depressed value of adjacent property and the local housing markets that have recovered slowly where vacant properties accumulated. These cascading consequences, the lawsuit claims, have disproportionately fallen on minority neighborhoods.\u201cPeople looking at this from the outside say, \u2018Well, those homes were in bad condition,\u2019 or \u2018They shouldn\u2019t have gotten those homes,\u2019 and they\u2019ll blame those homeowners who lost their homes,\u201d said Shanna Smith, the president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. \u201cOur investigation is trying to help the people who didn\u2019t lose their homes and live in that neighborhood and are struggling to build equity and pass on something to their children.\u201dNational Fair Housing AllianceFannie Mae said in a statement that it strongly disagrees with the allegations and that its maintenance standards \u201care designed to ensure that all properties are tended to and treated equally.\u201d A spokeswoman says the agency tries to use local maintenance contractors. It also said it now had a national policy that those contractors use glasslike material instead of plywood on broken windows and doors, eliminating the most visible sign of blight.Fannie Mae said that a property should receive the same core maintenance regardless of the condition the home is in when the agency takes possession of it. It would not comment, though, on how much it spends on such foreclosure maintenance each year, citing the litigation.The groups\u2019 evidence comes from a yearslong investigation in which housing advocates visited Fannie-owned properties in 38 metropolitan areas. They looked at ZIP codes in both minority and predominantly white working- and middle-class communities with a high number of foreclosures. For each property, investigators assessed basic maintenance items, including whether the lawn had been tended, windows repaired and exterior holes fixed. They checked for damaged siding, unsecured doors and the for-sale signs that mean brokers are actively trying to market a home.National Fair Housing AllianceEvery property and every individual deficiency was photographed, creating a collection of nearly 50,000 images of the American foreclosure crisis, from Midwestern bungalows to California McMansions in widely varying condition. (Although Google Street View suggests that some of the homes visited several years ago have since come back to life, the groups were able to study only a small share of the foreclosed properties under Fannie Mae.)In their database of properties, one-third of the foreclosed properties in census tracts that were at least 75 percent white had fewer than five problems. The same was true of just 9 percent of foreclosures in census tracts that were more than 75 percent nonwhite.About a third of foreclosures in those heavily minority tracts had more than 10 problems. By contrast, just 7 percent of properties in heavily white areas had that many problems. Many individual issues \u2014 unsecured doors, boarded-up windows, overgrown shrubbery \u2014 were also significantly more common in the minority neighborhoods than in the white ones.According to a regression analysis cited in the suit, differences in local crime levels, property values, sales dates, prices and other nonracial factors account for only about one-third of these disparities. The persistent pattern, the lawsuit claims, can be explained only by race.National Fair Housing AllianceThe consistency of the finding nationwide suggests a problem baked into Fannie Mae itself, Ms. Smith said, and not limited to the behavior of individual contractors hired to do this maintenance work. A similar investigation did not find the same racial disparities among the smaller stock of foreclosures managed by Freddie Mac, another quasi-government lending agency.\u201cThe simplicity of the investigation is that Fannie had the money, they paid contractors to do the work,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cAnd Fannie utterly failed to implement quality-control measures to make sure that all of their foreclosures were being properly maintained.\u201dIn Baton Rouge, La., Gloria Williams lives next door to property No. 8440 in the investigation\u2019s database, a blue-and-white clapboard house that had what seemed to be a jungle out back and boarded-up windows when investigators visited it in 2014.

Or osculation (\u201cthe action of kissing\u201d).Or \u2026 bracketology?What\u2019s an all-American, modern concept like bracketology doing in a dictionary first assembled by Englishmen in the 19th century?Though we may associate the O.E.D. with dusty shelves, it is actually a living document, with thousands of new words and phrases added every year. The latest update, this month, includes terms like Brexit, Defcon, verklempt and soft taco.Some of the new words are sports terms, even American ones.The O.E.D. normally likes to see a word in general use for about a decade before it is enshrined in its august pages, said Katherine Connor Martin, the head of United States dictionaries at Oxford University Press.(Some words become so important that they are fast-tracked, like Brexit, which was also added this month; podcast; and Google used as a verb.)In the case of bracketology, Ms. Martin said, an automated process that scans publications first detected the word\u2019s use in 2002 in The Sporting News. In 2007, it was noticed in The New Yorker by a human being, a \u201cprofessional reader\u201d who combs through all manner of publications looking for new words and usages. In April 2015, a formal suggestion was made to include bracketology in the dictionary.\u201cOnce we decided to do an entry on it, we put it through a whole research process,\u201d Ms. Martin said.The O.E.D. eventually determined that the earliest reference to bracketology came in 2000 in The Montgomery Advertiser. (An even earlier use of the word, in the 1983 book \u201cAncient and Modern Images of Sappho,\u201d had a completely different meaning: the process of adding passages in brackets to a manuscript.)Ms. Martin firmly believes that the word is a worthy inclusion in the O.E.D.\u201cMarch Madness is a huge cultural event in the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a part of American culture.\u201dAlso joining the O.E.D. in 2016 were serve and volley, defensive end (and defensive tackle and defensive back), softballer and O-line.The decision to include a word is made carefully.\u201cWe look at evidence over time,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cYou want to see a range of sources over a long period of time. We like to see a mainstream publication use it without having to explain it.\u201dShe added, \u201cA pattern you\u2019ll see is that it starts somewhere obscure, then makes it way onto the sports pages, then may move on to people who may not even follow the sport.\u201dShe cited Hail Mary, which, after becoming a term for a desperation football pass, soon crossed over and is now used to cite desperation moves in any field.Even faked sports are fodder. In June, the dictionary added kayfabe, defining it as \u201cIn professional wrestling: the fact or convention of presenting staged events, performances, and competitors\u2019 rivalries as if they were authentic or spontaneous.\u201dAs for bracketology, some might see it as a niche activity for die-hard basketball fans. Others may simply see it as pointless. But to Ms. Martin, it\u2019s no less than \u201can important piece of the overall tapestry of American English in the early 21st century.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Cookie Sellers: The Girl Scouts Buff Their Image", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingThe Girl Scouts want you to know there\u2019s more to them than cookies.The list of accomplished Girl Scout alumnae is long \u2014 including the pop star Taylor Swift and the tennis greats Serena and Venus Williams. Michelle Obama, the organization\u2019s honorary president, enhanced its visibility when she hosted a scout campout last year on the South Lawn of the White House. But the venerable organization, about to celebrate its 105th anniversary, is being buffeted by slipping membership numbers, especially among middle-school girls, who can lose interest because of sports, homework and social media.With parents often busy, traditional volunteers also are scarcer. Other girls have left scouting because they wanted more focus on traditional outdoor activities and less on sales of Thin Mints and Samoas.To counter any perception that scouting is out of date, the Girl Scouts are introducing a new marketing campaign that highlights their GIRL initiative \u2014 it stands for go-getters, innovators, risk takers and leaders \u2014 to better define what it has to offer, according to Sylvia Acevedo, the interim chief executive of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the group\u2019s national body.\u201cWe are trying to galvanize our conversation with girls and let them know we are the premier leadership organization for them,\u201d she said.Six years ago, the organization revamped its image for the first time in decades. Old-fashioned badges became less important than experiences, particularly annual cookie sales, which were heralded as teaching money management and other business skills. The cookie program is too vital to Girl Scout finances \u2014 it brings in some $800 million in annual sales \u2014 to be abandoned, but, with a continuing slide in members, planning began more than a year ago to clarify and broaden the organization\u2019s appeal.The new approach includes a peppy contemporary Girl Scout anthem, a public service announcement highlighting the kinds of roles that girls might take on, a digital fund-raising effort targeting small donors and a national gathering to expose more people to the organization.Ms. Acevedo said that the Girl Scouts would also partner with some community-based organizations. The first such partnership is expected to be announced early next year, and it is seen as crucial because of low membership among growing minority populations. Currently the Girl Scouts have 1.8 million members, a drop from 2.1 million three years ago. About two-thirds of scouts are white, according to Girl Scout figures.In an attempt to broaden the organization\u2019s appeal, the Girl Scouts will host a gathering in Columbus, Ohio, in October that will be open to Girl Scouts and to nonmembers. The event, called GIRL 2017, will give girls opportunities to learn about subjects like therapy animals and hear from entrepreneurs about their experiences building businesses.The new approach can entail some risk.\u201cIt can be a big mistake to dilute a brand,\u201d said Americus Reed, professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cSome are attracted because the DNA in a brand like Girl Scouts comes from gender stereotype roles, but others find that a turnoff because they want something more progressive, like coding, for their daughters,\u201d said Mr. Reed, who studies how people identify with, and become loyal to, brands or products.As part of their new marketing campaign, the Girl Scouts issued an \u201cI\u2019m Prepared \u2026 to Lead Like a Girl Scout\u201d public service announcement that is airing nationwide. The 30-second spot, in which girls \u2014 none of whom are in scouting uniforms \u2014 try a variety of activities including playing the guitar and skateboarding, is also on the Girl Scout YouTube channel, its website and its social media accounts.The spot is set to \u201cWatch Me Shine,\u201d a song written for the Girl Scouts by Liz Rose, a Grammy winner, and Emily Shackleton, who sings lead. The anthem, which will be used at official Girl Scout events, is also available on iTunes, Google Play and Amazon music, with part of the proceeds going to the Girl Scouts organization. The point is to appeal to girls in middle school, the age at which scouting can sometimes lose its appeal.\u201cWhen you are 13 or 14, you may not know about the opportunities you can have in scouting and the chance to see older girls be leaders,\u201d Sarah Greichen, 17, of Centennial, Colo., said.\u201cGirl Scouts has really transformed me,\u201d added Ms. Greichen, who started scouts as a 7-year-old Brownie.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to make a phone call to an adult, how to write a business letter or how to speak publicly,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I learned when I created my organization, called Score a Friend; I had to talk to parents, teachers, administrators and school district heads.\u201dThe organization, inspired by her autistic twin brother, has clubs, and a website, to promote inclusiveness by helping students connect with others and make new friends.While Girl Scouts promote the idea that girls should enroll from kindergarten through high school, some in the organization promote some flexibility. Janet Frasier, chief executive of the Girl Scouts of Utah, said the branding overhaul emphasized the scouts\u2019 \u201cbrand essence, which helps us connect more with girls.\u201dBut, as a mother of three teenage girls, Ms. Frasier said that while precollege academic commitments can lead some teenagers to drop scouting, she felt that \u201cwe need to show that Girl Scouts is a way that girls can differentiate themselves on the competitive road to higher education.\u201d\u201cBut even if girls stay only seven or eight years,\u201d she added, \u201cGirl Scouts has provided a foundation for their future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Richards sent four messages in January that said things such as: \u201cYou gonna die. Death is coming to you real soon,\u201d according to an indictment made public on Wednesday.Ms. Richards\u2019s belief \u201cthat the school shooting was a hoax and never happened allegedly motivated her to make the charged threats,\u201d the United States attorney\u2019s office in Miami said in a statement.

Trump plans a technology conference next week with high-profile business executives, many of whom opposed his campaign.\u25a0 The chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent company says many of those jobs at that plant in Indiana will now be lost to automation.\u25a0 Vice President-elect Mike Pence says the national security adviser-designate\u2019s son has nothing to do with the transition, and it appears he no longer does.\u25a0 Mr. Trump, who flies in his own private jet, appears to have ordered the cancellation of the next generation of Air Force One \u2014 via Twitter.President-elect Trump is planning to convene a technology conference next week, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The tech industry was almost universally opposed to Mr. Trump, which might give the meeting a touch of combativeness. His transition team and cabinet posts draw much more heavily from Wall Street than Silicon Valley.There is one major exception: Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump backer who is now in New York helping with the transition. Late last week, David Sacks, the chief executive of Zenefits, said he was stepping down amid conflicting reports that he will be working on the transition as well. Mr. Sacks is a longtime associate of Mr. Thiel.The list of those being invited was not immediately clear, but among those expected are Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google.The president-elect\u2019s move to save 1,100 jobs at a Carrier furnace plant in Indiana has been a political winner, even if it has raised concerns among economists on the left and the right.Now the chief executive of United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent company, says in the end, many of those jobs (he put the figure at 800) likely will fall to automation rather than Mexico.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make up $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we\u2019ll make the capital investments there.\u201dMR. CRAMER: \u201cRight.\u201dMR. HAYES: \u201cBut what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.\u201dHe also confirmed that he feared standing up to the president-elect could be very costly to his conglomerate, which includes a lot of defense work.\u201cThere was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open. At the same time \u2014 and I\u2019ll tell you this because you and I \u2014 we know each other, but I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.\u201dThe president-elect has now taken shots at two American companies by name, Carrier and Boeing, which he suggested on Tuesday \u201cis doing a little bit of a number\u201d with the cost of an Air Force One redesign.That latter hit came after Boeing\u2019s chief executive told The Chicago Tribune he is leery of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies.How is business responding? Very cautiously.In a Business Roundtable conference call Tuesday to release its latest survey of how its members see the economy, Douglas R. Oberhelman, chairman of the business group and the chief executive of Caterpillar, did not criticize the president-elect\u2019s threats to punish companies if they move production abroad.\u201cI think it\u2019s a great dialogue,\u201d he said.Mr. Oberhelman did push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on American manufacturers that export products made overseas back into the United States.\u201cIf he thinks we can negotiate better, then we ought to,\u201d he said. \u201cI do worry about retaliation with a 35 percent tariff or a unilateral action against a trading partner, especially if it\u2019s a big one like China.\u201dVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program, said on Tuesday that the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who posted a baseless fake news story on Twitter on Sunday night, has \u201cno involvement in the transition whatsoever.\u201d And indeed, Mike Flynn Jr. may have been pushed out.The younger Mr. Flynn has sat in on some transition meetings and lists it as part of his biography. Until Monday, he had a transition email and has served as General Flynn\u2019s chief of staff.But on Tuesday, emails to that transition address were bouncing back, and transition spokesman Jason Miller said on a morning conference call that the general\u2019s son is no longer involved.But the senior Flynn has put out conspiracy theories and fake news stories of his own on Twitter:Mr. Pence will speak Tuesday night at a Heritage Foundation event at, where else, the Trump International Hotel in Washington. No word yet what Heritage is paying the Trump Organization for the space.The Morning Consult poll, of course, showed the usual partisan divide. Only 37 percent of Trump voters said the president-elect was going a little heavy on the tweets, while 79 percent of Hillary Clinton voters thought so.Then again, there were considerably more voters for Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump.Regardless, he\u2019s tweeting anyway:It\u2019s war.\u201cElected leaders, they have to be gracious to Trump. That\u2019s not our role,\u201d said David Brock, the driving force behind several pro-Hillary Clinton efforts during the presidential election and the founder of American Bridge.Why American Bridge\u2019s advisers believe that what did not work during the election will suddenly succeed once Mr. Trump becomes president is unclear. During a conference call announcing its plans, an adviser went through the considerable resources the group can bring to bear like tens of thousands of hours of footage of Mr. Trump, an army of researchers digging into his background, a powerful media megaphone.American Bridge and other like-minded groups had all that during the campaign, of course. Asked what difference it all made, Mr. Brock pointed to the small comforts he could take in what was a devastating and unexpected loss: Mr. Trump\u2019s historically low approval ratings, the high share of voters who say a Trump presidency frightens them, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s success with low-income voters.And he added one more. \u201cWe did win the popular vote,\u201d Mr. Brock noted.By a lot \u2014 2,653,958 votes and still rising.Mr. Brock did not mention \u2014 nor was he asked \u2014 whether abolishing the Electoral College would be on American Bridge\u2019s agenda.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said Tuesday that it was \u201cprudent\u201d for President-elect Trump to accept a call from the leader of Taiwan, a move that has been sharply criticized as an affront to China.\u201cI think for him to not take a congratulatory call would in and of itself be considered a snub,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters.Mr. Ryan, who added that he had recently spoken to the Taiwanese president himself during a layover at a Miami airport, declined to comment on the appropriateness of Mr. Trump\u2019s subsequent Twitter posts about the call.\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to sit here and comment on the daily tweets?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not going to do that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we may have had some influence,\u201d Mr. Dole, the former Kansas senator and Republican presidential nominee, said.Christopher Suprun, a Republican elector from Texas, announced in The New York Times on Monday that he would not cast his vote for Mr. Trump when the Electoral College convenes \u2014 and a group of academics and lawyers are trying to coax more \u201cfaithless\u201d electors to follow suit.The United States was set up as a republic. Alexander Hamilton provided a blueprint for states\u2019 votes. Federalist 68 argued that an Electoral College should determine if candidates are qualified, not engaged in demagogy, and independent from foreign influence. Mr. Trump shows us again and again that he does not meet these standards. Given his own public statements, it isn\u2019t clear how the Electoral College can ignore these issues, and so it should reject him.To give encouragement, and legal support, the Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig and the law firm Durie Tangri have teamed up to start what they are calling the Electors Trust, offering free counsel to other electors pondering Mr. Suprun\u2019s route.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a CNBC commentator.

{"Headline": "Forget AT&T. The Real Monopolies Are Google and Facebook.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner has drawn censure from both sides of the political aisle, as well as a Senate hearing that looked into the potential for the combined company to become a monopoly.But if we are going to examine media monopolies, we should look first at Silicon Valley, not the fading phone business.Mark Cuban, the internet entrepreneur, said at the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last week that the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.\u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Look at the numbers. Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Facebook are among the 10 largest companies in the world. Alphabet alone has a market capitalization of around $550 billion. AT&T and Time Warner combined would be about $300 billion.Alphabet has an 83 percent share of the mobile search market in the United States and just under 63 percent of the US mobile phone operating systems market. AT&T has a 32 percent market share in mobile phones and 26 percent in pay TV. The combined AT&T-Time Warner will have $8 billion in cash but $171 billion of net debt, according to the research company MoffettNathanson. Compare that to Alphabet\u2019s balance sheet, with total cash of $76 billion and total debt of about $3.94 billion.In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, according to Brian Nowak, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.Google and Facebook can achieve huge net profit margins because they dominate the content made available on the web while making very little of it themselves. Instead, they both have built their advertising businesses as \u201cfree riders\u201d on content made by others, some of it from Time Warner. The rise of these digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries of our country.Every pirated music video or song posted on YouTube or Facebook robs the creators of income, and YouTube in particular is dominated by unlicensed content. Google\u2019s YouTube has an over 55 percent market share in the streaming audio business and yet provides less than 11 percent of the streaming audio revenues to the content owners and creators. But Facebook, which refuses to enter into any licensing agreement on music or video, is challenging YouTube in the free online video and music world.In the past decade, an enormous reallocation of revenue of perhaps $50 billion a year has taken place, with economic value moving from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms.I reached this conclusion from the following statistics: Since 2000, recorded music revenues in the United States have fallen to $7.2 billion per year from $19.8 billion. Home entertainment video revenue fell to $18 billion in 2014 from $24.2 billion in 2006. United States newspaper ad revenue fell to $23.6 billion in 2013 from $65.8 billion in 2000.And yet, by every available metric, people are consuming more music, video, news and books. During that same period, Google\u2019s revenue grew to $74.5 billion from $400 million.The former editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, estimated that Facebook had \u201csucked up $27 million\u201d of the paper\u2019s projected digital advertising revenue in the last year by essentially keeping Guardian readers on Facebook, rather than linking them to the Guardian site.\u201cThey are taking all the money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey have algorithms we don\u2019t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it.\u201dBut the problem isn\u2019t just for musicians, authors, filmmakers or even the phone company. As the former Google \u201cdesign ethicist\u201d Tristan Harris wrote, \u201cIf you control the menu, you control the choices.\u201dWe have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the menu (Google\u2019s search rankings and Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed). How that menu is determined by these black box algorithms isn\u2019t known by anyone outside those companies. As more and more of our lives become digital, these new algorithms will assume more power over our lives.Regulators should take a hard look at the merger between AT&T and Time Warner. After the hearing on Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee, suggested that what was needed were hearings that would also include Alphabet and Facebook. She\u2019s right.But in some ways, that\u2019s just fighting the last war. We have gone through a long election cycle without any discussion about the unregulated world now dominated by a few Silicon Valley giants. Perhaps in January we can have an honest national conversation on monopoly and our future.Advertisement"}

Sadly, this week\u2019s \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d proved unable to maintain this delicate act: It has a riveting A Story, but a labored B Story and an unimportant and mawkish C Story. The resulting episode contains flashes of brilliance, but overall is clumsy and unbalanced.Instead, the show opts to spend too much time with its ridiculous C Story about the paternity test. While Jason\u2019s entire life is being ripped apart by blackmail, the camera keeps cutting back to a father and son deciding whether or not to open an envelope. But while the paternity results themselves are hardly worth discussing, the thread does redeem itself in part by engaging in another worthy exploration of the relationship between president and press. Seth Wright thinks he killed the story by cozying up to the reporter Lisa Jordan and offering her a different morsel, but she has principles: \u201cThe president\u2019s relationship with the truth means something,\u201d she tells him, in a thinly veiled subtweet.In another era of American politics, the show might have had to prove its daring by taking a stand on some hot-button political issue. Here, it is enough to champion basic notions like truth, free speech and an active press. \u201cI believe our country is only as strong as our journalists,\u201d President Kirkman tells Lisa. \u201cI expect you to keep us honest.\u201dThe B Story, which follows a ricin scare that threatens the nation\u2019s first congressional elections since the Capitol attack, makes a similarly principled argument for the necessity of free and fair elections. Poll workers are praised for their contribution to democracy; voter suppression is condemned as treason; the election is eventually celebrated as a sacred cornerstone of the nation. Such arguments are particularly poignant now, but from a narrative perspective, the whole subplot feels manufactured. The White House\u2019s efforts to chase down the bioterrorist seem like a tired MacGuffin that distracts from the more intriguing characters and plot developments.Two fairly major reveals arrive at the end of the episode: that Congresswoman Hookstraten fancies herself a Machiavellian schemer and plans to take down the Kirkman presidency, and that MacLeish, as expected, is in the pocket of the enemy but growing weary. With Catalan now lurking at the edge of every shot, though, these two don\u2019t scare me nearly as much as they used to.Stray NotesAdvertisement"}

It took him about a second.\u201cIt was that little white dot that blew things up,\u201d Mr. Valena, 36, said recently. \u201cThe phone started ringing off the hook. Talk about God\u2019s grace.\u201dMr. Valena once thought he had to choose between his love for tattoos and his love of God. But in this case, his good fortune may have more to do with another all-powerful force in the universe: the Kardashian-Jenner family. The finger that Mr. Valena tattooed belonged to Kendall Jenner, a model and younger sister of Kim Kardashian.His trademark style is single-needle, fine-line tattooing, what his fans simply call tiny tattoos: hearts and flowers and city skylines etched in black ink and shrunken to emoji size; the names of loved ones and inspirational mantras rendered in his squiggly, miniature cursive.Many tattoo artists don\u2019t like doing little tattoos because they are difficult to apply and can rub away. But Mr. Valena, sensing an attractive market, has made them his specialty. He is a favorite of models and actresses, who appreciate the delicacy and near-invisibility of his work.Ms. Richie, who described herself as \u201cnot the kind of person to have tattoos,\u201d said that Mr. Valena\u2019s etchings are nevertheless feminine and artistic, and that he\u2019s a gentleman. \u201cThe first time I got tattooed by him we hung out for hours,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made it an easy process where I felt relaxed.\u201d\u201cI feel blessed,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people out there that can do the same thing I do, even better. It just so happens that I got to tattoo some famous people.\u201dStill, for all his accomplishments, Mr. Valena said at times he has struggled with his professional and life choices. Tattoo artist to the stars was not his original calling. He planned to join the ministry.\u201cThere\u2019s almost that guilt of, you were going to be a youth pastor,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cI fell away from church, and I really just wrestled with it. Just feeling, like, \u2018Man, where am I?\u2019\u201dMr. Valena, who described himself as \u201ca little Filipino guy,\u201d sat cross-legged on a chair. He wore black shorts and a black T-shirt that revealed heavily inked arms and legs, and a black trucker hat that made him a few inches taller. His tattooed hands were weighted by two fistfuls of chunky gold rings by Gucci and Versace.\u201cI\u2019ve always loved fashion,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cAnd now living in New York City and being part of it is just a dream.\u201dOn a break between appointments, Mr. Valena reflected earnestly on his life\u2019s journey so far. There was a God-saved-my-wretched-soul aspect to his storytelling, an emphasis on redemptive moments.The first came when Mr. Valena, who was raised outside Chicago in a divorced family, said he had a near-fatal drug overdose at 17. He embraced Christianity and enrolled at a Bible college in Rhode Island. Two years later, he found himself working as a youth pastor and church coffeehouse barista in Decorah, Iowa, population 8,000.\u201cIt was a college town, there were a handful of things to do, but it got old,\u201d Mr. Valena said.He had a few tattoos already, and was interested in the art form. He started hanging out at a local parlor, Valhalla Tattoo and Piercing, run by a mullet-haired Irish biker and ex-con who taught him the ropes.\u201cYes, I had to start by doing grapefruits,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cBut the feeling you get when you have that vibrating piece of machinery in your hand and you\u2019re creating something permanent on someone\u2019s body \u2014 it started there.\u201dSome church leaders thought he was doing the devil\u2019s work. There was pressure put on him to quit tattooing, he said. Instead, Mr. Valena quit the church and honed his craft at biker rallies throughout the Midwest.In short order, he followed a girl to Wisconsin and then Minneapolis, married, fathered a son, became a successful local tattooer, grew restless, had an affair, got divorced and made an impulsive leap with his young mistress to New York City, where he had trouble acclimating and became \u201cthe insecure JonBoy who is rarely tattooing because I had no clientele out here.\u201dAfter an altercation in the subway with a romantic rival, he was arrested and jailed, Mr. Valena said, prompting a dark night of the soul. \u201cI felt, man, I failed at everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI failed my marriage. I failed my family. I\u2019m failing this relationship here. I\u2019m failing in New York City. I failed becoming a youth pastor. I felt lost.\u201dA few years ago, Mr. Valena was so desperate for work that he took a job tattooing at a nightclub in the meatpacking district while drunk people cavorted around him. Now he sets his own schedule, sees as many as eight clients a day and charges a minimum of $300 an hour.Mr. Valena held out the crowded canvas of his arms, showing the spot where Kylie Jenner inked a tiny K with a crown and Ireland Baldwin tattooed a wobbly-looking \u201cL.A.\u201d\u201cAnd Chlo\u00eb Moretz \u2014 she\u2019s, like, \u2018I\u2019m really good at doing stick figures with big penises,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valena added. He shrugged. \u201cI give them liberty. When Hailey or Kylie come in here, I want to remember those times.\u201dSoon Ms. Gadecki arrived with hugs, accompanied by her parents and her leather-jacket-wearing boyfriend. She wanted a tiny \u201cR,\u201d her father\u2019s first initial, behind her ear, which would be her third JonBoy tattoo (like Happy Meal trinkets, tiny tattoos encourage a collection).Ms. Gadecki, who also belongs to Hillsong, was referred to Mr. Valena by a friend after an unpleasant experience with another tattoo artist. \u201cI felt like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do it.\u2019 JonBoy listened. He realized it\u2019s important to me.\u201dAfter the letter design was agreed to, Mr. Valena began placing the stencil onto Ms. Gadecki\u2019s skin. He stopped abruptly because he wasn\u2019t feeling the music. \u201cI need a new song!\u201d he yelled, then ran to the front desk, cued up a track by Mr. Bieber and returned to his work, singing.\u201cI never thought it would be like this,\u201d Mr. Valena said. \u201cI never thought putting a little white dot on Kendall Jenner would come to this. I\u2019m living the dream.\u201dAnd what of his planned career as a youth pastor? Is his soul still divided?He answered, sounding at peace, \u201cYou have a path and a journey, and your life is going to take you where it\u2019s supposed to take you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Defies California Regulators With Self-Driving Car Service", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byFor seven years, Uber\u2019s stance on complying with regulations has been consistent: Ask forgiveness, not permission.The dispute is rooted in Uber\u2019s refusal to seek a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which would allow it to test autonomous vehicles under certain conditions. Companies like Google, Tesla Motors and Mercedes-Benz have all gotten such permits.Uber officials contend that under the letter of California law, the company does not need a permit because the motor vehicles department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive \u201cwithout the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\u201d Uber said its modified, self-driving Volvo XC90s require human oversight, and therefore do not fit California\u2019s definition of an autonomous vehicle.\u201cThis rule just doesn\u2019t apply to us,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, vice president of Uber\u2019s advanced technologies group, said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear a belt and suspenders and whatever else if you\u2019re wearing a dress.\u201dThe motor vehicles department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in a letter to Uber on Friday, lawyers in the California attorney general\u2019s office reiterated the state\u2019s position that the company pull the self-cars off the road until it got the permits or face unspecified consequences.Uber argues the way its technology is used differs little from the way Tesla Motors, the electric carmaker founded by Elon Musk, uses its technology. Tesla offers a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, which gives drivers the ability to \u201cmatch speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.As of Dec. 8, Tesla held a permit in California for autonomous-vehicle testing. Uber said that permit did not apply to the wider commercial use of self-driving cars bought by consumers, and that the motor vehicle department\u2019s decision-making process should be consistent across the types of vehicles on the road.\u201cIt\u2019s an important issue of principle about when companies can operate self-driving cars on the roads and the uneven application of statewide rules across very similar types of technology,\u201d Mr. Levandowski said.A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Says It Will Run Entirely on Renewable Energy in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byMINCO, Okla. \u2014 Last year, Google consumed as much energy as the city of San Francisco. Next year, it said, all of that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels.The online giant said on Tuesday that all of its data centers around the world will be entirely powered with renewable energy sources sometime next year.This is not to say that Google computers will consume nothing but wind and solar power. Like almost any company, Google gets power from a power company, which operates an energy grid typically supplied by a number of sources, including hydroelectric dams, natural gas, coal and wind power.What Google has done over the last decade, with relatively little fanfare, is participate in a number of large-scale deals with renewable producers, typically guaranteeing to buy the energy they produce with their wind turbines and solar cells. With those guarantees, wind companies can obtain bank financing to build more turbines.The power created by the renewables is plugged into the utility grid, so that Google\u2019s usage presents no net consumption of fossil fuels and the pool of electricity gets a relatively larger share of renewable sources.\u201cWe are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world,\u201d said Joe Kava, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, good for business and good for our shareholders.\u201dUnlike carbon-based power, Mr. Kava said, wind supply prices do not fluctuate, enabling Google to plan better. In addition, the more renewable energy it buys, the cheaper those sources get. In some places, like Chile, Google said, renewables have at times become cheaper than fossil fuels.Whether Google is the largest buyer of renewables would be difficult to verify, as many industries do not release data on how much energy they consume. There is no doubt, however, that Google\u2019s large computer complexes, along with similar global operations by Amazon and Microsoft, are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing new consumers of electricity.Google hopes that success in working with large wind farms, like the 50,000-acre facility in Minco, Okla., which supplies Google\u2019s large data center in Pryor, Okla., will spur development of the industry. NextEra Energy, which owns the wind farm, has about 115 wind farms in the United States and Canada.About 25 percent of United States electricity goes to businesses, and companies like Google are now about 2 percentage points of that. Dominion Virginia Power, located in a state with perhaps the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, last year had a demand increase from those customers of 9 percent, while overall demand was nearly flat, according to Dominion.Google operates eight different businesses, including internet search engines, YouTube and Gmail, each of which has over 1 billion customers. They run on a global network of 13 large-scale data centers, each one a complex of many buildings containing hundreds of thousands of computers.The 5.7 terawatt-hours of electricity Google consumed in 2015 \u201cis equal to the output of two 500 megawatt coal plants,\u201d said Jonathan Koomey, a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences at Stanford. That is enough for two 140,000-person towns. \u201cFor one company to be doing this is a very big deal. It means other companies of a similar scale will feel pressure to move.\u201dIt moves the needle on costs to have a big consumer, Mr. Koomey added, since a larger market tends to allow for economies of scale and more innovation. \u201cEvery time you double production, you reduce the cost of solar by about 20 percent. Wind goes down 10 to 12 percent,\u201d he said.Facebook has entered into similar deals with wind producers. Last week, Amazon reiterated its long-term commitment to power its machines entirely with renewable energy, though for 2016 it expects to be above about 40 percent of its goal. It has announced five more solar projects.Microsoft says it has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2014, but much of this comes from the purchase of carbon offsets, which are investments in things like tree planting or renewables projects meant to compensate for the fossil fuels a company consumes. The company hopes to have half of its electric power supplied from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources by 2018. Its data centers currently use about 3.3 million megawatt-hours of power a year.Critics note that while Google might be adding wind and solar to the world\u2019s power grid, overall it is still dependent on fossil fuels, since sun and wind power are intermittent, while demand for things like YouTube cat videos is continual.\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s a P.R. gimmick,\u201d said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank in Washington supported largely by donations from individuals and companies in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf they think they can actually support themselves with wind and solar panels, they should connect them directly to their data centers.\u201dNext year\u2019s goal will be 95 percent accomplished with wind turbines around the world, Mr. Kava said, and Google\u2019s support for the industry could keep prices dropping, particularly relative to things like coal. \u201cWe\u2019re technology-agnostic, but we\u2019re not price-agnostic,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated title for Jonathan Koomey at Stanford. He is a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences, not a research fellow at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.Advertisement"}

She gave them out to friends with instructions to use the combination for self-care.The term self-care has, over the past few years, become part of the vernacular. But what does it mean? \u201cI always say it\u2019s a daily practice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be: making sure you get enough sleep and drink enough water, monthly facials, fermented foods, a meditation app for your phone or packing healthy snacks for the plane.\u201dIn recent weeks, though, self-care has often been invoked as a way of dealing with open-ended anxiety.On Nov. 18, the Clover newsletter, which is aimed at teenagers, published \u201cHow to Pull Yourself Back Up When You\u2019re Feeling Down\u201d with \u201cSelf-care sounds like one of those lame new-agey terms that people toss around, but it\u2019s actually important, especially now!\u201dThe singling out of self-care as a concept is hardly recent. In 1976, the French philosopher Michel Foucault, in his treatise \u201cThe Care of the Self,\u201d wrote that \u201cthe idea that one ought to attend to oneself, care for oneself\u201d was a theme in the classical world and a practice that conditions one to care for others.Self-care has long had political undertones, primarily pertaining to activist burnout, said Yashna Padamsee, who works for the National Domestic Workers Alliance and has written about the term. \u201cAudre Lorde\u2019s quote refers back to an act of preservation and act of survival for people at the margins,\u201d Ms. Padamsee said. \u201cSelf-care is an act of shoring up and resourcing ourselves to bring a stronger self to the movement. That\u2019s the school of thought I come from.\u201dSo what is the difference between self-care and simply pampering? \u201cThere is a distinction between self-care and treating yourself,\u201d Ms. Padamsee said. \u201cWhat is the purpose of your self-care? Is it to do this for all of our lives, not just yours?\u201dMatthew Gardner, a founder of the TriBeCa-based creative agency Highfield, said he could imagine companies co-opting the idea soon enough. \u201cBrands and agencies still work with ideas that have been thoroughly run into the ground,\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \u201cThen they wait six months. Then they butcher them. So maybe a fast casual salad chain will come out with a mini-campaign encouraging people to \u2018show us how you #CareForYourself.\u2019\u201dAt Indiana University, one professor is trying to combine activism and pampering. A week after the election, Jeanne Vaccaro, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of gender studies, handed out phone numbers to students to call their political representatives. \u201cI said, \u2018If you haven\u2019t had a chance to do these things, I\u2019m giving you this dedicated time,\u2019\u201d Ms. Vaccaro said. \u201cI think self-help these days is more about providing a collective scene to hold the chaos rather than going off into a quiet corner to decompress.\u201dNot that she is avoiding her own needs. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to art events constantly,\u201d she said. \u201cNot as a way to pretend that nothing is going on, but to be around people who are imaginative and creative, getting takeout Burmese food from this place by my house.

{"Headline": "4 Trailers That Have Us Excited for 2017", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byA new year brings new movies, of course, but their promotion has already begun. With a full slate of films headed to the big screen in the next few months, here\u2019s a look at notable trailers.Otherwise, \u201cFifty Shades Darker\u201d seems to take everything people liked and loathed about \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d and double it. Meaningful glances are everywhere. Some scenes in the trailer are a little more suggestive, though there might be a public indecency law broken in one of them. Even the wooden dialogue is back. (Although perhaps more self-aware; the first line of the trailer, \u201cI want you back,\u201d feels like a plea from the producers.)Even the music is the same. The trailer for \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d was set to a slower, spookier remix of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy in Love.\u201d Not to be outdone, this trailer brings in the R&B star Miguel for a breathy, hauntingly sexy cover that\u2019s just distinct enough to merit notice.And hey, why not? The music worked last time.Not the trailer for \u201cLogan,\u201d released in October, which sweeps all mentions of X-Men or Wolverine under the rug.Instead, it suggests a post-apocalyptic western. Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of \u201cHurt,\u201d a song about pain, provides the through line, connecting all the shots of a weary, older Mr. Jackman. The once-invulnerable Logan is shown alone, backed by dusty deserts and rusting equipment. He\u2019s battered, bloodied and wizened. It\u2019s Wolverine, by way of Clint Eastwood.The trailer positions Logan as a Wild West outlaw, making a break from the superhero genre. When antagonists appear, they arrive in a caravan of police cars. One character even wears a cowboy hat and poncho. So by the time Logan finally unsheathes his claws, toward the trailer\u2019s end, it\u2019s a jarring tonal break from what seems like a quieter, smaller film.April 28After that, Mae attends a keynote address delivered by a Circle leader, played by Tom Hanks, who stands in front of the company logo and wears a dark sweater that looks like the love child of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s hoodies and Steve Jobs\u2019s classic turtlenecks. He speaks about the power of technology, luring us in with his \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d voice, while Mae and her colleagues attend meetings and take selfies. \u201cSharing is caring,\u201d they chant emphatically. It\u2019s a sharp contrast from a real-world discussion about whether that\u2019s actually true. (Oh, hey, don\u2019t forget to share this column on Facebook!)The dark turn is inevitable, even without our current conversation about technology in 2016. So the trailer adds to the drama with a slowed- and stripped-down cover of the Hall & Oates song \u201cPrivate Eyes.\u201d A voice chants over piano, \u201cThey\u2019re watching you,\u201d drawing audiences further in with a foreboding warning about both the story onscreen and what might be happening off.The \u201cSnatched\u201d trailer, released in December, finds the right balance. It\u2019s certainly joke-dense. From the start, it establishes Ms. Schumer\u2019s character in an embarrassing breakup scene that brings her comedy chops to the forefront. Then it zips along to her mother\u2019s home, where Ms. Hawn awkwardly comforts Ms. Schumer with a hug that immediately establishes the uneasiness in their relationship. The trailer ushers them to South America with a quick conversation that further explains who they are: a young woman trying to find herself and a mother mired in routine.As the trailer introduces more plot elements \u2014 a man, the titular snatching, the escape \u2014 it keeps the jokes coming with a remarkable narrative economy. Plus, it gives equal time to Ms. Schumer and Ms. Hawn, suggesting both women will be making memorable returns to the big screen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Problem for Democratic Leaders Is Democratic Voters", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byLeaders on the Democratic left who want to represent the have-nots face an obstacle: their own voters.Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, argues that Democrats \u201chave to stand for a strong, populist economic message.\u201d He warns that \u201cthe way the working class is always controlled is that it\u2019s divided.\u201dA key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship, Senator Bernie Sanders, believes thatDemocrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country.a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.The problem facing Ellison, Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic electorate has actually become less receptive to populism over the past two decades.Mark Muro, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinton and those that backed Donald Trump. The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect.The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America\u2019s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015.In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection.Muro enlarged on his findings in an email:These industries encompass the nation\u2019s \u201ctech\u201d sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country\u2019s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth.The importance of these industries does not stop there:The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It\u2019s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people \u2014 those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they\u2019re going to make ends meet.Ellison\u2019s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial.In other words, as Muro made clear in his email:shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties.From 2009 to October 2016, Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm pro-trade stance, 48-37, 11 points in favor, to a decisively pro-trade position, 56-31. The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders.Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24.If anything, Trump\u2019s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade.This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas \u2014 in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.Among Democrats during this same period, Putin\u2019s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62.An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails.In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years.Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month.Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email,the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains.In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact \u2014 shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped.Although Trump\u2019s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters.Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party\u2019s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective.An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, \u201cRecent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,\u201d shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off.The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call \u201cskill downsizing.\u201d Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained.Despite Trump\u2019s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes \u2014 imports plus exports \u2014 have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent.Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreementsare not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they\u2019re about setting expansive \u201crules of the road\u201d that determine who wins and who loses.The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process:With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the \u2018winners\u2019 under these rules.Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party\u2019s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies \u2014 including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing.Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status.The nation\u2019s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks \u2014 and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation\u2019s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With LinkedIn, Microsoft Looks to Avoid Past Acquisition Busts", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byThere are ample reasons to be skeptical that the deal, the biggest by far in Microsoft\u2019s history, will pay off.First, the company has not had a great track record with this sort of thing. Two of Microsoft\u2019s largest acquisitions \u2014 the digital advertising firm aQuantive and the mobile unit of Nokia \u2014 were disappointments that eventually led to the company writing off nearly the entire value of the deals, more than $13 billion in all.\u201cMergers go on anyway, even though there\u2019s not much evidence they work out,\u201d said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cEverybody believes they are going to be different.\u201dStill, the Microsoft of 2016 is different from the unfocused giant of the past that lurched from deal to deal with wild-eyed ambitions of catching rivals like Google and Apple. It has a new chief executive who has made a series of smaller deals that have shown positive results. The company\u2019s stock is trading at record highs.In a joint interview shortly before their deal closed, Satya Nadella and Jeff Weiner, the chiefs of Microsoft and LinkedIn, described how they intended to make the acquisition work, where many before had failed. \u201cIn this case, this is the most substantial, big M&A that Microsoft has done in its history,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cSo the stakes are absolutely high.\u201dA key difference in the way Microsoft has approached the deal is the degree of independence it plans to give LinkedIn. It will not weave LinkedIn, which is based in Silicon Valley, into one of its existing product lines, nor will it treat it like a disconnected business. Mr. Weiner will remain LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive.\u201cNeither one of us is a Pollyanna,\u201d said Mr. Weiner. \u201cWe both know that acquisition integrations are challenging.\u201d\u201cI absolutely think of LinkedIn as our Instagram,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.Both men said that expanding the business of LinkedIn, which has more 470 million members, was what they cared most about. Microsoft will use its sales and distribution muscle to do just that.The company\u2019s executives on Thursday will outline plans to integrate the professional identity people have on LinkedIn with Microsoft Outlook and the rest of the Office suite. LinkedIn members will be able to draft r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in Word to update their LinkedIn profiles.\u201cSatya said starting literally on Day 1 the first priority is growing LinkedIn,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cThat if LinkedIn continues to grow its membership, if it continues to realize its mission, its vision, if it continues to grow the business, that\u2019s going to create value for Microsoft.\u201d\u201cI had to read it at least twice,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cI did a bit of a double take.\u201dMicrosoft and LinkedIn have spent much of the last six months \u2014 as the proposed deal went through regulatory reviews \u2014 getting to know each other.In a series of meetings the companies called \u201clearning days,\u201d teams of Microsoft employees from the Seattle area flew to LinkedIn\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley to talk about what\u2019s going on with Microsoft research, engineers, sales and other areas. LinkedIn employees flew to Microsoft to do the same.About 10,000 LinkedIn employees will join Microsoft. David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has done studies on LinkedIn and Microsoft, said one of the greatest challenges in making the deal work would be retaining talent.\u201cCritical in any merger of this type is, it\u2019s made a lot of people very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they stay?\u201dMr. Weiner, for one, said he was committed to LinkedIn.\u201cI\u2019m in my dream job, and the combination with Microsoft provides that much more opportunity to realize what it is we set out to do here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s plan to deport immigrants in the country illegally.Most are immigrants and an unknown share are undocumented, researchers say.A new proposal would create a permit system for the vendors, regulate where they can set up their carts and require them to abide by health codes long enforced at their brick-and-mortar counterparts.The plan was advanced by a City Council committee on Monday. It is set to go before the full Council early next year.Parts of the proposal have pleased business owners who have traditionally been wary about what legalized sidewalk vending would mean for them. Notably, it calls for a limit of two vendors per block.But some are also skeptical such a rule would be enforced.\u201cAll of this is fine and good if you\u2019ve got enforcement,\u201d he added. \u201cI have no confidence that will happen.\u201dBoth sides in the debate acknowledge that the system now is broken.Mr. Vallianatos said the moment appeared ripe to fix it. He cited the political power of the city\u2019s rising Latino population, a growing embrace of urban walkable spaces, and, of course, Mr. Trump.\u201cTo me it\u2019s kind of embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Vallianatos said. \u201cTo have us be the standout in the country with no possibility for legal vending is a betrayal.\u201dWe\u2019re trying something new: reader photos.From time to time, we\u2019ll publish your images of beautiful or interesting places in California.To start things off, Carl Larson, an amateur photographer in Los Angeles, shared this image of a burst of color over the city\u2019s skyline. To create the panorama, he captured five side-by-side images, then stitched them together using editing software.Mr. Larson said he hiked a trail behind Griffith Observatory, the domed structure to the left, to take pictures of the sunset on Nov. 7.\u201cIt was a little smoggy out and low-lying clouds and the sky just absolutely lit up,\u201d he said.And if the cosmos weren\u2019t enough, the observatory\u2019s perch on the southern slope of Mount Hollywood also has one of the best views of Los Angeles.Stay tuned for instructions on how you can submit a photo for possible publication.

Twenty manufacturers have already obtained permits to test hundreds of cars on California roads. Uber shall do the same.\u201dNonetheless, as recently as Friday, Uber remained defiant. It said that it had no intention of ending its test and that its self-driving cars were still on the road and picking up passengers.Uber officials contended that under the letter of California law, the company did not need a permit because the Motor Vehicles Department defined autonomous vehicles as those that drive \u201cwithout the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\u201dUber said its modified, self-driving Volvo XC90s required human oversight, and therefore did not fit California\u2019s definition of an autonomous vehicle. Companies such as Google and Tesla Motors have all gotten such permits.\u201cThis rule just doesn\u2019t apply to us,\u201d Anthony Levandowski, vice president of Uber\u2019s advanced technologies group, said in a conference call with reporters last week. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear a belt and suspenders and whatever else if you\u2019re wearing a dress.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
