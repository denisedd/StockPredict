{"Headline": "When Trump Meets Tech Leaders, Jobs Will Be on the Agenda", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOther topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post \u2014 a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election \u2014 tweeted his congratulations. \u201cI for one give him my most open mind,\u201d he said.Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. \u201cI plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d she said in a statement.And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon.\u201cIt was a good time,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cWe had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They added they were discussing other ways \u201cto prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.\u201dThrough the coalition, technology companies will use \u201chashes,\u201d or what they describe as \u201cunique digital fingerprints,\u201d to identify terrorist imagery and videos uploaded to their services.So if a Twitter post with a terrorist image is identified, hashed and added to the database, Facebook can use that identifier to check to see if that content appears on its network. If it has, Facebook can remove that piece of content from its site if it chooses to do so.Technology companies generally remove content that has been flagged as inappropriate or a violation of their terms of service. Each company will ultimately have discretion over what content it removes from its own network. No personally identifiable information will be stored in the database. The group said it planned to be open to other companies joining the effort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Sharpen Focus on Social and Environmental Risks to Stocks", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byPfizer stock was riding high in June 2015, up 128 percent in five years, making it the second-most valuable American drug maker. Nine out of 10 Wall Street research analysts recommended that investors hold it in their portfolio, if not buy more.That same month, however, a different type of research firm downgraded Pfizer to its lowest rating, reflecting what it considered increased risks from factors that other Wall Street analysts typically ignore: environmental, social and corporate governance issues, or E.S.G.Investing based on so-called E.S.G. factors has mushroomed in recent years, driven in part by big pension funds and European money managers that are trying new ways to evaluate potential investments. The idea has changed over the last three decades from managers\u2019 simple exclusion from their portfolios of \u201csin stocks\u201d such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms makers to incorporation of E.S.G. analysis into their stock and bond picks.MSCI is perhaps better known for its global stock indexes, but its annual E.S.G. index and research revenues have been growing at 20 percent annually and should top $44 million this year, making the segment the firm\u2019s fastest-growing business.On Pfizer, MSCI\u2019s research noted the high volume of regulatory warnings that the company had received as of mid-2015, raising the risk of liability concerning five of its drugs. The downgrade caught Pfizer\u2019s attention, and its representatives met with MSCI officials to update them on legal issues like asbestos lawsuits, and about various drugs like Zoloft, Effexor and Protonix. MSCI kept its rating.The amount of assets managed using E.S.G. factors has more than tripled to $8.1 trillion since 2010, according to a report issued in November by the US SIF Foundation, which tracks sustainable investing. The TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund has doubled in size to a current $2.3 billion in the last five years. Exchange-traded funds linked to MSCI E.S.G. indexes have tripled to $3 billion in the last three years. And there has been a proliferation of E.S.G. index or research providers, including FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices and Sustainalytics, which helps Morningstar rate mutual funds on their E.S.G. factors.Surveys have shown that younger investors like the approach. Calls for fossil-fuel divestment linked to climate-change concerns have also raised awareness. Even the regulatory climate has shifted: The Department of Labor ruled last year that investing fiduciaries could consider E.S.G. factors in their investment decisions as long as they did not hurt expected returns.Lisa Woll, chief executive of US SIF, said that even if a Trump administration \u201crolls back progress\u201d on some environmental and social issues, the field over all \u201cis likely to continue to grow based on demand by a wide range of investors.\u201dAssembled through acquisitions between 2009 and 2014, the MSCI E.S.G. ratings \u201chave come to be the market standard for E.S.G.,\u201d said Amy Orr, the director of capital markets at the Heron Foundation, which pursues an anti-poverty mission.On a recent morning last month, standing before a computer screen elevated by black metal stilts for videoconferencing, Ms. Lee conducted calls with MSCI analysts in Mumbai, Tokyo, Beijing and Massachusetts to consider a few possible ratings changes.They first considered whether a Chinese steel company, Fosun International, should be upgraded because it was moving into financial services and would have lower exposure to toxic emissions. \u201cWe approve, including the rating upgrade. Thanks, Xiaoshu,\u201d Ms. Lee said to her analyst.Next was a downgrade of ENN Energy Holdings, a natural gas pipeline distributor in China that had carbon emission issues and what a utility analyst in Tokyo, Kenji Watanabe, called a \u201cweak board composition.\u201d But a downgrade was deferred for Bollor\u00e9 S.A. \u2014 a French transportation company that recently had a rail accident that killed 79 in Cameroon \u2014 pending an MSCI effort to reach the company.The MSCI ratings do not exclude all stocks in any given category, such as fossil fuels or tobacco, but rather rank each company against its peers based on how it manages E.S.G. risks.In oil and gas, for example, the Norwegian giant Statoil ranks near the top based partly on its record of spills and low emissions, while the American company Chevron ranks near the bottom with higher-risk operations, including forced shutdowns this year of a new $54 billion liquefied natural gas plant in Australia.The building blocks for MSCI\u2019s E.S.G. research came from acquisitions that included a governance ratings firm co-founded by Robert Monks, a pioneer in shareholder activism, and a socially responsible stock research firm, KLD Research & Analytics, which introduced the Domini 400 Social Index in 1990.The goal, Mr. Monks said in a recent interview, is to \u201capply something akin to classical security analysis to areas which have so far escaped consideration in valuing companies.\u201dPerformance does not have to suffer. Although the TIAA-CREF social choice fund and the flagship MSCI exchange-traded fund have trailed the market slightly for the last five years, the Vanguard fund has topped it. The $14.8 billion Parnassus Core Equity Investor fund, which picks stocks using E.S.G. and fundamental analysis, has beaten the market by more than two percentage points annually over the last 10 years.As E.S.G. becomes more popular, companies have become more responsive to MSCI\u2019s data-gathering efforts. Ms. Lee said the response rate had risen from about 15 percent in 2013 to a current 40 percent. Pfizer, for example, first got in touch with MSCI in 2014.The TIAA-CREF social choice fund, which aims to invest in E.S.G. leaders, does not hold several well-known stocks based partly on unfavorable MSCI ratings. Among those excluded are Exxon Mobil (for environmental impact management), Apple (labor-management relations and supply chain issues), Facebook (privacy and data security), Amazon (labor-management practices), and General Electric (labor-management practices, military contracting, weapons).With undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard, Ms. Lee came to MSCI through the 2010 acquisition of RiskMetrics Group, owner of the Innovest sustainability research firm. Operating from a 48th-floor glass-walled aerie opposite One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, she oversees 150 analysts who follow 6,500 companies in 14 offices worldwide.Some investors find data from MSCI and others helpful as a starting point beyond the narrower E.S.G. agenda. \u201cIt really helps us quickly understand whether there are business controversies or other risks \u2014 and opportunities,\u201d said Karina Funk, a co-manager of the $360 million Brown Advisory Sustainable Growth fund.For example, she said, her firm bought stock in American Tower, a cellular tower company, after Brown\u2019s own research found its tower-siting practices exceed standards set by environmental regulators or wildlife management groups, \u201cmaking them a preferred partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Gadget Apocalypse Is Upon Us", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtRemember gadgets?They were little electronic things that did stuff for you. They would play music or record videos or give you directions or let you play games on the go. They were fun. Everyone had them. Everyone wanted them. There were whole magazines and websites and even TV shows devoted to them.For 30 or 40 years, through recessions and war, through stability and revolutions, they were always there, one gadget after another, from transistor radios to TRS-80s to Walkmen and Gameboys, then iPods and Flips, GoPros and Fitbits. We were sure gadgets would always be with us, because they had always been with us, and it was good.What happened to gadgets? It\u2019s a fascinating story about tech progress, international manufacturing and shifting consumer preferences, and it all ends in a sad punch line: Great gadget companies are now having a harder time than ever getting off the ground. The gadget age is over \u2014 and even if that\u2019s a kind of progress, because software now fills many of our needs, the great gadgetapocalypse is bound to make the tech world, and your life, a little less fun.Things were never easy for gadgets. The lives of gadgets have always been nasty, brutish and short. One year a gadget would be the Must Have of the Year, and the next year it would be old news. But that was the cycle, and it was fine, because there would always be another gadget.Then things got even worse. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the Thing That Does Everything emerged from Cupertino, Calif. That was almost 10 years ago now. You know what I\u2019m talking about: the iPhone. We knew the Thing was going to be big, but we didn\u2019t know it would be this big. When the Thing threatened to eat up all the gadgets, nobody thought it would really happen. We still had hope that some gadgets would stick around.Much of this isn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cHardware is hard\u201d is an actual phrase that people in Silicon Valley say to pass for wise. What they mean is, starting a company that makes physical stuff has always been more perilous than starting a company that just makes code.That\u2019s why the hardware market has recently been ruled by big companies, either as stand-alone businesses for the likes of Apple and Samsung, or as a kind of come-on for other services. Amazon makes devices like the Kindle and the Echo as an accelerant to its content businesses and its Prime subscription program. Google and Microsoft appear more serious about hardware, and they both might turn devices into nice side businesses. But neither sees hardware as a primary moneymaker; the devices are mainly ways to get us to use more of their software.For start-ups, even in these days of easy contract manufacturing in China, gadgets involve a lot of costs \u2014 you need money for parts and a factory, and shipping and distribution, and you need virtually everything to go perfectly, because if your first gadget is a bust or has some fatal bug, you won\u2019t have a lot of money to make a second one. And even if your gadget is a success, it won\u2019t last long. The gadget economy is hits driven \u2014 you\u2019re only as good as your next big thing.And once you get a hit, you\u2019ll get hit by cheap knockoffs. Just before I went on a trip to Hawaii last year, I thought it would be fun to get a GoPro camera to record some pool stunts. But when I searched Amazon.com, I noticed a ton of generic \u201caction cameras\u201d that carried many of the same specs as the GoPros, at a steep discount on price. I ended up buying an SJCAM for $75, about half the price of the cheapest GoPro I could find. And you know what? It worked pretty well.This is the mixed blessing of cheaper manufacturing. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s much easier to be a hardware start-up than it ever was before, because the Shenzhen ecosystem gives you all the components you need,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, referring to the manufacturing hub Shenzhen, in southern China. \u201cBut that same ecosystem is available to everybody else, too, so setting yourself apart is really tough.\u201dYou might point out that the SJCAM I purchased lacked some of the finer qualities of a GoPro. Its software wasn\u2019t great, and it didn\u2019t offer customer support. If I were an extreme sports enthusiast, I might have cared about those deficiencies. For years, after all, GoPro managed to do very well among its niche audience of people who ride bikes in the snow while drinking Mountain Dew, or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re Xtreme. Other manufacturers tapped other niches \u2014 there are gadgets for running, hiking, walking and several other sports.But Mr. Dawson noted that eventually these companies reach the limit of their natural niche. Every sports enthusiast already has a GoPro \u2014 and that\u2019s when trouble begins. Because I\u2019m more of an extreme Twitter enthusiast than extreme sports guy, and because for me every gadget is essentially just an accessory to my smartphone, the cheaper knockoffs are usually fine for my purposes. This is likely to be the case for you, too.There is something sad about this. The gadget marketplace is the great laboratory of new tech. Gadget start-ups feed the entire tech ecosystem with new ideas. It\u2019s thanks to Pebble that we first saw the latent demand for smartwatches, and thanks to GoPro we realized that people really wanted to take videos of themselves doing underwater handstands. Would we ever have had the iPod if a bunch of start-ups in the late 1990s hadn\u2019t braved legal trouble to create portable MP3 players?But new stuff? Stuff we haven\u2019t seen before? Gadgets? They\u2019re gone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bid for Access to Amazon Echo Audio in Murder Case Raises Privacy Concerns", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byIn a move that promises to raise new questions about electronic privacy, detectives investigating a murder in Arkansas are seeking access to audio that may have been recorded on an Amazon Echo electronic personal assistant.So far, the online retail giant has resisted demands by the police and prosecutors in Bentonville, Ark., for the information. Without addressing the specifics of the case, Amazon said in a statement that, as a matter of course, it \u201cobjects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands.\u201dDetective Cpl. Josh Woodhams of the Bentonville Police Department wrote in an affidavit that he found an Amazon Echo on the home\u2019s kitchen counter. The voice-activated device has seven microphones, and is equipped with sensors to hear users from any direction up to about 20 feet. Among other things, it can play music, make to-do lists, stream podcasts and provide real-time news and information.In February, Mr. Bates was charged with murder, and as part of the investigation, the police sought from Amazon \u201celectronic data in the form of audio recordings, transcribed words, text records and other data\u201d captured by the Echo.The request has raised concern among some right-to-privacy supporters.Once it detects the wake word, according to Amazon, the Echo starts streaming audio to the cloud, where it is secured until the customer permanently deletes it.The case raises \u201cserious privacy concerns with this kind of nonspecific warrant,\u201d Ms. Terwoerds said, adding, \u201cWe have to fight against the myth of Echo listening in on our every word and sending that data to Amazon \u2014 it\u2019s simply untrue.\u201dJon Simpson, the police chief in Bentonville, which, by car, is about three hours northwest of Little Rock, referred questions to Nathan Smith, the prosecuting attorney in Benton County. In an email, Mr. Smith said Amazon had yet to fully comply with two requests, although he said it had provided \u201csome very limited subscriber information.\u201dWhile many right-to-privacy supporters have expressed interest in the request, Mr. Smith said the case was \u201c really about seeking justice for the victim.\u201d He added that it was the responsibility of the police to seek the data to determine its relevance to the investigation.

{"Headline": "A Founder of Odwalla Tries to Recapture His Mojo", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cOdwalla took him to the top of the world and then to the bottom,\u201d said Berne Evans, his business partner today. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever gotten over it.\u201dToday it\u2019s possible for a company to develop a drink and cut a deal with an assembly line for hire to produce it, and negotiate another deal for someone to distribute it. Just a decade ago, it required far more capital and, eventually, a sprawling operation.Only a few years after its founding, in 2012, Califia is on track to ring up $100 million in sales and is adding products at a fast clip. The company is considered one of the hottest young brands in the beverage world, leading to whispers about whether one of the big competitors will soon swoop in with a buyout offer that Mr. Steltenpohl and his partners can\u2019t refuse.Not this time, he insists. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sell out once,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cThat was enough.\u201dThat\u2019s easier to say than to do. A little more than a month ago, Ben Weiss, the founder of the flavored water company Bai, also brushed back talk of a buyout. \u201cIt\u2019s called Bai, not Sell,\u201d he said in an interview at the time.His argument was not unique these days. He had already teamed up to a degree with one competitor. The company\u2019s drinks, which it called \u201cenhanced waters,\u201d got some distribution from Dr Pepper. And Bai was outselling a competitor in retail stores: Over the previous 12 weeks, Bai had outsold Vitaminwater, a Coke brand, for the first time, Mr. Weiss said.It was on track for $300 million in annual sales, outselling Pepsi and Coke on Amazon, internet sales that help many young beverage companies extend their reach to far corners of the country without giant distribution networks.There are more opportunities for young drinks companies than ever, as consumers who have abandoned sugary and diet sodas search for alternatives to plain water. Hint Inc., for instance, is on track to ring up $90 million in sales this year, having leveraged its early distribution in Google\u2019s cafeterias into shelf space at Whole Foods, Target and other stores.Last month, Cason Thorsby, a newly minted entrepreneur in Detroit, began selling in restaurants, bars and groceries there a line of sugar-free, naturally flavored, \u201csuperinfused\u201d sodas branded with his first name. And new juice businesses like OnJuice, Misfit Juicery and Roots Juices, many of which start out selling their products online, come to life every month, or so it seems.Duane Stanford, the editor of Beverage Digest, said a young beverage company today can buy its flavors from a flavor house, branding expertise from a branding expert and manufacturing from a producer on contract.\u201cYou have this situation where these companies can become viable, robust, cash-generating businesses without the help of a big company,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re even getting creative at building independent distribution networks.\u201dOdwalla came together out of a necessity to eat. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in environmental sciences, Mr. Steltenpohl joined with some friends to start a band called the Stance. He also got hooked on the taste of fresh-squeezed orange juice, which his father made for him.\u201cWe were a band of musicians who weren\u2019t really that accomplished \u2014 or popular,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said of himself and the band members, who became his partners in Odwalla. \u201cWe were broke and starving, and we figured if we started a juice business, we could live off the juice and maybe make a little extra.\u201dHe read a book, \u201c100 Businesses You Can Start For $100,\u201d and the partners invested in a juicer and started making juice. They didn\u2019t even try to break into groceries and convenience stores, instead stocking refrigerators in video stores and laundromats with Odwalla fresh juice each day. \u201cEveryone who was a musician back then was basically living out of a VW bus,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cWe quit living in ours and began selling juice out of the back.\u201dFor most of its early years, the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union financed the company. But as consumers cottoned on to its intensely flavored, wacky mixes of unpasteurized juice, it needed something more.A friend introduced Mr. Steltenpohl to Bill Hambrecht, a founder of Hambrecht & Quist, the investment bank that financed some of Silicon Valley\u2019s early start-ups. Hambrecht & Quist became Odwalla\u2019s first institutional investor, and Mr. Hambrecht began serving as a sort of consigliere. \u201cHe helped us understand that anarchy isn\u2019t the best business model,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.In 1993, Hambrecht & Quist helped take Odwalla public, which allowed it to expand nationally and into Canada. By 1996, it had roughly $60 million in sales, a new plant and refrigerated delivery trucks to replace the VW vans.Then the music stopped.\u201cI got a call from the King County department of health,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl whispered, tearing up at the memory. \u201cFive or six people in Seattle had come down with what looked like E. coli poisoning, and the common element was apple juice, our apple juice.\u201dIn the end, at least 66 people got sick after drinking Odwalla juice, and a child died. The brand\u2019s claims about the healthiness came back to haunt it as reporters dug into its failure to heed warnings about food-safety lapses.Odwalla ended up in the hands of private equity groups, and when it became apparent that the goal was to sell the company to Coca-Cola, Mr. Steltenpohl left.\u201cFor Coke, the thinking was fresh juice is becoming important, we need a fresh juice, Odwalla will fill that need,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never saw the enormous potential of the Odwalla brand and instead saw it as just another product in the juice portfolio.\u201d(Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Coke, said that Odwalla is an important part of what the company calls its \u201cnatural healthy beverages portfolio and that Coke would continue to invest in marketing and new products to grow the brand.\u201d)Mr. Steltenpohl then teamed up with Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, and started a payment system that rewarded loyalty to local businesses.Then he collaborated with an African entrepreneur to develop Adina, a hibiscus tea business now owned by a Mexican beverage company. \u201cIt was a pretty ambitious project to source hibiscus from a women\u2019s co-op in Africa and make it into teas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of prejudice, and it was difficult to get any margin on the product \u2014 it was so idealistic.\u201dMr. Steltenpohl was charged with building and operating the plant that would squeeze the misfit fruit into juice. But just as construction began on the plant in Bakersfield, Calif., Mr. Evans\u2019s partner in Cuties, the agricultural group now known as the Wonderful Company, backed out. \u201cWithout its clementines to run the plant, we couldn\u2019t run it efficiently,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIn other words, we overbuilt the plant.\u201dSo Mr. Steltenpohl returned to an idea he had toyed with many years before.Shortly after the E. coli contamination, Odwalla had tried selling a product called Future Shake that was made from almonds, oats and soy. But its texture was too thick, and it never took off.\u201cAt that point, I really wasn\u2019t thinking of returning to the company at all,\u201d he said.But after the surgery, the hospital gave him a protein beverage to aid in his recovery, and the ingredients in it were so bad that he decided he had to make Califia work.The first batch of almond milk rolled off the production line in 2012 and quickly took off.The product had the advantage of its own production facility and what Mr. Steltenpohl had learned about distribution while at Odwalla. It also had the advantage of a far different retail landscape. When the Odwalla crisis hit, Amazon was in its infancy, and Whole Foods, which often serves as a sort of ambassador for new food and beverage brands, had just a handful of stores.Today, Amazon is putting up its own grocery stores, and Whole Foods has nearly 500 stores. At the same time, convenience stores have become much bigger points of distribution for a wide variety of drinks.And consumers are abandoning traditional soft drinks, both sugared and diet, in droves and searching for new flavors delivered in new ways.In the last year, Mr. Steltenpohl has pushed almond milk drinks flavored with things like ginger, mocha and matcha. More recently, Califia is putting the almond milk into cold-brewed and nitrogen-infused coffees, a technique borrowed from the beer business. The nitrogen imparts a sweetness to coffee, helping to reduce the amount of sugar needed. According to data from Euromonitor, bottled coffee is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in America, and Califia\u2019s cold-brewed version outsells the packaged Starbucks version.Mr. Steltenpohl is also trying to avoid past mistakes. The plant is equipped with cutting-edge food-safety monitors that share alerts about problems as they happen with the entire senior management team. Josh Butt, who previously oversaw food safety systems at Danone, the big French dairy company, presides over the plant\u2019s operations.In the year ended Sept. 4, Califia\u2019s sales more than doubled, hitting $85 million, according to data from IRI, which does not include the bottled coffee.In other words, the company is big enough to be attractive to a larger player.\u201cAs for big-brand interest, it would be accurate to say there has already been substantial interest \u2014 but as I\u2019ve said, I really don\u2019t want to go that route of selling while the company is so relatively young,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said. \u201cFinding ways to continue to grow the company into a major brand with a high degree of independence is a major lifelong objective.\u201dPrivate equity groups have also come calling. One year ago, the Stripes Group, a Manhattan-based private equity group that has a stake in the food delivery service Blue Apron, among other businesses, put up $50 million for a little less than 20 percent of Califia\u2019s stock, giving the company a value of more than $250 million.Mr. Steltenpohl and his executive team have options giving them the right to as much as a quarter of the company, and Mr. Evans owns the rest \u2014 a majority of the business \u2014 but \u201cit\u2019s really Greg\u2019s company,\u201d he said, adding that he was in no hurry to exit his investment. (Mr. Evans declined to comment on whether he earned money from the Stripes Group transaction.)That said, the tried-and-true endgame of selling out to a big competitor could prove too inviting, particularly in the wake of Danone\u2019s purchase of WhiteWave this year.The advantages that deal brought to WhiteWave have caused some sleepless nights for Mr. Steltenpohl, even though sales of his competitor\u2019s almond milk have been flat. Danone has the wherewithal to pay slotting fees to supermarkets to bump products into prime positions on the refrigerated shelves, regardless of how well they are selling.\u201cThat makes it harder for us younger dogs,\u201d Mr. Steltenpohl said.But he said chains like Target and Kroger are relying more on what he called \u201cfact based\u201d assessment to determine where they put products on their shelves. And he hints that Califia will introduce a \u201ccultured product\u201d some time next year \u2014 read: something probiotic. Which may just give Danone reason to watch its back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Meitu, an Aspirational Beauty App, Goes Public", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Your phone can make your face whiter. A touch can taper your jaw. It can slim your cheeks. Widen your eyes. Of course, it can make you thinner.Meitu and its related apps are hugely popular in China. The apps have 446 million users, and Meitu says more than half of the photos circulated on social media there in June were filtered using its editing app.\u201cMeitu makes everybody look more beautiful in an easy way,\u201d says Du Sha, 26, a graduate student who uses it mainly to erase acne and to smooth and brighten her skin. \u201cIt\u2019s a good technology for people to be more social or improve their self-confidence.\u201dThe question is whether the world wants Meitu\u2019s idea of beauty.Apps like Instagram and Snapchat have long allowed people to apply flattering filters and wash out their pores. Meitu goes several steps beyond. Cheeks can be stretched and pinched. Chins can be shaved off. Eyes can be contoured.In addition, its tools are tailored toward a standard of beauty \u2014 female beauty, mostly \u2014 that is particular to China and countries like South Korea and Japan: pale skin, elfin features, skinny limbs, eyes wide and guileless as a baby seal\u2019s.\u201cI want to look cuter sometimes,\u201d said Zha Nan, 23, an information technology researcher who has used the app for years. \u201cUsing Meitu to fix these things, I feel more comfortable looking at my own face.\u201dMeitu says local teams in different markets are tailoring the software to other standards. But, more fundamentally, Meitu approaches the subject of looks in a manner that reflects common thinking in modern China \u2014 like money, education and a good job, beauty is something one can aspire to.It\u2019s a case of \u201c\u2018I do it because I would like to have a beautiful photo in my C.V.,\u2019\u201d said Wen Hua, a gender consultant for the United Nations Population Fund who wrote a book about cosmetic surgery in China called \u201cBuying Beauty.\u201d Beauty, she says, is seen as a step toward success in work and in society.\u201cEventually it may not work in that way,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s people\u2019s perception of it.\u201dChina \u2014 which went from grinding poverty to economic powerhouse in the span of a generation \u2014 is an aspirational market. Companies like Apple, Starbucks and Audi have made fat profits selling high-priced gadgets, coffee and rides to Chinese consumers who want to show they have made it.Still, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small elite, and the average Chinese consumer has only a fraction of the money to spend as the average American does. Hundreds of millions of people still live in rural areas with few prospects for jobs. Competition to get into universities is fierce, and competition for good jobs after college can be fiercer.For women, the field can be even tougher. China\u2019s anti-discrimination laws are rarely enforced. Help-wanted ads often specify whether the employer is looking for a man or a woman, and those looking for females often set height or appearance requirements.The growth of China\u2019s service sector puts further pressure on appearance. China\u2019s manufacturing jobs in the past had such strong job security that they were sometimes called the \u201ciron rice bowl.\u201d But the growth of the service sector has led to more jobs that focus on appearance, leading some women to aim for what Ms. Wen refers to as the \u201crice bowl of youth.\u201dAmong those women, certain looks send certain messages. A slim figure and winsome look implies youth. Pale skin denotes a life spent indoors rather than outside working like a farmer.That\u2019s far from the days of the Cultural Revolution, when makeup was seen as a trapping of bourgeois vanity. Sales of beauty and personal care products in China grew by more than half between 2010 and 2015, according to Euromonitor, a market data provider, and now total more than $50 billion annually.Cosmetic surgery has boomed \u2014 but in China, unlike other places, it is a market for the young. In China, people under 35 are the main customers for cosmetic surgery, while 80 percent of people getting plastic surgery in the United States are over 35, according to a report on the industry by HSBC. It cited, as one motivator, the prevalence of smartphone apps that expose people to beauty marketing and encourage them to scrutinize their photos.Liu Yu says she feels the pressure to look good. She even uses Meitu for photos that go on formal identification cards and her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she said, though her edits are far more modest than what she posts for online consumption.\u201cMany women always feel like they have flaws,\u201d said Ms. Liu, 23, a graduate film student who uses Meitu to narrow her face, shrink her nose and remove dark circles from under her eyes. \u201cThey all wish that through some kind of method they can make themselves more beautiful. Meitu is the cheapest and most convenient way to do this.\u201dMeitu didn\u2019t create this phenomenon, of course, and it rejects the idea that its business model relies on people\u2019s insecurities or cultural pressures. Gary Ngan, its chief financial officer, says the company offers a variety of apps in part because users have a personal idea of what is beautiful.\u201cWe have to broaden the term beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a set way of thinking about Asian beauty. It\u2019s about making you happy.\u201dHe said the company was, instead, helping its users to become more confident and helping them to \u201cbecome more beautiful in real life.\u201d\u201cFor example, when you slim your face and then eventually you say, \u2018Oh, I look nice,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cthen you go on a diet, go to the gym and then you become the one\u201d in the picture.With features such as skin whitening, Meitu says it wants to be flexible and offer options only in markets where they make sense.\u201cOne of the fundamental beliefs of the company is that the use has to be extremely simple,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist who owns a stake in Meitu. Skin tone, for example, is \u201cfixed to each country,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it preferable to have a tan? Some of that is automatic, some within the user\u2019s control.\u201dMeitu will rely on an algorithm to adapt as it moves into other markets. The company collects data on which functions are used the most. Then it uses that data to create or tweak tools to give users what they want, often in consultation with beauty experts, celebrities and local advisers. Some of Meitu\u2019s other apps, like one called MakeupPlus, start with the person\u2019s skin color and offer tools based on that.Beauty, said Mr. Ngan, is \u201csomewhat synonymous with happiness, in a way, because you generally feel more happy when you\u2019re more beautiful.\u201dAmie Tsang reported from Hong Kong, and Emily Feng from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s global business empire will create an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest for a United States president, experts say.Mr. Miller did not respond to requests seeking additional details on Mr. Trump\u2019s stock sales, and it is not known why Mr. Trump liquidated his holdings this year. In addition to his June sell-off, earlier this year Mr. Trump disclosed that he had sold a handful of stocks, leading to speculation he needed cash to keep his presidential bid afloat. Mr. Trump relied on his own money, as well as that from donors, to pay for his campaign.On Aug. 2, during an interview with Stuart Varney on the Fox Business Network, Mr. Trump was asked if he was \u201can investor in the stock market now.\u201d He replied: \u201cI did, and I got out. I did invest and I got out, and it was actually very good timing, but I\u2019ve never been a big investor in the stock market.\u201dWhatever Mr. Trump\u2019s motives, the sale does little to mitigate the larger conflict-of-interest concerns that have followed him since the election.

{"Headline": "Rail Crossing Warnings Are Sought for Mapping Apps", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Following directions from Google Maps on a smartphone last year, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez turned a Ford truck, hauling a trailer, where he thought the app was telling him to go. But he ended up stuck on the railroad tracks at a poorly marked California crossing.Soon after Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez abandoned the truck, a commuter train barreled into it, killing the engineer and injuring 32 others.On Monday, after investigating the crash for almost two years, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a safety recommendation asking technology and delivery companies to add the exact locations of more than 200,000 grade crossings into digital maps and to provide alerts when drivers encounter them.The crash involving Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez\u2019s truck \u2014 on Feb. 24, 2015, in Oxnard, Calif. \u2014 was one of the more than 200 fatalities that took place at a grade crossing, where road and railway lines are at the same level, in the United States last year. What made this crash stand out was the possible role of digital mapping technology in taking a driver down a wrong path. This was the first time the safety board has targeted navigation apps as a factor in a major accident.\u201cThe safer car in the future isn\u2019t going to have a better bumper; it\u2019s going to have better navigation,\u201d said Eric Gundersen, chief executive of Mapbox, a digital map provider.The Federal Railroad Administration has lobbied technology companies for 18 months to add alerts for grade crossings. The rail agency said it had contacted 11 technology companies, including Apple and Microsoft, to integrate its location data of grade crossings.In this year\u2019s lineup of GPS devices, Garmin included safety warnings for potential hazards like sharp turns and railroad crossings, the company said, although it does not use the federal rail location data.Several months after the Oxnard crash, the railroad agency said Google had agreed to add audio and visual warnings to Google Maps, the world\u2019s most popular mapping app, based on grade-crossing location data. But Google has not yet included that feature, even though it has updated the app more than two dozen times for the iPhone since then.The National Transportation Safety Board said Apple and three other companies had also agreed to add crossing data, but the board was uncertain when the companies would do so.A spokeswoman from Google said the company was aware of the safety board\u2019s recommendation and was looking at ways to add safety features. Apple said it was working to add the rail data to its maps but would not elaborate on implementation specifics. Microsoft and MapQuest said they were also reviewing the data used in their maps.In a speech on Sept. 15, Sarah E. Feinberg, administrator of the railroad agency, said many of the recent deaths at rail crossings were not from drivers trying to \u201cbeat the train\u201d but were \u201csituations where the driver lost situational awareness, or there weren\u2019t sufficient protections in place to protect the vehicle or provide adequate warning to the driver.\u201dShe chided technology companies for procrastinating on integrating data into mapping applications that \u201cwill save many lives.\u201dOn Monday, Ms. Feinberg praised the safety board\u2019s recommendation, saying she hoped it \u201cwill raise this to the top of technology companies\u2019 priority lists.\u201dThe N.T.S.B.\u2019s recommendations are not binding, but the board can use them to pressure technology companies to take action. It can also try to persuade Congress to offer funds to provide incentives to the companies, said James E. Hall, a former chairman of the safety board.The board has issued map-related safety recommendations in the past, urging utility companies to update their maps with accurate locations of abandoned gas lines.Digital maps started replacing paper maps about a decade ago, when stand-alone GPS devices from companies like Garmin and TomTom became more affordable and car companies started offering built-in navigation systems. But the breakthrough came when Google and Apple added turn-by-turn directions into mapping apps on smartphones, putting the technology into millions of devices already in people\u2019s pockets.Globally, an estimated one billion people use a mapping app or service every week, according to the technology research firm Berg Insight.In the Oxnard crash, the driver was using Google Maps in Spanish on a smartphone borrowed from his wife. Investigators believe the map was one of a number of factors, including driver fatigue.Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez was on a 350-mile drive from his home in Yuma, Ariz. What was supposed to be a six-hour trip had stretched to 21 hours because his truck broke down along the way and he was involved in a minor crash. He came upon the rail crossing before sunrise, having not slept substantively in more than 24 hours, the safety board\u2019s report said.\u201cThe N.T.S.B. concludes that had the driver\u2019s navigation application included information on the upcoming grade crossing, he would have been less likely to misinterpret the visual cues and mistakenly turn onto the railroad tracks,\u201d the safety board wrote in its report.At the time, the crossing had no grade separation, and there were no cones or markers warning drivers from turning onto the rails. Since 2008, there have been five accidents at that crossing, including one in 2010 when a confused driver turned onto the tracks and was struck by a train. The driver was injured, but there were no fatalities.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand how in the dark, a sleep-deprived driver unfamiliar with the area can turn at the wrong place if a navigation app says, \u2018Turn here,\u2019\u201d said James McGillis, who lives near Oxnard, in Simi Valley, and has written extensively on his website about the crash.The police found Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez a mile from his truck. He had abandoned it on the tracks with the headlights and hazard lights on and the driver\u2019s door open. Ron Bamieh, Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez\u2019s lawyer, said his client was trying to get help. Mr. Sanchez-Ramirez was charged in February of this year with vehicular manslaughter and is awaiting arraignment.At some grade crossings, there are no gates or blinking lights to warn drivers of an oncoming train \u2014 just a crossing sign or a crossbuck, a white \u201cX\u201d marked with the words \u201crailroad crossing.\u201d Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, said grade crossings could be especially dangerous because drivers often do not take the proper precautions, especially with all the other distractions in the car.\u201cSometimes we want to distract while they are distracted,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said, praising the safety board\u2019s move. \u201cThat level of technology can be a game changer.\u201dThe need for a recommendation speaks to the dependence some drivers feel toward navigation apps, choosing to follow directions from the app even in the face of contradictory information.In February, after a rockslide closed Interstate 70 in Colorado, directions from Google Maps sent drivers over a mountain pass near Aspen as an alternative. But that road was closed for the winter.A spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Amy Ford, said many drivers ignored road signs informing them that the road was closed and followed the apps instead. The most determined drivers became stranded and needed assistance from law enforcement.\u201cIt\u2019s become integral for many drivers,\u201d said Jake Nelson, AAA\u2019s director of traffic safety advocacy and research. \u201cThe risk is when we become over-reliant on these technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Price and wage competition lowers profits and stock values.Will Mr. Trump fight for the interests of the working-class voters who brought him to power? Our approach would raise living standards while making American companies more competitive.If the new administration\u2019s antitrust enforcers ignore this chance to follow through on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises, voters should hold him to account.Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

{"Headline": "Designing a Safer Battery for Smartphones (That Won\u2019t Catch Fire)", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mike Zimmerman likes to shock his guests by using a hammer to drive a nail through a solid polymer lithium metal battery.Nothing happens \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.With that in mind, Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s demonstration commands attention.His Woburn, Mass., start-up, Ionic Materials, is at the cutting edge of an effort to design safer batteries. The company is working on \u201csolid\u201d lithium polymer batteries that greatly reduce their combustible nature.A solid lithium polymer metal battery \u2014 when it arrives commercially \u2014 will also allow electronics designers to be more creative, because they will be able to use a plasticlike material (the polymer) that allows smaller and more flexible packaging and requires fewer complex safety mechanisms.\u201cMy dream is to create the holy grail of solid batteries,\u201d Mr. Zimmerman said.After four years of development, he believes he is nearly there and hopes to begin manufacturing within the next two years. Ionic Materials is one of a new wave of academic and commercial research efforts in the United States, Europe and Asia to find safer battery technologies as consumers demand more performance from phones and cars.In the last year, Seeo and Sakti, rival United States solid polymer battery makers, have been acquired by the German industrial firm Bosch and the British vacuum maker Dyson.The interest in solid batteries was highlighted in September when the United States Department of Energy\u2019s agency for supporting research in next-generation energy technology, announced 16 awards aimed at accelerating development of solid battery technologies, including a $3 million contract to Ionic Materials.There is growing evidence that after decades of excruciatingly slow development, batteries are on the verge of yielding to a new generation of material science.Historically, batteries have been a glaring exception to the exponential progress of made-by-computer processing and storage. In the last 150 years, in fact, only a handful of rechargeable battery chemistries have reached mass adoption.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d said Ilan Gur, director of Cyclotron Road, a project to support energy-related innovators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cThe improvements in batteries happen very slowly, and the improvement of battery chemistry is very hard.\u201dHe points to disappointments with batteries going back more than a century.Thomas Edison voiced his frustration at the technology in an interview in 1883: \u201cThe storage battery is one of those peculiar things which appeal to the imagination, and no more perfect thing could be desired by stock swindlers than that very selfsame thing.\u201dModern consumer electronics designers are not a great deal more optimistic.\u201cThe only real breakthrough battery technology I\u2019ve seen during my career was lithium-ion batteries, 18-plus years ago,\u201d said Tony Fadell, an electrical engineer who led the design of the iPod and original iPhone at Apple before founding Nest, the maker of home thermostats. \u201cSometimes it feels like a Captain Ahab-like quest.\u201dLithium-ion batteries, introduced commercially in 1991 by Sony, offered a significant advantage over existing nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries in terms of compactness and rechargability.But they also have the potential for failures that on two occasions have forced the consumer electronics industry into broad recalls. Sony had a series of problems with battery fires beginning in 2000, culminating in the recall of 4.2 million laptop batteries in 2006 \u2014 at the time the largest consumer electronics recall to date.This fall, the recall of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7, a high-end smartphone, brought flammable batteries back into the news. Customers around the world reported that the phones were catching fire. Why it was happening is still unclear. A Samsung spokeswoman said that the company had not completed its evaluation of what led to the battery failures.Many battery specialists say they believe that the failure lies in the South Korean electronics companies\u2019 desire to create a thinner battery package, leading to the design of an ultrathin separator, a safety feature intended to prevent battery electrodes from contacting each other directly. That could create a short circuit, leading to fire or explosion.This use of liquid electrolytes is an inherent, potential flaw in lithium-ion batteries. They are based on liquid electrolytes, a material used to ensure the movement of ions, or charged particles, between the electrodes as the batteries are charged and discharged.For more than a decade, a hunt has been underway for an alternative solid material that would be less volatile. There has been optimism about new solid polymers that might replace liquid electrolytes, but they have not moved to commercialization \u2014 with the exception of a lithium polymer battery now being used by Bollor\u00e9, the French electric carmaker.But that technology is aimed at electric car batteries and it does not operate at room temperature \u2014 it requires preheating to roughly 192 degrees \u2014 something that has been true for virtually all of the lithium metal polymer batteries to date.Room temperature operation is just one of the potential advantages claimed by Ionic Materials. Its new polymer also has the ability to shuttle ions between a battery cathode and electrode as efficiently as is currently achieved by liquid electrolytes, or even more efficiently.Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s background is in the world of semiconductors; he worked at Bell Labs and then a company called Quantum Leap Packaging. Several university researchers who have worked with the company believe that has lead him to a technology that will be more manufacturable than competing polymer and ceramic battery technologies now being explored.\u201cWhat is so intriguing about Mike and his folks is they are using known production techniques borrowed from the semiconductor packaging industry,\u201d said Jay Whitacre, a Carnegie Mellon University physicist who was involved with Ionic Materials when it first started and who now is chief scientist at Aquion Energy, a maker of home storage and industrial batteries based in Mt. Pleasant, Pa.The new progress has led a number of technologists in the field to believe that batteries may finally be getting out of their rut.\u201cWe\u2019re in a golden age of new chemistry development which probably hasn\u2019t been seen in thirty or 40 years, since the last energy crisis,\u201d said Paul Albertus, a program manager at the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty exciting time to be developing energy storage technology.\u201dAn article on Monday about efforts to build safer batteries misidentified the work of Cyclotron Road. It is a project that supports energy innovators; it does not provide funding for start-ups.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Apple Hurls the \u2018Patent Troll\u2019 Insult at Nokia", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byBitsAmong the many terrible things you can call someone in the tech industry, one of the most damning is \u201cpatent troll.\u201dA patent troll is a term for a company whose business is solely based on licensing the use of patents to other companies. Sometimes these licensing deals are negotiated amicably, and sometimes they\u2019re settled in a protracted legal battle.Trolls have been around for some time, and a few years ago, many in Silicon Valley argued that trolls were a crippling drag on the industry, particularly on start-ups that don\u2019t have the financial resources to fight. But there was thought by people in the tech industry that the most egregious examples of their patent exploitation had eased in recent years, which brings us back to Apple and Nokia.There is little dispute that most of the Nokia patents are legitimate. Before the company came undone mostly because of competition from outfits like Apple, Nokia was a pioneer in mobile phones.The issue, as is usually the case, is money. For the last five years, Apple has licensed a portfolio of Nokia products. But the two companies have not been able to negotiate a new deal.Adding another wrinkle is Nokia\u2019s intellectual property partners. Nokia has divided its portfolio and transferred parts of it to Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management: Both companies find ways to make money from the patents, and then share the proceeds with Nokia.Apple says Acacia and Conversant have filed 52 cases against it around the world, many of which assert violations of Nokia patents. Apple also says that\u2019s an attempt to unfairly increase costs; it has filed an antitrust suit to stop Nokia. But it seems unlikely the fight will be over anytime soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How China Built \u2018iPhone City\u2019 With Billions in Perks for Apple\u2019s Partner", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "China RulesA hidden bounty of benefits for Foxconn\u2019s plant in Zhengzhou, the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, is central to the production of Apple\u2019s most profitable product.Supported byZHENGZHOU, China \u2014 A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China.Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes \u2014 counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations.The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world\u2019s most valuable company and one of China\u2019s largest retailers.The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple\u2019s best-selling and most profitable product.It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as \u201ciPhone City.\u201dThe local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants.It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets.All of it in support of iPhone production.\u201cWe needed something that could really develop this part of the country,\u201d said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in China: \u2018If you build the nest, the birds will come.\u2019 And now, they\u2019re coming.\u201dAmerican officials have long decried China\u2019s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China\u2019s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country.Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world.But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate \u2014 and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves.China\u2019s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world\u2019s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn.While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China\u2019s importance to American technology companies \u2014 and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple\u2019s consumer sales.A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren\u2019t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren\u2019t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn\u2019s negotiations.The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their \u201csupport\u201d for iPhone production, calling the benefits a \u201cpreferential policy.\u201d The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports.As China\u2019s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company\u2019s size and scale \u2014 and the sway that they afford in China \u2014 is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple\u2019s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn\u2019s largest customer.The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn\u2019s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world\u2019s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here.In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government\u2019s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner.Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was \u201cno different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.\u201dA growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China.China, no longer content with just being the world\u2019s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny.The two countries are playing a high-stakes game.As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs.As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store.Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone.The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation.The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn\u2019s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year.The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.Apple was late to China.In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company\u2019s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated.Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them \u2014 in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity.\u201cThis is a machine that is made in America,\u201d Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer.Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how.Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths \u2014 design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost.\u201cThey have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple\u2019s growth,\u201d said Joe O\u2019Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia.When Apple\u2019s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn\u2019s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.Foxconn\u2019s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.\u201cThe reason Foxconn\u2019s so big is Terry Gou,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. \u201cHe said he\u2019d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.\u201dAfter the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China \u2014 unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations.\u201cThese have become like Olympic competitions,\u201d said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China\u2019s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters.City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers.The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory.\u201cWe know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,\u201d said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park.\u201cI was impressed,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. \u201cThey were very focused.\u201dWhen Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers.But Apple initially had to take the \u201cHong Kong U-turn\u201d to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers.Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government\u2019s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands.Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports \u2014 hence, the U-turn employed by many companies.In 2005, Apple\u2019s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country\u2019s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China.\u201cThis was really a legacy of China\u2019s old export-oriented economy,\u201d said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. \u201cBack then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.\u201dApple and other multinationals wanted a better system.By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country.In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city\u2019s airport, to expedite Apple\u2019s global shipments.Although it wasn\u2019t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturing facility.A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world.As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple\u2019s global tax strategy.In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically.The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company\u2019s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China.\u201cU.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cIn doing so, they create stateless income \u2014 income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.\u201dAccording to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the \u201choly grail of tax avoidance.\u201d The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period.Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union.In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city\u2019s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends.In August 2014, the city\u2019s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss \u201cdeepening collaboration\u201d with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the \u201cbiggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.\u201dThere were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation\u2019s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city\u2019s tax revenue was rapidly rising.Officials had a name for it all: \u201cZhengzhou Speed.\u201dA crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab.They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones \u2014 up to 350 a minute.Apple\u2019s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government.As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers.\u201cEvery city\u2019s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,\u201d said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou.The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. \u201cIf the demand is high, then they will pay more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.\u201dCities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don\u2019t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China.As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology.To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China\u2019s State Council, the country\u2019s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters.The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue.\u201cThe government wants to know what you can give to China,\u201d said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. \u201cAnd they have the market and the muscle. They\u2019re not playing around anymore.\u201dChinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price.Apple has agreed to the government\u2019s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo \u201csecurity audits\u201d on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product.Mr. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple\u2019s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country\u2019s top leaders, including Mr. Xi.In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a \u201cpillar of its environmental strategy.\u201d He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple\u2019s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing.At the Hall of Purple Light in the government\u2019s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company\u2019s first research and development center in the country and to support the government\u2019s big focus on high-end manufacturing.Opposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou. Also present was the party leader of the province where Zhengzhou is located, Xie Fuzhan.Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting from Zhengzhou, China.

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Value to Riders Is Clear. To Investors, It May Prove More Elusive.", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThat makes Uber, valued at some $70 billion in private markets, sound a bit like Amazon. The $370 billion online retailer, which trades not far short of 100 times its skinny forecast earnings, achieves that outsize multiple partly on the belief that there\u2019s a sort of dial that the founder and boss, Jeff Bezos, can turn to stop giving consumers such good deals and slow down investment, making a huge profit suddenly appear.Perhaps the same applies to Uber, which is still losing $100 million per quarter even in its home market, The Information says, partly thanks to intense competition with its rival Lyft \u2014 not to mention aggressive market-share grabs from traditional taxis in big markets like New York City. To begin to justify its paper valuation, even at an Amazon- and Facebook-like enterprise value-to-Ebitda ratio of around 40, the company led by Travis Kalanick needs to turn its current loss into approaching $2 billion of positive Ebitda \u2014 a swing near $5 billion.With plenty of cash in the bank, Uber has time, and it is still expanding. But to help assess whether there is enough juice in its chosen markets, there is a concept in economics called the consumer surplus. It is a measure of the gap between what people are willing to pay for goods or services and what they actually pay.A group of economists under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research, among them the \u201cFreakonomics\u201d co-author Steven Levitt, analyzed a trove of big data from Uber. Because of the way the company deploys what it calls surge pricing \u2014 higher fares at times of high demand \u2014 they were able to investigate passengers\u2019 sensitivity to prices.This allowed the economists to estimate the consumer surplus enjoyed by users of Uber\u2019s most-used UberX service across its four biggest American markets \u2014 Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. They concluded that the surplus was $2.9 billion in 2015. Those cities made up 43 percent of the company\u2019s domestic gross bookings, so nationally the figure could be nearly $7 billion. The surplus is equivalent to 1.6 times what users actually paid, excluding surge pricing.Such a result implies there might be room for Uber to raise prices once it has saturated any given market, without taking away all the economic benefit customers currently enjoy. But it is not so simple given competition from both the likes of Lyft and taxi fleets.Take New York City. Add another assumption to the mix and divide the researchers\u2019 figure up according to city population, and the consumer surplus from UberX in the metropolis was about $1.5 billion last year.As for the Big Apple\u2019s iconic yellow taxis, another economist, Nicholas Buchholz at the University of Texas at Austin, used data that is now a few years old to conclude that the New York taxi industry generated a consumer surplus of some $260 million a year, with taxi industry profit amounting to an annual $1.6 billion.Looked at another way, there are 13,587 licensing medallions riveted to the hoods of yellow New York taxis. Near the peak, coinciding roughly with Mr. Buchholz\u2019s data, these were worth around $1.2 million each, according to statistics from New York\u2019s Taxi & Limousine Commission. Assume a capitalization multiple of 10 times, and that kind of price tag represents a proxy for profit over and above daily taxi running costs worth \u2014 reassuringly \u2014 around $1.6 billion a year.With Uber use exploding since then, it is not surprising that the near-monopoly riches available to taxi owners and operators have plunged. The value of a medallion has crashed to $500,000 or less. The same assumptions suggest the taxi industry now collects maybe $700 million a year over and above daily costs.The lost benefit has not all suddenly gone to taxi passengers. More likely, with the typical New York cab snagging roughly 10 percent fewer rides in 2015 than a year earlier, it has gone to Uber or, more accurately, to Uber\u2019s customers. The Silicon Valley interloper has also enlarged the market, adding far more rides than taxis have lost.Uber may choose to undercut taxis slightly, but it is about more than price. As Mr. Buchholz points out in his paper, traditional taxis forgo huge economic benefit by not being able to link customers waiting on street corners with empty vehicles \u2014 both geographically and in terms of matching overall demand and supply at any given time. Uber\u2019s app, its algorithms and the added twist of price flexibility help it capture this value.For now, Uber\u2019s Mr. Kalanick seems content for the gains to flow mainly to customers. Whether he has an Amazon-like knob to turn, though, is an open question. Taxis in New York and elsewhere are figuring out their own apps and algorithms to address the matching issue. And if Uber does put prices up, it will open the door for competitors. Above all, consumers like their surplus, and they became accustomed to it. Unless the company ends up with its own quasi-monopoly, grabbing a big chunk of that back for investors may prove a very bumpy road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Bets on Artificial Intelligence With Acquisition and New Lab", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byEnter Gary Marcus and Zoubin Ghahramani. The two men are being appointed as co-directors of Uber\u2019s new in-house research arm on artificial intelligence, which the ride-hailing company unveiled on Monday. The research arm\u2019s aim is to apply A.I. in areas like self-driving vehicles, along with solving other technological challenges through machine learning.All 15 people from the start-up will be absorbed by Uber. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The acquisition and new research arm, which will be called Uber\u2019s A.I. Labs, exemplifies how seriously Silicon Valley tech companies are betting on artificial intelligence. Google, Facebook and others have also pushed into artificial intelligence, which underlies voice recognition software, digital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, and technologies like self-driving cars. Many companies are racing to bring on new A.I. talent to compete against one another.\u201cEvery major company realizes how essential A.I. is to what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of data people are operating on, even the smallest gains in efficiency can turn out enormous changes at these companies, especially in terms of profit.\u201dMany of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, have tried to commercialize artificial intelligence through the application of algorithms modeled largely on how the human brain functions. This method, called deep learning, leans heavily on the vast data sets that private technology companies own and that are used to train computers to do simple tasks, such as match patterns or recognize faces in photographs.Part of what drew Uber to Dr. Marcus\u2019s team is that his start-up is tackling artificial intelligence in a different way. Rather than taking just one approach like deep learning, Geometric Intelligence combines data scientists who use varying techniques to study artificial intelligence, including the Bayesian and \u201cevolutionary\u201d methods.Dr. Marcus, who helped found Geometric Intelligence in late 2014, said the gist of his philosophy goes something like this: Instead of training machines by feeding them enormous amounts of data, what if computers were capable of learning more like humans by extrapolating a system of rules from just a few or even a single example?Besides autonomous vehicles, Uber said it expected its A.I. Labs to apply its method to other tasks, including combating fraud, extracting information from street signs and learning to improve its mapping research and capabilities.\u201cWhen step function changes in this field occur, we\u2019re going to see very significant differences in how businesses run themselves,\u201d Jeff Holden, Uber\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. He said the A.I. Labs and Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, which is home to the company\u2019s self-driving car research, will work in tandem with each other.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long time before a self-driving car will be able to make all the kinds of trips that Uber does every single day,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cBut the answers to this are all going to come in the form of artificial intelligence.\u201dMr. Holden said recruiting A.I. research talent is highly competitive, especially as Google, Apple and Tesla are also developing self-driving cars or related projects.\u201cFrom a defensive perspective, if someone else develops them first, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a new co-director of Uber\u2019s in-house research arm on artificial intelligence. He is Zoubin Ghahramani, not Ghahraman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple and Nokia Battle Over Cellphone Patents", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone is a technological marvel. You can watch streaming video on it, download apps, take photos with its camera and give voice commands to Siri, its digital assistant. You can even make old-fashioned voice calls on it.Nokia, the Finnish company that was the world\u2019s largest cellphone maker until its business was decimated by Apple and makers of Android-based phones, claims none of those features would exist without its inventions, which were made over many years and after billions of dollars were invested in research.For the past five years, Apple has paid Nokia a modest royalty for the use of its patents. But with that pact about to expire on Dec. 31, Nokia wants Apple to keep paying for that portfolio, and is demanding that Apple license additional patents. Apple is refusing to pay Nokia\u2019s price and has accused it of extortion.\u201cApple is saying, we want to pay one low price and not have to deal with any of your patents again,\u201d Clem Roberts, an intellectual property lawyer at Durie Tangri in San Francisco, said. \u201cNokia is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want that low price because my patents are worth more than that.\u2019\u201dThe fight underscores just how much today\u2019s smartphones rely on an earlier generation of technology. It also shows how cellphone pioneers like Nokia, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola, whose patents are now owned by Google, are still trying to profit from the industry in which they are now bit players, at best.\u201cObviously, the iPhone was not created on a green field but was built on what others created before Apple,\u201d said Florian Mueller, a German iPhone app developer and former consultant to technology companies who has followed the cellphone patent wars. \u201cOn the other hand, the iPhone was a paradigm shift. It was more of a mobile computer than a mobile phone.\u201dBut the tactics are evolving as the law and technology change.Companies like Nokia and Ericsson, which once had an interest in exchanging mutual licenses with other companies for their own cellphone businesses, left the handset market and concentrated on other tech gear and licensing their old patents. Nokia and Ericsson each make more than a billion dollars a year from licensing their patents and brands globally, their annual reports say.Nokia has split its patent portfolio and transferred slices to so-called patent trolls \u2014 a derisive term for companies that buy others\u2019 intellectual property and often file lawsuits to extract royalties from patent users \u2014 with Nokia sharing in any profits.\u201cUnfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple\u2019s own inventions they had nothing to do with,\u201d Apple said in a statement about the case.In response, Nokia filed legal cases against Apple in 14 venues, from Texas to Japan, on Wednesday and Thursday, accusing it of violating 40 patents. Nokia said it had reached patent deals with more than 100 other companies, including many smartphone makers, which demonstrated that it had offered its intellectual property at a fair price.\u201cAfter several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple\u2019s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights,\u201d Ilkka Rahnasto, the head of Nokia\u2019s patent business, said in a statement.Analysts say there is no doubt that Nokia owns important patents, which include those related to how phones transmit data and how their batteries consume energy.\u201cUnless there\u2019s a fair return on this technology, the whole model for the telecom world is at risk,\u201d Gustav Brismark, Ericsson\u2019s chief intellectual property officer, said. He added that the company had invested billions of dollars over decades in its patents.In the past, Mr. Brismark said, companies quickly reached agreements over how to use Ericsson\u2019s patents. But in the past five years, companies like Apple have more often turned to courts to reach settlements.As Nokia seeks to require Apple to pay to license more of its patents, some of its recent claims may be hard to justify. In one of its lawsuits filed on Wednesday, it says Apple is violating a patent Nokia received two months ago for an electronic device case that includes a hole for a camera lens in the back and room for a battery beneath the display, features that have been common to smartphones for many years.Still, Mr. Roberts said American courts have been skeptical of patent-related antitrust claims like those by Apple. \u201cThe whole point of the government granting these patents is that it was giving the inventor a monopoly over that invention,\u201d he said.But Apple and Nokia are fighters, and too much is at stake for either to give up easily.\u201cWhat is a fair return on technology that has been shared with everyone?\u201d Mr. Brismark of Ericsson said. \u201cYou have to create the right incentives for tech pioneers.\u201dVindu Goel reported from San Francisco and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Gives Samsung a Reprieve in Apple Patent Case", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byA federal law says that companies found liable for infringing design patents on an \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, turned on the meaning of the quoted phrase.Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers \u2014 here, Samsung\u2019s phones \u2014 and sometimes be the components found to have infringed a design patent.\u201cAll told,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote, \u201cApple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung\u2019s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.\u201dDesign patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in over a century.\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the appellate court said.Justice Sotomayor\u2019s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the whole phone or just parts of it. She said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that \u201cthe relevant \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 must always be the end product sold to the consumer.\u201d\u201cIn the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote. \u201cIn the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.\u201dThe Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration, drawing out the final resolution of a case that has transfixed Silicon Valley since it was filed in 2011.Technology companies often imitate innovations made by their rivals and incorporate hundreds or thousands of patented ideas in a new product. The largest companies often cross-license their patents to one another to minimize infringement claims.The Supreme Court battle between Apple and Samsung centered on what happens when the infringement involves just a few features of a product\u2019s design.Apple \u2014 backed by dozens of independent designers as well as fashion-focused companies like Nike and Tiffany \u2014 argued that design is central to many products and that a patent violator should be forced to turn over the full profits it made from infringing designs.Samsung \u2014 whose position was backed by Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, eBay and HP \u2014 argued that any penalties should be proportionate to the importance of the infringing features to the overall product.The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, while not decisively resolving the case, found that liability in design patent cases is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition. But the justices declined to offer more specific guidance. So now Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the smartphone market, will go back to court to wrangle over the appropriate amount of damages for Samsung\u2019s infringement.In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said, \u201cOur case has always been about Samsung\u2019s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\u2019t right.\u201dA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\u201dJustice Sotomayor\u2019s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. \u201cAn \u2018article\u2019 is just \u2018a particular thing,\u2019\u201d she wrote, citing two dictionaries. \u201cAnd \u2018manufacture\u2019 means \u2018the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man\u2019 and \u2018the articles so made.\u2019\u201cAn article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,\u201d she concluded. \u201cSo understood, the term \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.\u201dPatent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\u201cThe court basically punted,\u201d said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. \u201cIt seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to tell you what the right rule is.\u2019\u201dMr. Lemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Officials Accuse Facebook of Misleading Them on WhatsApp Deal", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byThe accusation, which could lead to a fine of up to 1 percent of Facebook\u2019s yearly revenue, meaning a penalty of about $200 million, comes amid growing tension with Europe\u2019s policy makers over how the company is able to dominate much of the region\u2019s digital world.The company denies all of the allegations, but says it is doing more to remove fake news articles and posts that promote hate speech.On Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, said Facebook had misled regulators in 2014 when it bought WhatsApp. She said the company did not outline its plans to match people\u2019s Facebook accounts with those on the popular messaging app, which now has more than a billion users worldwide.Yet Ms. Vestager said the potential of such linking was not explained when the social network sought regulatory approval for the purchase, despite questioning from European officials.By subsequently adding the data sharing to its wider digital offerings, she said, Facebook misled officials, since the company already had the ability to match people\u2019s accounts when the takeover was first announced.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook said that it had acted in good faith when seeking approval of the deal from European regulators, and that the company had contacted the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, at the start of this year about its new plans to match people\u2019s accounts.\u201cWe respect the commission\u2019s process,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman, Sally Aldous, said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate and share information officials need to resolve their questions.\u201dFacebook has until the end of next month to respond to the European competition charges and there is no fixed deadline for the authorities in Brussels to make a decision in the case. Any legal appeal against the potential ruling could take years to resolve.Twelve years ago, the commission raised the maximum allowable fine to the current level of 1 percent of annual revenue to dissuade companies from misleading regulators during mergers.Despite having brought similar cases against other companies, the commission has never imposed the potentially higher fines. The previous record in such a case dates to 1999, when the commission fined the German postal operator Deutsche Post 100,000 euros, or about $105,000 at current exchange rates, for two offenses. At the time, the maximum fine for each offense was \u20ac50,000.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Despite the new regulatory standoff, Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp is not in question. Any European decision against Facebook would not restrict the increasing dominance that the social network and WhatsApp have over how people in the Western world communicate.Facebook\u2019s plans to link WhatsApp to its increasingly powerful online advertising business model have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe, which has some of the toughest privacy and competition rules.The company still shares people\u2019s digital information in the United States and elsewhere, although privacy campaigners have filed legal challenges with the Federal Trade Commission.European policy makers say that they are protecting the region\u2019s 500 million people from potential harmful acts by these dominant American companies, though industry executives have often accused the region\u2019s lawmakers of unfairly targeting Silicon Valley giants to promote European rivals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great A.I. Awakening", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "FeatureHow Google used artificial intelligence to transform Google Translate, one of its more popular services \u2014 and how machine learning is poised to reinvent computing itself.Supported byLate one Friday night in early November, Jun Rekimoto, a distinguished professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Tokyo, was online preparing for a lecture when he began to notice some peculiar posts rolling in on social media. Apparently Google Translate, the company\u2019s popular machine-translation service, had suddenly and almost immeasurably improved. Rekimoto visited Translate himself and began to experiment with it. He was astonished. He had to go to sleep, but Translate refused to relax its grip on his imagination.Rekimoto wrote up his initial findings in a blog post. First, he compared a few sentences from two published versions of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Takashi Nozaki\u2019s 1957 translation and Haruki Murakami\u2019s more recent iteration, with what this new Google Translate was able to produce. Murakami\u2019s translation is written \u201cin very polished Japanese,\u201d Rekimoto explained to me later via email, but the prose is distinctively \u201cMurakami-style.\u201d By contrast, Google\u2019s translation \u2014 despite some \u201csmall unnaturalness\u201d \u2014 reads to him as \u201cmore transparent.\u201dThe second half of Rekimoto\u2019s post examined the service in the other direction, from Japanese to English. He dashed off his own Japanese interpretation of the opening to Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,\u201d then ran that passage back through Google into English. He published this version alongside Hemingway\u2019s original, and proceeded to invite his readers to guess which was the work of a machine.NO. 1:Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai \u201cNgaje Ngai,\u201d the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.NO. 2:Kilimanjaro is a mountain of 19,710 feet covered with snow and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. The summit of the west is called \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in Masai, the house of God. Near the top of the west there is a dry and frozen dead body of leopard. No one has ever explained what leopard wanted at that altitude.Even to a native English speaker, the missing article on the leopard is the only real giveaway that No. 2 was the output of an automaton. Their closeness was a source of wonder to Rekimoto, who was well acquainted with the capabilities of the previous service. Only 24 hours earlier, Google would have translated the same Japanese passage as follows:Kilimanjaro is 19,710 feet of the mountain covered with snow, and it is said that the highest mountain in Africa. Top of the west, \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in the Maasai language, has been referred to as the house of God. The top close to the west, there is a dry, frozen carcass of a leopard. Whether the leopard had what the demand at that altitude, there is no that nobody explained.Rekimoto promoted his discovery to his hundred thousand or so followers on Twitter, and over the next few hours thousands of people broadcast their own experiments with the machine-translation service. Some were successful, others meant mostly for comic effect. As dawn broke over Tokyo, Google Translate was the No. 1 trend on Japanese Twitter, just above some cult anime series and the long-awaited new single from a girl-idol supergroup. Everybody wondered: How had Google Translate become so uncannily artful?Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, stood to make a few opening remarks. A friend, he began, had recently told him he reminded him of Google. \u201cWhy, because I know all the answers?\u201d the mayor asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the friend replied, \u201cbecause you\u2019re always trying to finish my sentences.\u201d The crowd tittered politely. Khan concluded by introducing Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who took the stage.Pichai was in London in part to inaugurate Google\u2019s new building there, the cornerstone of a new \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d under construction at King\u2019s Cross, and in part to unveil the completion of the initial phase of a company transformation he announced last year. The Google of the future, Pichai had said on several occasions, was going to be \u201cA.I. first.\u201d What that meant in theory was complicated and had welcomed much speculation. What it meant in practice, with any luck, was that soon the company\u2019s products would no longer represent the fruits of traditional computer programming, exactly, but \u201cmachine learning.\u201dA rarefied department within the company, Google Brain, was founded five years ago on this very principle: that artificial \u201cneural networks\u201d that acquaint themselves with the world via trial and error, as toddlers do, might in turn develop something like human flexibility. This notion is not new \u2014 a version of it dates to the earliest stages of modern computing, in the 1940s \u2014 but for much of its history most computer scientists saw it as vaguely disreputable, even mystical. Since 2011, though, Google Brain has demonstrated that this approach to artificial intelligence could solve many problems that confounded decades of conventional efforts. Speech recognition didn\u2019t work very well until Brain undertook an effort to revamp it; the application of machine learning made its performance on Google\u2019s mobile platform, Android, almost as good as human transcription. The same was true of image recognition. Less than a year ago, Brain for the first time commenced with the gut renovation of an entire consumer product, and its momentous results were being celebrated tonight.Translate made its debut in 2006 and since then has become one of Google\u2019s most reliable and popular assets; it serves more than 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day in a different language. It exists not only as its own stand-alone app but also as an integrated feature within Gmail, Chrome and many other Google offerings, where we take it as a push-button given \u2014 a frictionless, natural part of our digital commerce. It was only with the refugee crisis, Pichai explained from the lectern, that the company came to reckon with Translate\u2019s geopolitical importance: On the screen behind him appeared a graph whose steep curve indicated a recent fivefold increase in translations between Arabic and German. (It was also close to Pichai\u2019s own heart. He grew up in India, a land divided by dozens of languages.) The team had been steadily adding new languages and features, but gains in quality over the last four years had slowed considerably.Until today. As of the previous weekend, Translate had been converted to an A.I.-based system for much of its traffic, not just in the United States but in Europe and Asia as well: The rollout included translations between English and Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. The rest of Translate\u2019s hundred-odd languages were to come, with the aim of eight per month, by the end of next year. The new incarnation, to the pleasant surprise of Google\u2019s own engineers, had been completed in only nine months. The A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime.Grinning, Pichai read aloud an awkward English version of the sentence that had been rendered by the old Translate system: \u201cOne is not what is for what he writes, but for what he has read.\u201dTo the right of that was a new A.I.-rendered version: \u201cYou are not what you write, but what you have read.\u201dIt was a fitting remark: The new Google Translate was run on the first machines that had, in a sense, ever learned to read anything at all.The phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is invoked as if its meaning were self-evident, but it has always been a source of confusion and controversy. Imagine if you went back to the 1970s, stopped someone on the street, pulled out a smartphone and showed her Google Maps. Once you managed to convince her you weren\u2019t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\u2019t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \u2014 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \u201cA.I.,\u201d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d are thus constantly receding.The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Facebook\u2019s M, Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\u2019t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer. Management consultants are falling all over themselves to prep executives for the widening industrial applications of computers that program themselves. DeepMind, a 2014 Google acquisition, defeated the reigning human grandmaster of the ancient board game Go, despite predictions that such an achievement would take another 10 years.It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\u2019s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \u2014 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \u2014 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \u2014 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\u2019s \u201cmicrokitchens\u201d \u2014 the \u201cGoogley\u201d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\u2019s buildings \u2014 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \u201cneural networks,\u201d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\u2019s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\u2019s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \u201c20 percent\u201d \u2014 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \u2014 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \u201cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\u201d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\u2019s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\u2019s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\u2019s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \u201cminister of agriculture\u201d as \u201cpriest of farming.\u201d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d better than math and chess.There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\u2019t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.There has always been another vision for A.I. \u2014 a dissenting view \u2014 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\u2019t. What\u2019s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\u2019t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \u2014 sensory perception and motor control \u2014 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\u2019t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \u2014 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 and drew upon both the company\u2019s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \u2014 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.\u201cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\u201d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \u201cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\u2019ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\u201d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\u2019s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \u201cType in your LDAP\u201d \u2014 a user login \u2014 and he would flag a helper to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s an LDAP?\u201d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \u201cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\u2019t he get it?\u201d\u201cAt lunchtime,\u201d Hinton said, \u201csomeone in the queue yelled: \u2018Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\u2019 After that, it was all right.\u201dHinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\u2019s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \u201cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\u201dHinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\u2019s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \u201cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\u2019d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \u2014 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \u2014 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.The issue with multilayered, \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\u2019s easy. Imagine that you\u2019re playing with a child. You tell the child, \u201cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\u201d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \u201cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\u201d The child tries Box A. Bravo.These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \u201cconnectionism\u201d or \u201cparallel distributed processing.\u201d \u201cThis idea,\u201d Hinton told me, \u201cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\u2019s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\u2019\u2009It wasn\u2019t a very persuasive argument.\u201dTo understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\u2019re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\u2019t how they work. All they\u2019re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \u2014 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \u2014 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\u2019re feeding them is biased in the first place.If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \u201ccat.\u201d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \u201cNot cat.\u201d It is hyperliteral, or \u201cbrittle.\u201d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \u201cvoters,\u201d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \u201cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\u201d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \u201cA dog?\u201dYou say: \u201cNo, maestro, it\u2019s a cat. Try again.\u201dNow the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \u201ccat\u201d and which didn\u2019t. The ones that got \u201ccat\u201d right get their votes counted double next time \u2014 at least when they\u2019re voting for \u201ccat.\u201d They have to prove independently whether they\u2019re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\u2019s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\u2019s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\u2019s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\u2019s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \u201cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \u2018cats.\u2019\u2009\u201d The more \u201cvoters\u201d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \u2014 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\u2019s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\u2019s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \u201cdumbbell\u201d but the concept of \u201cdumbbell+arm,\u201d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\u2019s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\u2019s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?\u201cBut actually,\u201d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \u201cit\u2019s very hard.\u201d\u201cThere was a big debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cA very big debate.\u201d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\u2019d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a big debate.\u201dHe remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \u201cThis is the future.\u201d It was, he said, an \u201cunpopular decision at the time.\u201d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\u2019t quite understand Le\u2019s decision. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked Le in an email.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good answer back then,\u201d Le said. \u201cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\u201d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\u2019s ideas. \u201cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\u201dWhat happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \u2014 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\u2019t specify what it should or shouldn\u2019t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \u201cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\u201d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \u201csummarize\u201d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \u2014 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \u2014 the machine couldn\u2019t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\u2019s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \u201cchose\u201d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\u2019t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.Le didn\u2019t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\u2019t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\u2019s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\u2019s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\u2019t help myself and began to ask, \u201cIs he ... ?\u201d Le nodded. \u201cAt Facebook,\u201d he replied.)The hundred or so current members of Brain \u2014 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \u2014 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\u2019s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)When I began spending time at Brain\u2019s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \u201cJesse, 6/27.\u201d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.Brain\u2019s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \u201csuccess disaster\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the company\u2019s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.\u201cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis is how many machines we\u2019ll need.\u201d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.\u201cThat,\u201d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \u201csounded scary. You\u2019d have to\u201d \u2014 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \u2014 \u201cbuild new buildings.\u201dThere was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \u201ctensor processing units,\u201d and their value proposition \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\u2019s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \u201cNormally,\u201d Dean said, \u201cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\u201dLe\u2019s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \u2014 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\u2019s model didn\u2019t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\u2019t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \u201cYou think,\u201d Schuster says, \u201cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\u2019re done, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201dThe issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\u2019s code was custom-written, and it wasn\u2019t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\u2019s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\u2019t always make heads or tails of what they had done.As Schuster put it, \u201cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\u2019t know themselves why they worked.\u201dThis February, Google\u2019s research organization \u2014 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \u2014 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\u2019s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \u201clightning talks,\u201d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \u201cfacilitated discussions.\u201d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \u201cWe ambushed him.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \u201cWe have something to tell you.\u201dThey told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \u2014 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \u2014 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \u201cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\u201d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\u2019t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\u2019s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\u2019s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \u2014 and something akin to meaning.Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \u2014 not in a lab but at production scale \u2014 for years, to little avail.Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.Dean thought otherwise. \u201cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\u201d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \u201cif we put our minds to it.\u201dHughes was sure the conversion wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\u2019t personally care to be the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s prepare for 2016,\u201d he went back and told his team. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\u2019t deliver speed.\u201dA month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\u2019s new system with Hughes\u2019s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \u201cEnglish-French,\u201d he said, \u201cis so good that the improvement won\u2019t be obvious.\u201dIt was a challenge Schuster couldn\u2019t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.Hughes told Schuster\u2019s team they hadn\u2019t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.To be sure this wasn\u2019t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \u2014 Schuster, Wu and Chen \u2014 but with Hughes\u2019s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\u2019s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\u2019s case there was no ambiguity.The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \u201cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\u201d Schuster told me at one point. \u201cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\u201d \u2014 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \u2014 \u201cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\u201d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\u2019s there.\u201dMost of Google\u2019s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.\u201cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\u201dThe theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \u2014 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \u201cmere\u201d engineering \u2014 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\u2019s billions of words of training \u201creading\u201d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \u201cwords.\u201d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\u2019t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \u201cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\u2019s like a toddler. \u2018Oh, Daddy says that word when he\u2019s mad!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201dMore than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\u2019t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\u2019t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\u2019t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\u2019t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\u2019s service.Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\u2019t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t know to make it fast enough, but I don\u2019t know what it could be.\u201dHe did know, though, that they needed more computers \u2014 \u201cG.P.U.s,\u201d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \u2014 for training.Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \u201cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\u201dSchuster said, \u201cWhy not 2,000?\u201dTen days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \u2014 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \u201cPeople were almost yelling,\u201d Schuster said.By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \u201cword-piece model,\u201d a \u201ccoverage penalty,\u201d \u201clength normalization.\u201d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \u2014 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \u2014 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?\u201cWe did hundreds of experiments,\u201d Schuster told me, \u201cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\u2019re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\u2019m done? You never know you\u2019re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\u2019s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\u2019s hard for some people. It\u2019s a little bit an art \u2014 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\u201dThe Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \u201cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \u2018Oh, I did something first,\u2019 but who cares, in the end?\u201dThis did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\u2019t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a new system yet,\u201d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \u201cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\u2019s exploding on Twitter: \u2018Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.Google\u2019s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\u2019s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\u2019s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \u201cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\u201d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \u2014 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \u201ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\u201dTheir neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \u201cstep function forward\u201d \u2014 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.\u201cTo communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand cooperation!\u201dThe engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \u201cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\u201dEveryone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\u2019t.Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\u2019s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \u201cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\u201d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \u201cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\u201dFor the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\u2019t assume that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \u2014 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\u2019re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\u2019s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a machine \u2018knows\u2019 or \u2018understands\u2019 but what it \u2018does,\u2019 and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 what it doesn\u2019t do yet.\u201dWhere you come down on \u201cknowing\u201d versus \u201cdoing\u201d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\u2019s media reception. \u201cDid you see the first press?\u201d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\u2019. Over the final weeks of the paper\u2019s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\u201d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\u2019t about replacing people but helping them.And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \u201cinsight,\u201d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\u2019s antagonists, you can\u2019t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\u2019t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s causing the cancer.Then again, can the radiologist?Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \u2014 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\u2019re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\u2019re just telling you it\u2019s there.Once you\u2019ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \u2014 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \u2014 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \u2014 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\u2019re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\u2019re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\u2019s institution-building \u2014 and the consolidation of power \u2014 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \u201cninja\u201d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \u2014 for they\u2019re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \u2014 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \u2014 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\u2019s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, \u201cSo when do we get to delete it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe new code base is going to grow. Everything grows.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a computer used in space travel. A computer was used to guide Apollo missions \u2014 not the \u201cApollo shuttle.\u201d (There was no such shuttle.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mario, Nintendo\u2019s Mustachioed Gaming Legend, Arrives on iPhones", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 What happens when one of the best-selling games in history comes to the most popular category of electronic devices in the world? A mustachioed plumber in overalls is about to reveal the answer.On Thursday, after nearly a decade of doing its best to ignore the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets, Nintendo is finally bringing a game based on its beloved character Mario to mobile devices.People have been able to play Mario games on portable devices made by Nintendo since the early 1980s, but the release of the new Super Mario Run represents the first time Nintendo has put out an installment for devices made by another company \u2014 in this case, iPhones and iPads from Apple.Releasing Mario on phones and tablets was once an unthinkable move for a quirky company that had for years insisted that making both game software and the hardware it ran on was essential to its magic.Nintendo finally relented as general-purpose mobile devices increasingly cut into sales of its portable game players. Other games publishers filled the void on mobile devices left by Nintendo, threatening to erode the relevance of its game properties, including Zelda and Donkey Kong, for a new generation of players.\u201cThey\u2019ve really let their brand wilt the last few years,\u201d said David Cole, a games analyst with DFC Intelligence. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve seen how strong that brand still is. There is potential to bring it back.\u201d\u201cWe remain confident that the play style means that the game can be played in a wide range of locations and situations,\u201d Kit Ellis, a Nintendo spokesman, said in an emailed statement.Nintendo is also pricing the game in an unconventional way for the mobile market. While it will allow players to sample portions of Super Mario Run for free, Nintendo will charge $9.99 for full access to the game. A vast majority of mobile games are free, but some provide players with opportunities to pay $1 or more for useful items inside a game or for access to new challenges.Only a few mobile games \u2014 Minecraft is one notable example \u2014 have successfully charged as much as Nintendo plans to, analysts said.Mitch Lasky, a venture capitalist with Benchmark and a longtime investor in games companies, said the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go shows how much pent-up demand there is for Nintendo properties on devices made by other companies. He also said he was encouraged that Shigeru Miyamoto, the renowned Nintendo game designer who created Mario and other Nintendo classics, had a hand in Super Mario Run.\u201cI think Mr. Miyamoto is the greatest game designer of his generation, and his apparent involvement on Run gives it a ton of credibility,\u201d Mr. Lasky said.\u201cThis is unprecedented marketing support from Apple,\u201d said Randy Nelson, the head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, a mobile analytics firm. He predicted Super Mario Run would be \u201cin terms of downloads, the largest app launch in history.\u201dWith so many new games arriving on mobile phones, keeping players engaged is always a challenge. Even Pok\u00e9mon Go faded after the initial hype. According to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm, 23 million Americans played it at least once in November, down from 66 million in July.\u201cIt\u2019s probably more of a sideshow in their overall strategy,\u201d said Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research. \u201cI don\u2019t think Nintendo is getting out of the hardware game.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Music: Platform? Promoter? Both.", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBy all modern metrics, Drake was far and away the most listened-to artist of 2016, a year when music consumers further abandoned CDs and paid downloads, and turned increasingly to streaming services.The rapper saw staggering numbers from FM radio to Spotify, where songs from his album \u201cViews\u201d were streamed more than three billion times since their April release, but it was Drake\u2019s exhaustive synergy with Apple Music, where \u201cViews\u201d was played another few billion times, that best illustrated the recent paradigm shifts in the music industry \u2014 and signaled where things may yet be headed. (According to Nielsen Music, on-demand streaming now accounts for a larger share of total business \u2014 38 percent \u2014 than physical sales, digital album sales or track downloads.)Since its debut in the summer of 2015, however, Apple Music has separated itself from Spotify, the industry\u2019s streaming leader, by trying to become a one-stop shop for major artists \u2014 part platform and part promoter.Then there were Drake\u2019s commercials with Taylor Swift.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody could argue against the incredible value of Apple marketing,\u201d said David Bakula, a senior music analyst for Nielsen. \u201cThere are artists they latch onto and say, \u2018This is something we are going to heavily promote.\u2019 It makes one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world a sort of tastemaker.\u201dThis strategy was not driven so much by Silicon Valley thinkers as record label veterans \u2014 namely the Apple Music executives Jimmy Iovine, a former producer who was a founder of Interscope and Beats by Dr. Dre, and Larry Jackson, a onetime A&R man who signed acts like Chief Keef and Lana Del Rey.\u201cWe have real understanding of what these artists are trying to accomplish both aesthetically and commercially,\u201d Mr. Iovine said. At Apple, \u201cWe\u2019re really getting there in merging these cultures \u2014 tech and the arts,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to prove that we are the best place for an artist to fulfill their vision.\u201dIn interviews this month, Mr. Iovine and Mr. Jackson, the quietly influential pair behind the delivery of some of pop music\u2019s most notable 2016 moments, discussed Apple\u2019s place in the music ecosystem and what the future of streaming may hold. These are edited excerpts from those conversations.What did you learn in 2016 that you didn\u2019t realize at the beginning of the year?From my perspective and from Jimmy\u2019s, we\u2019ve always had a very strong knack for signing and nurturing hip-hop and R&B acts. The thing I find more interesting now is: What\u2019s the new pop? Pop has always been considered to be one thing, if you know what I\u2019m saying. But when I look at the top albums of the year \u2014 it\u2019s Drake, Beyonc\u00e9, J. Cole, Frank Ocean and the Weeknd \u2014 all black artists. How is that not pop? You don\u2019t really hear Frank Ocean or J. Cole on pop radio, but streaming has ushered in what the new pop is.There was an idea this year, especially after Frank Ocean released \u201cBlonde\u201d independently through Apple, that you were stepping in where traditional labels may have fallen behind. We do a different thing than labels. They manage hundreds of groups. We don\u2019t, nor could we. We are a platform that works between the artist, the label and the consumer. The day I met Steve Jobs and [the Apple executive] Eddy Cue, I immediately harnessed it for Interscope. I wasn\u2019t threatened by it. The labels need to have people who know how to harness these things and not just say, \u201cPut me on a playlist,\u201d and pray for rain.Have the labels successfully harnessed your platform this year?Some see Apple Music as benefiting only the artistic 1 percent. What\u2019s the best use of the platform for those not on the tier of a Drake or Chance?Were A-list exclusives the most effective way to add subscribers?Is there a concern that the fragmentation of the streaming market, and especially exclusives, incentivizes people to download music illegally?Do you regret how the Frank Ocean situation played out, given the perception that you were party to a fast one being pulled on Def Jam and Universal Music?Why would an artist like Drake ever sign a record contract again given what he\u2019s getting from Apple? Or even someone at the beginning of their career, like Chance?What do the labels do best right now that Apple Music can\u2019t? Was Kanye\u2019s \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d close to happening with Apple before he ultimately went exclusive with Tidal?Are there albums or artists that you feel like you missed out on? Is there any sort of blood feud between Apple, Spotify and Tidal? Do you think we\u2019ll eventually see a consolidation of these services, or will we continue to see an expansion?How important is it for you to have a creative relationship with artists in addition to a business relationship?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Change Their Tone on AT&T and Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byAt a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that was being closely watched for how mega-mergers will be viewed in the coming Trump administration, members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees regulatory agencies that decide on mergers said the deal merited tough scrutiny. The chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner were grilled at the hearing about a range of issues related to the deal.But in a change from previous comments, lawmakers also questioned whether traditional ways of evaluating mergers are growing outdated as Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google become massive media platforms that threaten the television industry. Their tone was more circumspect than those that immediately followed the deal\u2019s announcement, when lawmakers had been more critical.\u201cWe want to ensure that competition thrives in this critical market and we don\u2019t stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who heads the full Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley said Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have transformed the video landscape.Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, said the deal would combine companies that did not directly compete against one another. \u201cThe consumer is benefited from the aggregation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is called capitalism.\u201dOver all, senators were asking \u201chard questions,\u201d said Larry Downes, a professor at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough School of Business. But, he added, \u201cthey seem to be open-minded about the changing nature of competition in the information sector.\u201dAT&T, a telecom giant, and Time Warner, which owns CNN and HBO, had said in October that AT&T would buy Time Warner to create a mobile video powerhouse. The hearing may have implications beyond this deal, with the comments potentially encouraging more acquisitions by companies that have been waiting out the Obama administration, which has rejected several mergers.\u201cThe D.O.J. pays particularly close attention to Senate and House antitrust subcommittees because they oversee the D.O.J.,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company, who added that the committee\u2019s commentary \u201cbears watching for its potential effect on the D.O.J.\u201d Members of the Justice Department attended the hearing.When the deal was announced, days before the presidential election, leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued strong cautionary statements about it. Donald J. Trump, on the campaign trail at the time, said he would block the merger if elected. He has singled out CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner, with particular rancor for its election coverage.As president, Mr. Trump will have no direct power over mergers, but he will greatly influence which ones are approved, depending on whom he picks to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust or the chairman of the F.C.C. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, told CNBC before the hearing that he had not had contact with the Trump transition team.During the hearing, the companies pitched a message that catered to the new administration: a populist promise of lower prices and the potential to build more wireless infrastructure through the merger. While AT&T and Time Warner are powerhouses, they presented themselves as weaker rivals to the cable industry and Silicon Valley tech companies.Mr. Stephenson said in prepared remarks that cable companies dominated the broadband and television market, serving high-speed internet to eight of every 10 American homes that have broadband service. To experiment with new mobile video technologies, he said, AT&T needed to have in-house content to quickly try new streaming services at a lower cost. He added that AT&T had just introduced a streaming service with 100 channels for less than most cable television packages.\u201cIt is only the beginning of what we want to bring to the marketplace to threaten cable\u2019s entrenched and still-dominant market position,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. He said AT&T would give CNN editorial independence if the merger were approved.Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, \u201cIt is not enough to deliver great content.\u201d The companies\u2019 competitors have multiplied, he said.No lawmakers at the hearing said the merger should be blocked, but several expressed skepticism.\u201cI have serious concerns about this transaction,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.

Streaming providers like Sling TV and Hulu would face a major new competitor, with AT&T\u2019s access to 110 million wireless and satellite subscribers and premium television networks under the same roof, the groups said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Parent Company Spins Off Self-Driving Car Business", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s self-driving car is ready to take the wheel.Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, said on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company under the name Waymo.Alphabet\u2019s decision to spin out Waymo is a signal that the company thinks its self-driving technology has advanced beyond research project status and is ready for commercialization.Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers \u2014 all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry.Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning \u2014 the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time \u2014 mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years.\u201cAs we look at this space and the opportunities ahead of us, we see so much,\u201d said John Krafcik, chief executive of Waymo. \u201cWe\u2019re a new company, but we\u2019ve been at this for a while.\u201dWaymo joins the roster of Alphabet companies, which includes Google. Mr. Krafcik said the new arrangement allows Waymo to tap into the infrastructure and resources of Alphabet with the feel of an independent venture-backed company. He said Waymo\u2019s technology could have uses as varied as ride-sharing services and long-haul trucking, but he did not lay out a specific business strategy.Alphabet was an early technological leader in the field, but its efforts to establish a business around the technology have fallen short. Since 2009, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving cars have logged 2.3 million driverless miles \u2014 the equivalent of more than 400 round-trip drives from New York to Los Angeles \u2014 on test drives in California, Arizona, Texas and Washington state. Waymo said it completed the world\u2019s first fully driverless ride on public roads last year in Austin, Texas, with a blind passenger in a car without a steering wheel or pedals.Safely ensconced in Google\u2019s so-called moonshot factory, the self-driving car project did not face the type of financial pressure to commercialize its technology that a start-up or a company without Google\u2019s resources would have. Despite its head start, other companies have incorporated autonomous driving technology into their products and services more quickly.For Google, the goal was to design a vehicle that is responsible for 100 percent of the driving. The company said this approach was more difficult and would take more time. However, Google said it was ultimately safer than semiautonomous vehicles, which may require a driver to take back control of the car without awareness of the surroundings.Waymo said its ultimate goal was to equip its driverless system on cars without steering wheels or pedals because it didn\u2019t want humans to feel as if they needed to monitor the vehicle. However, government regulations currently require a vehicle to have steering wheels and pedals.In August 2015, Google brought in Mr. Krafcik, a former Hyundai Motor executive, to lead the project and bring it closer to commercialization. It has also lost crucial personnel on the project, sometimes to competitors.\u201cGoogle has struggled to find a way to come to market,\u201d said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where Google needs a return.\u201dThe challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesn\u2019t have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares \u2014 at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesn\u2019t have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain.It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems \u2014 akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google.This year, Google reached a deal with Fiat Chrysler to equip its automated driving systems in 100 Pacifica minivans to try to make it easier for the technology to be installed on an assembly line.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really clear that we\u2019re not a car company,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of making better cars. We\u2019re in the business of making better drivers.\u201dThe technology site The Information reported earlier that Waymo was considering building a ride-sharing network with the minivans. When asked about that possibility, Mr. Krafcik said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dIt\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s also about data. Without a way of getting its systems on the road through a ride-sharing network or an automaker, Google may struggle to collect valuable on-the-road information \u2014 a crucial part of helping its driving systems learn and improve over time.Dmitri Dolgov, who oversees the development of self-driving technology for Waymo, said the next step for his team would be to make the ride for driverless cars smoother and more natural, build out the map system to allow it to go to more places, and handle different weather conditions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Play the Trump Stock Market Rally", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byFundamentally\u201cIf you have big tax cuts and more infrastructure and defense spending, that adds to demand, which is likely to spell inflation,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds.That is partly why shares of big banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase and blue-chip industrial companies like Caterpillar and General Dynamics have surged since election night.But after more than a month of this rally, value-minded investors think it may be time to start looking for bargains in areas of the market that have been left behind.\u201cThe biggest opportunity is in the international markets,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \u201cThose stocks are getting pounded by one big factor \u2014 the dollar.\u201dA strong dollar not only reduces the value of gains that Americans enjoy on their overseas investments, but it also serves as a headwind to domestic companies as a strengthening currency makes their goods more expensive to foreign buyers.In the immediate aftermath of the election, the dollar surged as much as 4 percent against a basket of foreign currencies, on the belief that market interest rates in the United States would keep rising and the Federal Reserve would start lifting short-term rates, too. Both moves would provide greater incentives for global investors to park their cash in dollar-denominated assets.But Mr. Paulsen looked at the start of the last five periods in which the Federal Reserve began a sustained campaign to raise short-term rates. \u201cEvery one of those times was associated with a decline in the dollar,\u201d he said, not a rise.While it\u2019s true that rising bond yields can strengthen the dollar, rates are often raised to stave off inflation, and that can hurt a currency. If the Federal Reserve starts hiking rates this month because it sees a need to quell inflation, that could weaken the dollar, Mr. Paulsen said.\u201cIf the dollar comes down,\u201d he said, \u201cthat definitely brings the foreign markets, particularly the emerging markets, into play.\u201dLewis J. Altfest, chief investment officer for Altfest Personal Wealth Management, concurs with this logic and is adding to his investments in emerging market equities, he said, especially after they\u2019ve taken another hit. Since the Nov. 8 election, emerging market shares such as the Chinese internet giant Tencent have fallen, while a broad range of shares in the American market have gained.Historically, emerging market stocks have traded at roughly a 15 percent discount to United States shares based on price/earnings ratios that rely on five years of averaged profits, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group.Today, that has widened to a near 50 percent discount.Emerging market stocks weren\u2019t the only investments that had taken a hit because of rising interest rates lately.In the aftermath of the election, the yield on 10-year Treasuries jumped to 2.4 percent, while 30-year Treasury yields rose to 3.1 percent. Both are up a full percentage point from their levels this summer, which helps to explain why the average long-term government bond mutual fund fell more than 7 percent in the month after the election.In any case, bond investors may have overreacted in selling.The same goes for Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s speculation about new longer-dated bonds. It could take years for the Treasury to actually issue such bonds, Ms. Jones said, and as that realization takes hold and selling slows down, there may be some short-term opportunities in Treasuries, she added.Investors may want to consider sectors that have underperformed during this postelection surge, even if they haven\u2019t declined.Take technology. American tech stocks haven\u2019t moved much since election night.Why? Conventional wisdom said that the new president\u2019s views on immigration and trade would hurt tech companies the most, in part because these firms generate a greater portion of their sales overseas \u2014 58 percent \u2014 than any other sector of the market, according to FactSet, a financial research firm.But Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank, said the Trump administration\u2019s incipient economic goals appear to be threefold. \u201cThe first is to grow the economic pie, and then to widen the slices of both wages for workers and profits for companies,\u201d he said.To accomplish that, the economy would need to increase productivity. \u201cUltimately, business investment has to be part of the solution, and because of that, tech will be critical,\u201d Mr. Ablin added.This may not directly help consumer-focused companies like Apple, \u201cbut this should be good news to tech companies that sell to other businesses, like Salesforce.com,\u201d Mr. Ablin said.Health care is another fertile area to consider, market strategists say. While big pharmaceutical companies rallied immediately after the election \u2014 on the assumption that a Trump administration will relax regulations \u2014 other parts of the sector have been largely flat on uncertainties surrounding the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Medical equipment stocks, for instance, have slumped on fears that if Obamacare is eliminated and fewer Americans are insured, hospitals will purchase less new equipment.\u201cHealth care is an interesting area postelection because there is still so much uncertainty about Obamacare,\u201d said Mary L. Pierson, co-manager of Fairpointe Capital\u2019s mid-cap stock strategy.Yet Ms. Pierson noted that some equipment makers are likely to grow with or without Obamacare, citing Varian Medical Systems, an equipment manufacturer based in Palo Alto, Calif., that makes devices for radiotherapy used in treating various forms of cancer. The company generates more than 50 percent of its revenues overseas. What\u2019s more, nearly 95 percent of all radiotherapy equipment installations over the next decade are expected to be handled by just two firms \u2014 Varian and its rival, Elekta.Ms. Pierson sees Varian\u2019s mediocre postelection performance as \u201can opportunity for us to add to our position.\u201dPaul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Forget AT&T. The Real Monopolies Are Google and Facebook.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner has drawn censure from both sides of the political aisle, as well as a Senate hearing that looked into the potential for the combined company to become a monopoly.But if we are going to examine media monopolies, we should look first at Silicon Valley, not the fading phone business.Mark Cuban, the internet entrepreneur, said at the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last week that the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.\u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Look at the numbers. Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Facebook are among the 10 largest companies in the world. Alphabet alone has a market capitalization of around $550 billion. AT&T and Time Warner combined would be about $300 billion.Alphabet has an 83 percent share of the mobile search market in the United States and just under 63 percent of the US mobile phone operating systems market. AT&T has a 32 percent market share in mobile phones and 26 percent in pay TV. The combined AT&T-Time Warner will have $8 billion in cash but $171 billion of net debt, according to the research company MoffettNathanson. Compare that to Alphabet\u2019s balance sheet, with total cash of $76 billion and total debt of about $3.94 billion.In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, according to Brian Nowak, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.Google and Facebook can achieve huge net profit margins because they dominate the content made available on the web while making very little of it themselves. Instead, they both have built their advertising businesses as \u201cfree riders\u201d on content made by others, some of it from Time Warner. The rise of these digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries of our country.Every pirated music video or song posted on YouTube or Facebook robs the creators of income, and YouTube in particular is dominated by unlicensed content. Google\u2019s YouTube has an over 55 percent market share in the streaming audio business and yet provides less than 11 percent of the streaming audio revenues to the content owners and creators. But Facebook, which refuses to enter into any licensing agreement on music or video, is challenging YouTube in the free online video and music world.In the past decade, an enormous reallocation of revenue of perhaps $50 billion a year has taken place, with economic value moving from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms.I reached this conclusion from the following statistics: Since 2000, recorded music revenues in the United States have fallen to $7.2 billion per year from $19.8 billion. Home entertainment video revenue fell to $18 billion in 2014 from $24.2 billion in 2006. United States newspaper ad revenue fell to $23.6 billion in 2013 from $65.8 billion in 2000.And yet, by every available metric, people are consuming more music, video, news and books. During that same period, Google\u2019s revenue grew to $74.5 billion from $400 million.The former editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, estimated that Facebook had \u201csucked up $27 million\u201d of the paper\u2019s projected digital advertising revenue in the last year by essentially keeping Guardian readers on Facebook, rather than linking them to the Guardian site.\u201cThey are taking all the money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey have algorithms we don\u2019t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it.\u201dBut the problem isn\u2019t just for musicians, authors, filmmakers or even the phone company. As the former Google \u201cdesign ethicist\u201d Tristan Harris wrote, \u201cIf you control the menu, you control the choices.\u201dWe have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the menu (Google\u2019s search rankings and Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed). How that menu is determined by these black box algorithms isn\u2019t known by anyone outside those companies. As more and more of our lives become digital, these new algorithms will assume more power over our lives.Regulators should take a hard look at the merger between AT&T and Time Warner. After the hearing on Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee, suggested that what was needed were hearings that would also include Alphabet and Facebook. She\u2019s right.But in some ways, that\u2019s just fighting the last war. We have gone through a long election cycle without any discussion about the unregulated world now dominated by a few Silicon Valley giants. Perhaps in January we can have an honest national conversation on monopoly and our future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An iPhone\u2019s Journey, From the Factory Floor to the Retail Store ", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byThe iPhone is Apple\u2019s most profitable and best-selling product. More than a billion have been sold since the first one was released. Apple buys many of the components for iPhones \u2014 like the memory chip, the modem, the camera module, the microphone and the touch-screen controller \u2014 from more than 200 suppliers around the world. Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that runs the Zhengzhou facility, even produces some smaller parts, such as metal casings.Apple orders many of the components from global suppliers, and then sells them, en masse, to one of its contract manufacturers based in China. In Zhengzhou, that means Foxconn.Foxconn\u2019s facilities in Zhengzhou cover 2.2 square miles and can employ up to 350,000 workers, many of whom earn about $1.90 an hour. The operation does what is called F.A.T.P., or final assembly, testing and packaging.The newly assembled iPhone is transported a few hundred yards beyond the factory gate, where China built a large customs facility. The customs operation sits in a so-called bonded zone, which allows Apple to sell the iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.As the final point of assembly for the iPhone, China also serves as a starting point for Apple\u2019s global tax strategy. In Zhengzhou, often in the customs facility, Foxconn sells the completed iPhones to Apple, which in turn resells them to Apple affiliates around the world.The process, most of which takes place electronically, allows Apple to assign a portion of its profits to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale. The system is not unique to China.IPhones bound for the United States and other parts of the world leave customs by truck and are transported three miles to the Zhengzhou airport. The airport has been significantly expanded in recent years, as production of the iPhone has increased.Some years ago, personal computers that were made in China were transported to the United States by container ship, with a trip lasting about a month. Smartphones are small enough to be shipped by plane in huge quantities \u2014 and cost effectively. A single wide-body Boeing 747 can easily carry 150,000 iPhones tucked into its aluminum canisters.From Zhengzhou, UPS, FedEx and other freight carriers typically fly United States-bound iPhones to Anchorage. There, they refuel, before going on to Louisville, Ky., a major logistics hub, or other points in the country.For an iPhone headed for the China market, customs officials use an electronic system to virtually stamp the goods as \u201cexports\u201d and then restamp them as \u201cimports.\u201d In Zhengzhou, the process happens in the same customs facility just outside the factory.After the iPhone leaves the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, it takes two days, on average, to get to a store in Shanghai, a 590-mile trip. It takes three days, on average, to get a store in San Francisco, some 6,300 miles away.Chinese customers can pay much higher prices, because of currency fluctuations and the country\u2019s hefty value-added tax.A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 sells for about $776 at the Apple Store in Shanghai. In New York, it goes for $649.RelatedAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Problem for Democratic Leaders Is Democratic Voters", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byLeaders on the Democratic left who want to represent the have-nots face an obstacle: their own voters.Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, argues that Democrats \u201chave to stand for a strong, populist economic message.\u201d He warns that \u201cthe way the working class is always controlled is that it\u2019s divided.\u201dA key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship, Senator Bernie Sanders, believes thatDemocrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country.a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.The problem facing Ellison, Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic electorate has actually become less receptive to populism over the past two decades.Mark Muro, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinton and those that backed Donald Trump. The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect.The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America\u2019s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015.In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection.Muro enlarged on his findings in an email:These industries encompass the nation\u2019s \u201ctech\u201d sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country\u2019s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth.The importance of these industries does not stop there:The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It\u2019s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people \u2014 those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they\u2019re going to make ends meet.Ellison\u2019s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial.In other words, as Muro made clear in his email:shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties.From 2009 to October 2016, Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm pro-trade stance, 48-37, 11 points in favor, to a decisively pro-trade position, 56-31. The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders.Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24.If anything, Trump\u2019s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade.This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas \u2014 in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.Among Democrats during this same period, Putin\u2019s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62.An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails.In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years.Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month.Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email,the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains.In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact \u2014 shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped.Although Trump\u2019s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters.Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party\u2019s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective.An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, \u201cRecent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,\u201d shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off.The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call \u201cskill downsizing.\u201d Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained.Despite Trump\u2019s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes \u2014 imports plus exports \u2014 have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent.Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreementsare not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they\u2019re about setting expansive \u201crules of the road\u201d that determine who wins and who loses.The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process:With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the \u2018winners\u2019 under these rules.Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party\u2019s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies \u2014 including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing.Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status.The nation\u2019s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks \u2014 and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation\u2019s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An (Edible) Solution to Extend Produce\u2019s Shelf Life", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported bySANTA BARBARA, Calif. \u2014 What if a Florida tomato could be left on the vine long enough to turn red and fully develop its flavor \u2014 and still be ripe and juicy when it arrived at a grocery store in New York days later?That is precisely the promise of a start-up here in Southern California, Apeel Sciences, that aims to make obsolete the gas, wax and other tricks growers use to keep fruits and vegetables fresh over time.Using leaves, stems, banana peels and other fresh plant materials left behind after fruits and vegetables are picked or processed, Apeel has developed a method for creating imperceptible, edible barriers that the company says can extend the life of produce like green beans and berries by as much as five times. Apeel can even deliver a day-of-the-week bunch of bananas, each ripening on a different day.An Apeel product already has been used to stretch the shelf life of cassava in Africa.If the product performs as advertised, it could bring sweeping changes to the produce industry and grocery aisles. It could reduce food waste and the use of pesticides and increase the varieties of fruits and vegetables available.But the company\u2019s product is still largely untested at a commercial level, and it faces several potential hurdles beyond effectiveness. Consumers may be wary of a new coating on fresh food, for example, and growers may decide it adds too much cost.\u201cThe socioeconomic factors are as important as these technologies themselves,\u201d said Christopher B. Watkins, a professor at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.Americans have greater access than ever to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables year-round. That abundance can come at the expense of taste, as plants are chosen for their ability to withstand time and transportation, not necessarily for their flavor. And yet an enormous amount of what\u2019s produced still rots before it can be shipped.Another effort to alter that trade-off is SmartFresh, a product developed with Professor Watkins\u2019s research that keeps apples from ripening too quickly in storage.Apeel\u2019s products, sold under the brand names Edipeel and Invisipeel, take plant materials and extract all liquids from them to produce tiny pellets. The company then uses molecules from those pellets to control the rate of water and gases that go in and out of produce, thus slowing down the rate of decay.The version of Apeel for avocados, for example, creates a barrier that effectively fools anthracnose, a fungus that exploits tiny cracks that develop in the fruit\u2019s skin when it begins to shrivel. Anthracnose extends a little leg through those cracks and into the fruit itself, creating the ugly brown spots that are such a nasty surprise when an avocado is opened.Edipeel can stave off anthracnose by up to 30 days longer than existing techniques for combating the fungus. \u201cIt basically sees a different molecule than it\u2019s used to seeing and moves on,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.Invisipeel can be applied while crops are still in the field. Edipeel can be applied after a harvest; crops can be coated while on a conveyor belt or dipped in the solution.So far, the products are derived primarily from the remains of produce that has been certified organic, like grape skins left over from wine production and stems left behind after broccoli is harvested. They can be easily washed away with water.Some big venture capital firms are now placing bets on Apeel. Andreessen Horowitz and DBL Partners recently led a round of $33 million investment in the company that was announced Tuesday. It has raised $40 million in total.Apeel has just begun sales of its products and said it was starting negotiations with produce companies that together account for some $6 billion in sales, according to a presentation made to potential investors.\u201cThere are one or two first markets to go after and demonstrate impact, but where you go from there with this company is extremely broad,\u201d Mr. Pande said.He said Apeel could, for instance, increase yields by reducing losses at the harvest level, which would translate into lower prices for consumers. It could reduce agriculture\u2019s environmental impact by allowing growers to ship products with an Edipeel barrier at higher temperatures. And before harvest, an Edipeel barrier could repel pests and fungi and thus reduce the use of pesticides.And then there is the impact on wasted food.Apeel came into being when Mr. Rogers was a doctoral student in materials science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He began to wonder whether the same processes he was studying to develop coatings that could be used to produce inexpensive plastic solar cells might also be applied to extend the life of produce.He then drafted Jenny Du, a fellow grad student who had studied the synthesis and application of inorganic nanostructured films among other things, and the two of them began working in his garage to develop Edipeel.The foundation has used the product on the cassava root, an important source of calories in the African diet and thus is grown widely by small farmers there. Cassava root also can be processed into starch for use in commercial food preparation.Once plucked from the ground, however, the roots deteriorate rapidly, making it virtually impossible for small farmers to exploit the crop commercially.\u201cIf not consumed or processed in 24 to 48 hours, you lose significant amounts,\u201d said Rob Horsch, who leads the agricultural research and development team at the Gates Foundation. \u201cThat makes it hard to generate any income from what\u2019s produced, and a lot of it goes to waste.\u201dEdipeel more than doubled the shelf life of cassava, helping the root retain starch long enough to get it to a processing plant. According to an analysis by Apeel, use of its Edipeel product will create $1 billion in the market value of cassava in Nigeria alone.\u201cFarmers who used the product during trials in Africa are now clamoring for it,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.Mr. Ruskey grows finger limes, which produce a citrus \u201ccaviar\u201d prized by chefs and bartenders. The limes, which look rather like gherkins, are good for two weeks at the most, making broad distribution almost impossible.\u201cMost people do not understand how much is applied to fruits and vegetables to keep them looking good \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of wax out there,\u201d Mr. Ruskey said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point that if you have iced tea with us, we no longer give you a lemon slice because of the wax on it.\u201dThe barrier Apeel has created for Good Land almost doubles the viability of the limes at this point, and Mr. Ruskey is now testing the application process and shelf life in the market.\u201cSo far,\u201d he said, \u201cit looks very promising.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the he proprietor of Good Land Organics. He is Jay Ruskey, not Luskey or Luckey. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a picture caption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Holiday Cheer? Look Elsewhere", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerBeing a largehearted fellow with a deep and abiding faith in humanity, the Haggler likes to take the days between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day and look back at the warmth and good cheer he encountered in this column over the past 12 months.So he did that.It took four seconds.Because when he browsed through the episodes of 2016, he found many tales of companies behaving badly. In some cases, very badly. The year was like every other in the Haggler\u2019s career of interventions on behalf of consumers. Moments of reconciliation were rare. Moments of enlightenment even rarer.Which is to say that if you\u2019re in the mood for uplift, dear readers, try a forklift. What follows is an update to some of the standout examples of shouting and agita as we once again look back at a year in haggling.The real William Swenson, who does not have a Facebook account, seemed somewhat amused by the misuse of his image and biography. His father, less so. After the Haggler helped get the attention of Facebook, the company took down a particularly stubborn \u201cWilliam Swenson\u201d account. But Swenson the elder said that for months afterward, he was battling with Facebook over other William Swenson-inspired accounts, some of which used a photograph of his son receiving the Medal of Honor from President Obama. He spent three weeks, for instance, needling Facebook to take down a Devoe Swenson William page.\u201cI have 72 pages reported and removed so far,\u201d he wrote to the Haggler in October. \u201cThere are several other clearly bogus pages, without photos, but I know I have to live with that.\u201dMr. Fox\u2019s many victims may wonder how, exactly, he will ever earn $45 million. Good question. According to reports, he said in court that he wanted to take computer classes in prison, and start a new business when he is released, then use profits from that venture to make restitution.The Haggler doesn\u2019t see what could possibly go wrong with this plan.But the nonprofit had dealt with IDC Servco in September, or at least it had dealt with a man named Jim Snodgrass, who said he was with IDC Servco. What was really going on here? In a brief phone call with the Haggler, Mr. Snodgrass said that the company\u2019s lawyer would explain. That never happened, and the mystery endures.But the Haggler learned a few days ago that he wasn\u2019t the only one scratching his head. On Dec. 19, an agent of the Secret Service, which was involved in the IDC Servco indictments, contacted the Haggler in search of contact information for the nonprofit that was overcharged by the company. This was the first time law enforcement had sought out the Haggler\u2019s help. It made the Haggler feel useful, in a novel way.If this leads to more news, the Haggler will share.Around that time, the company was unveiling an update to its Android version of Apple Music. For the next three months, the Haggler tried it out. On one level, he is pleased to report, it was an improvement. There were no more dropped or duplicated songs, for instance.But it was still buggy. By month No. 3, it was nearly always necessary to restart the Haggler\u2019s smartphone to launch Apple Music. Which gets old.In short, the streaming service may no longer be stoned. But like a lot of recovering drug users, Apple Music is not exactly reliable.Since November, the Haggler has been happily using Spotify. When you write with complaints in 2017 \u2014 and by all means, please do \u2014 it will be playing in the background.Advertisement"}
