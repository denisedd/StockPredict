Why there was no continuation to this plotline? \u2014 Nat\u00e1lia (and many many others)What about the letter Emily mentioned? Why there was no continuation to this plotline? \u2014 Nat\u00e1lia (and many many others)This question came in a lot, and it\u2019s one that there\u2019s no answer to. It\u2019s not resolved within the show at all. In \u201cSpring,\u201d Emily says in therapy that she\u2019ll never forgive Lorelai for \u201cthat heinous letter she sent on my birthday\u201d \u2014 a letter Lorelai immediately says she had nothing to do with. \u201cIt was on my bed,\u201d Emily says. \u201cI remember the envelope and the color of the ink.\u201d And Lorelai repeats that she had nothing to do with the letter.This question came in a lot, and it\u2019s one that there\u2019s no answer to.

I cannot imagine Richard doing something like that. I\u2019ve seen some people float the idea that it was Trix, Richard\u2019s mother, but that seems out of character for her. That leaves Lorelai. Oh, or a maid. Emily has been consistently dismissive and often outright abusive to the people who work for her. Of course one of her many rightfully upset employees wrote that letter.Let\u2019s mention a few things about the note that I think are significant: It was on Emily\u2019s bed, which means there\u2019s a limited number of people who could have written it.

She says she remembers the ink color. My mother could pick out my handwriting in a heartbeat. Even with their fraught relationship, surely Emily could do the same?I think this is just one of those things that got lost while putting the episodes together, like Kirk\u2019s having two different names very early on. But even though my guess is that this is just an accidental oversight, I think it speaks to some of the fundamental conflicts in their relationship, namely that each thinks the other is constantly keeping score, which each uses as an excuse for why she, herself, is keeping score. Lorelai once referred to Emily and Richard as \u201cthe two proudest people,\u201d and they are. But so is she.I think this is just one of those things that got lost while putting the episodes together, like Kirk\u2019s having two different names very early on.

Is [creator] Amy Sherman-Palladino just really #TeamLogan? Was Lorelai over trying to get her 32-year-old daughter not to make those same mistakes again? No one seemed to take any real issue with it, and that really bothered me. \u2014 ClaireI don\u2019t understand the casual nature with which Rory\u2019s affair was treated, especially given Lorelai\u2019s response to Rory\u2019s affair with Dean.

But now that I\u2019ve watched these four episodes a few times, I\u2019m increasingly convinced that even though 10 years have elapsed \u2026 they really haven\u2019t. Well, the show is claiming they have, but just about everything happening in this batch of episodes is what could or should have happened in a Sherman-Palladino-\u2013led final season. Rory\u2019s behaviors make a lot of sense for a 22-year-old. The only reason Luke and Lorelai hadn\u2019t gotten married yet was so their wedding could be the finale: That is in no way a story-first decision. And Lorelai\u2019s being so blas\u00e9 about Logan is because the memory of her and Rory\u2019s \u201che\u2019s not your Dean\u201d fight is somewhat fresher in her memory.I, too, was bothered!

If Rory had said, \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes\u201d \u2014 ha-ha, she will never say that \u2014 \u201cbut I love Logan; he\u2019s my one and only, and the best way I know how to live in this world is with him by my side,\u201d then I think the cheating stuff might have sorted itself out.

To me, it seemed like they\u2019d barely seen each other over the past nine years. I don\u2019t recall their relationship at the end of the series being so ... whatever it was in the finale. \u2014 Claire againWhat do you think is the current nature of Rory and Christopher\u2019s relationship?

That scene was extra weird visually \u2014 overly bright, and the camera sort of floating around \u2014 which contributed to the overall stiltedness of the encounter.I think they saw each other plenty initially, but in the most recent year and change, I think Rory was skulking around and not engaging fully with her world.

If you look back at the scenes where Chris hangs out with Logan at Yale and they bond (Season 6, I think?), it seems even clearer. Even for a Jess superfan, it seems like a lazy ending, and one that Rory \u2014 despite how awful she was during this Netflix series \u2014 doesn\u2019t deserve.It disappointed me to realize that Logan was brought in from the beginning to reprise Chris.

She\u2019s weaker and less headstrong. She\u2019s not someone who would leave her family\u2019s riches to go hardscrabble it with a baby. At heart, she isn\u2019t someone who would want to raise a baby alone. It goes against everything we\u2019ve ever known about her character. \u2014 HilaryI think the problem, too, with replaying history here is that Rory isn\u2019t a mini-Lorelai.

Luke is the most reliable man other than Richard on this entire show. He has been a constant presence in Lorelai\u2019s and Rory\u2019s lives, one who encouraged them and supported them (including once giving Lorelai a loan), and legit fed them just about every day.I don\u2019t mind the Christopher-Logan echoes so much, but I do not think Jess is Luke II.

(Hello.) But Luke\u2019s whole thing was his fundamental obsession with family: He turned his dad\u2019s store into a diner, and he lived there for his entire adult life.

Jess loves Luke because Luke really was there for him, not just because Luke is his uncle.I am down for Adult Jess, and I absolutely buy that many people who are snotty teens can grow into more thoughtful adults.

I feel like she did a great job with those students, and for someone who always made a huge deal about loooving school and learning, teaching seems like a no-brainer, right? To say nothing of the fact that she was GUARANTEED A JOB at a pretty damn prestigious prep school. That seems a huge step up compared to a glorified newsletter that doesn\u2019t pay its editor/can\u2019t spring for a used computer with Publisher installed. Plus, masters programs for teaching take 1 to 2 years, tops.

Personally, I thought she was such an amazing character and was really disappointed that she was only portrayed as a device to Zach and to Rory. \u2014 AdrianaWhy do you think Sherman-Palladino shrugged Lane off so badly?

They hired a guy to ride around on a unicycle to say one sentence? Did they buy fog machines? Did they buy an animatronic bird? Or was that supposed to be a real bird? Just terrible.Several of you wrote in to say that you thought it was initially a dream sequence, and I was in the same boat. They hired a guy to ride around on a unicycle to say one sentence?

If that had been a montage of Lane and Paris and Rory dorking around, I would have been fine with it. Elated, even. The original \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d was a network show, and that comes with all kinds of constraints. Watching the show spread its wings a little, trying something visually different and structurally different, doesn\u2019t seem so bad. I wish it had been less stupid, certainly, but I don\u2019t know that it broke anything for me really.But!

In the original series she always had a book with her, but you don\u2019t see her reading once in the new episodes.

Time for Children to Ring in the New Year With Fake Countdowns", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byNetflix has a trick for parents who want their children to ring in 2017 without staying up until midnight.Andy Yeatman, director of Global Kids Content for Netflix, said the videos would put parents in charge, whether that means they celebrate at 9 p.m. before the children go to bed, or stagger countdowns throughout the night.\u201cI have three young daughters, so for us, that means celebrating three times with three different countdowns they each get to choose,\u201d he said in a statement.The company said its data showed the peak viewing hour of the countdowns leading to 2016 was 8 p.m. local time in the United States.The videos, some of which last up to five minutes, can be found by searching \u201ccountdowns\u201d on Netflix. Characters featured are from shows such as \u201cWord Party,\u201d \u201cAll Hail King Julien,\u201d \u201cTrollhunters\u201d and \u201cFuller House.\u201dNetflix started the countdown in 2014 with one short, from \u201cAll Hail King Julien.\u201d That expanded to six titles in 2015.Netflix noted that some parents will do whatever it takes to get children to bed before the ball drops in Times Square. Citing research it sponsored, the company said that more than one-third of parents in the United States said they had started a party early to fool their children into thinking it was midnight or searched for a countdown in a different time zone to celebrate earlier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Could Be Practical Magic for Disney", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsWalt Disney may be looking for a bit of two-for-one magic. The $160 billion entertainment conglomerate is on the hunt for technology to connect consumers directly with its movies and television shows. It is also in need of a successor to its chief executive, Bob Iger. A Netflix acquisition including its founder, Reed Hastings, might just answer both dreams \u2014 though it would be pricey.The Magic Kingdom lost some of its zip in 2015, when Mr. Iger indicated that fewer people were paying for ESPN, its cable sports network and profit engine. Shares of Disney are off about 20 percent since then.All the same, the company has been one of the forward thinkers in its business when it comes to bypassing traditional cable boxes. ESPN is part of new packages like Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV. Mr. Iger splashed out $1 billion for a one-third stake in Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming technology, with the option to buy it out.Disney could, however, think much bigger. Netflix could provide more streaming know-how and 87 million subscribers worldwide. Mr. Hastings has defied the odds in developing his 20-year-old creation from mail-in DVDs to an online leader and content producer. He could be a candidate to replace Mr. Iger, who is slated to step down in 2018.Netflix would be expensive, though. It trades at well over 100 times next year\u2019s estimated earnings, compared with Disney\u2019s 16 times multiple. Assuming a standard 30 percent premium, the purchase would cost $65 billion. To match the $15 billion uplift from the market price in present-value terms, Mr. Iger would need to find over $2 billion in annual cost savings. That is a big chunk, but Disney could plausibly substitute a third of the content that Mr. Hastings plans to spend more than $6 billion a year on to make and buy.Netflix would still offer Disney an inadequate financial return. Sometimes, though, there is more at stake, like leapfrogging into the latest technology and securing the right leader. The House of Mouse paid nearly 50 times earnings for Pixar in 2006, but the purchase solved strategic problems and reinvigorated its animation studio.Asked recently about acquisitions including Netflix, Mr. Iger did not get specific but did not rule anything out, either. Lots could go awry with a big, bold purchase, from shareholder backlash to culture battles. Still, the storyboard is something Disney might want to sketch out.Advertisement"}

Cut to generals with furrowed brows fretting in Mandarin as the monsters come tumbling over a hill.Will their megastructure do its job?\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work, then I don\u2019t know what will,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a political-science professor at the University of Southern California who has studied China\u2019s efforts in recent years to emerge as a moviemaking superpower. \u201cThe film addresses a lot of the previous issues that China has faced as it\u2019s tried to internationalize its film industry, like language and the lack of internationally known stars.\u201d\u201cThe Great Wall\u201d passed its first test.\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say,\u201d Mr. Tull said, when asked whether he thought the film, which drew mixed reviews in China, would be profitable.The crucial test lies ahead. \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d arrives in North American multiplexes on Feb. 17. Movie executives say prospects in the United States and Canada come down to one question: Are ticket buyers ready to embrace a film that is very much Chinese, even if it does have an American star in a lead role?The People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, even weighed in on \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d this week, publishing a commentary following what it called \u201clively online criticism\u201d of the film. \u201cEven if it is successful in overseas markets, the road on which Chinese culture goes out to the world is bound to be bumpy,\u201d the article said.Mr. Zhang\u2019s extreme close-ups, pacing and use of 3-D effects that come straight at viewers are likely to stand out as a departure from Hollywood\u2019s usual cinematic language, but Ms. Jing\u2019s character may best sum up the cultural needle the movie tries to thread. Her general is at once the supreme leader (in keeping with a recent trend in Hollywood movies to depict women as every bit as tough as men) and strikingly demure when not in battle (something the filmmakers felt made her more viable to Eastern audiences).Trying to appeal to everyone often warps the result. Movie executives, citing past experiences, say that audiences leave thinking that something was off the mark, even if they aren\u2019t quite sure what.\u201cThe biggest challenge in the film was integrating the two cultures,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing this month. \u201cWe knew it would not be enough to rely on the novelty of the film\u2019s Chinese elements to attract Western audiences. So we spent a lot of energy and time working on the story.\u201d\u201cI have a feeling that Qingdao is going to be calling a lot of us back over the next few years,\u201d Mr. Damon said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible.\u201dBut does he think \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d will be a hit on his home turf?\u201cI\u2019m not really the target audience for the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun and spectacular in the true meaning of the word. But, then again, I don\u2019t know how to predict what that will mean.\u201dBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles and Amy Qin from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Hair shirt or hair of the dog?For the purpose of this column, I\u2019ll divide hangover movies into two loose categories: \u201cWhat Am I Doing With My Life?\u201d and \u201cWell, That Wasn\u2019t So Bad, Was It?\u201d We\u2019ll begin with the first group. \u201cSmash-Up: The Story of a Woman,\u201d a 1947 movie starring Susan Hayward, who played an alcoholic as such in three pictures (and an implied one in a bunch more). The movie begins with Ms. Hayward in a hospital bed, three-fourths of her head bandaged up, repeating, \u201cI need a drink.\u201d It then flashes back to how she got that way. The movie has not aged well, in spite of its authentic portrait of alcohol abuse \u2014 the script was written in part by Dorothy Parker, who struggled with the same her whole life. (\u201cI\u2019ll Cry Tomorrow,\u201d the 1955 film in which Hayward plays the singer Lillian Roth, is the best of Hayward\u2019s pictures in this category but is not available on streaming video.) \u201cSmash-Up\u201d is available free to Amazon Prime members, but it\u2019s also in the public domain, which means it\u2019s on YouTube, undisturbed (a lot of the copyrighted material users post there is taken down by the copyright holders).

{"Headline": "Reggie Watts, the Tip of Comedy\u2019s Absurdist Spear", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byIt might be the right message for the moment since, according to a quick poll of a half-dozen working stand-ups, audiences have been a bit on edge since the election, quicker to bristle and more hesitant to laugh. Mr. Holmes avoids topical material, displaying Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s gift for the amusingly phrased observation about ordinary life, but not his sarcasm or irritation. Mr. Holmes\u2019s humor is not just warm. It\u2019s anticool. After a broad pun earns groans, he says, \u201cThat is a terrible joke but it\u2019s the only one tonight you\u2019re going to remember.\u201dPreaching joy is, however, different than demonstrating it, and for comedy that does this most fully, you can do no better than \u201cSpatial\u201d (Netflix), a giddy rush of escapist nonsense from Reggie Watts, the most influential absurdist in comedy today. Like Mr. Holmes, he finds comfort in \u201cStar Wars\u201d jokes, opening his show in a Jedi cloak and intoning darkly about faraway star systems. (The title riffs on \u201cspecial\u201d as well as otherworldly interests.) Then after a blackout, he appears in the audience before crowd-surfing to the stage. After lowering the microphone, preposterously set up for a giant, Mr. Watts says with great moment: \u201cWelcome to the here it is.\u201dThis may sound like an awkward line, but this introduction to an introduction is a precise encapsulation of his self-satirizing and fluid aesthetic, drawing attention to its own artifice, perpetually shifting gears and blurring the lines between setup and punch line. But it\u2019s also a joke on how stubbornly he resists categorization. What kind of weird comedy is this? His answer: Here it is.With its cheesy theme song and laugh track, \u201cCrowe\u2019s Nest\u201d satirizes 1970s television (\u201cImprovised in front of a live studio audience\u201d), but this comedy isn\u2019t so much mocking the world as creating its own. This is a show that never stays still, a deliberate mess that shifts moods and genres, tossing together tap dancing, beatboxing and multiple costume changes with the anything-goes spirit of vaudeville.Mr. Watts also tells jokes, but they aren\u2019t exactly traditional, either. They don\u2019t build so much as gradually unravel. With Ms. Berlant and Mr. Scovel he shares a conviction that the biggest \u2014 or maybe just the best \u2014 laughs are on the trip to the punch line. Mr. Watts is always telling you what he is about to do or what his show is or is not. He sets up elaborate promises that go forgotten and builds tangents upon tangents, spiraling into circular logic. \u201cGuns are like guns,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more that you use them, the more they get used.\u201d He delights in the comedy of language (wordplay, repurposed clich\u00e9s), finding laughs in mangled jargon that is only slightly off: \u201cHow many people here enjoyed their air flights?\u201dMr. Watts can seem more delighted by words than ideas, and yet he might be most tickled by sounds. During his show he clicks his tongue, speeds up a story so it\u2019s incomprehensible, adopts multiple accents. Sometimes these shifts serve a joke or a satiric point. But just as often, Mr. Watts aims for the pure childish pleasure of gibberish.He is mocking self-importance when he discusses the gravity of having a \u201cplatform,\u201d sending up comics with a message. Boasting about a three-city tour, he\u2019s poking fun at both himself and the pervasive self-promotion of an era when everyone is a brand. \u201cWe\u2019re selling out small to medium-sized rooms,\u201d he trumpets. \u201cKevin Hart, he can\u2019t do that,\u201d he adds, pausing before the critical final word, \u201ccomfortably.\u201dBut to the extent that Mr. Watts is making fun of anything, he\u2019s doing it gently. For an artist with experimental tendencies, he isn\u2019t aiming to confront or tear anything down. His mood is welcoming, just messing around, without an ounce of anxiety. It\u2019s infectious. At the end, he dresses up as Don Cornelius from \u201cSoul Train,\u201d a disco ball appears and his audience dances.Generally, comics try to end their set with surefire jokes that will get big laughs, but as anyone who has seen a musical knows, to reach a certain emotional peak, sometimes you need to move into song. For a comic to do so, however, means the goal is something other than just laughter. In these rousing finales, performers skip past funny and head right toward happy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secular Hollywood Quietly Courts the Faithful", "Date": "2016-12-24", "News": "Supported byThe Rev. Roderick Dwayne Belin, a senior A.M.E. Church leader, stood before a gathering of more than 1,000 pastors in a drafty Marriott ballroom in Naperville, Ill., this month and extolled the virtues of a Hollywood movie.\u201cImagine this clip playing to your congregation, perhaps tied to a theological discussion about our sacred lives and our secular lives and how there is really no division,\u201d he said, before showing the trailer for \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d which 20th Century Fox will release in theaters nationwide on Jan. 6.\u201cI came away really interested in using film to explore faith,\u201d Mr. Belin said.The marketers are writing bullet points for sermons, providing footage for television screens mounted in sanctuaries and proposing Sunday school lesson plans. In some cases, studios are even flying actors, costume designers and producers to megachurch discussion groups.Hollywood\u2019s awareness of its need to pay better attention to flyover-state audiences has grown even more urgent of late, as ultraliberal movie executives, shocked to see a celebrity-encircled Hillary Clinton lose the presidential election to Donald J. Trump, have realized the degree to which they are out of touch with a vast pool of Americans. Tens of millions of voters did not care what stars had to say in support of Mrs. Clinton.Studios used to sell movies by bombarding television networks with advertising on the eve of release. That tactic is still used for summer blockbusters, but it is expensive and increasingly ineffective in the DVR age. As a result, studios are aggressively trying to plumb niche markets that can be reached through word of mouth.In the coming weeks, Mr. Bryant plans to bring up to 300 parishioners to a Wit PR-organized screening of \u201cHidden Figures\u201d in Northwest Baltimore. Afterward, Mr. Bryant intends to lead a discussion connecting the plot to a theological message.\u201cMost studios, to be honest, have no idea how to market to us,\u201d Mr. Bryant said. \u201cThey\u2019re still doing the Sammy Davis Jr. tap dance: \u2018Look at me! Aren\u2019t you impressed?\u2019 Well, no, not really. But if you bring us into the tent, we are often excited to spread the word.\u201dWhat is new is the aggression and sophistication.At the same time, consultants are refining their efforts. Kevin Goetz, the chief executive of the movie research company Screen Engine/ASI, recently initiated a proprietary Faith Tracker that monitors moviegoing in a sample of 800 people \u2014 evangelical, traditional Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon and those whom he calls \u201cspiritual but not necessarily religious.\u201d It\u2019s a tool designed to help studios understand whether their faith-based advertising and publicity efforts are connecting with the target audience before a film\u2019s release.An even bolder Screen Engine/ASI initiative involves a 1,000-member \u201cinfluencer\u201d service made up of movie-attuned pastors. Some of those will be invited to view unfinished films online, to offer feedback that may help filmmakers shape them and marketers sell them.And film studios, desperate to assemble large crowds on opening weekends, have newly realized that religious Americans, if approached on their own terms, can be captured for movies that would, at first glance, seem to be an unusual fit.\u201cIf you feel comfortable doing so, discuss the times in your life where you have felt abandoned by God,\u201d suggests the guide, alongside a photo of the film\u2019s star, Brie Larson.With the exception of crude comedies, the majority of studio offerings \u2014 even certain R-rated horror movies \u2014 have qualities that can resonate with faith audiences, Mr. Pons said. But the merits have to be called out. Otherwise, Christian audiences may take one look at mainstream marketing materials and decide that a film is not for them.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing watching people in Hollywood discover there is interest in their content they never knew existed,\u201d Mr. Pons said. \u201cOn the faith side, some people are surprised to learn that, hey, there is good content coming from studios. Hollywood isn\u2019t always the enemy.\u201dThe increasing number of consultants arriving in Hollywood to help forestall such problems \u2014 for fees starting at about $300,000 per film and going up to $3 million \u2014 is also leading to gridlock at church offices. Some megachurch pastors, for instance, complain that they are being inundated with film-related requests.Undoubtedly aware of that perception, studios try to keep a tight lid on their efforts, sometimes even insisting that no faith outreach is happening on behalf of a film, when there is actually a coordinated effort. Studios live in equal fear that obvious appeals to religious audiences will alienate more secular ticket buyers. Almost all studio executives contacted for this article rejected repeated interview requests, citing policies not to publicly discuss marketing strategies of any kind.For decades, religious audiences had little tolerance for many of the movies produced by Hollywood. By the 1990s, when films like Quentin Tarantino\u2019s violent \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d entered the mainstream, the culture gap seemed unbridgeable.The $29 million film took off at the box office (ultimately selling $309 million in tickets). Mr. Bock and Grace Hill circulated film clips and sermon outlines to 22,000 pastors, some of whom preached its story of personal determination and racial conciliation. One suggested \u201csermon starter\u201d involved a scene where the lead character, played by Sandra Bullock, abruptly persuades her husband to stop their car and offer a young man a ride.\u201cHas God ever nudged your heart?\u201d the notes read.\u201cPeople are sometimes surprised to find me, a conservative Christian guy, working in Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Peluso said. \u201cThere are a lot of us, actually. More than people think.\u201d\u201cHidden Figures,\u201d produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, has been marketed with all of the usual Hollywood bells and whistles.So why also employ Wit?Elizabeth Gabler, the president of Fox 2000, the studio division behind \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d said in a statement, \u201cCorby and Marshall help to locate these important faith audiences and leaders who are hungry for aspirational content without feeling like they are going to church.\u201dMr. Mitchell, 46, and Mr. Pons, 39, went to work early last year, reading the \u201cHidden Figures\u201d script, written by Theodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder (and based on Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s book). They decided that this film, because it was not overtly religious, needed to be \u201cpoured with Dixie cups instead of buckets,\u201d as Mr. Pons put it. Translation: Spread the word by facilitating discussion rather than hammering home a message through blanket ads in Christian publications.\u201cWe see this as a healing movie,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cAt a moment when so many people \u2014 right and left, black and white \u2014 are arguing over what America is or what America isn\u2019t, here is a chance to come together in a theater and look up, to space quite literally in this case, but metaphorically too.\u201dIn 2008, along with a third friend, they formed a publicity company called Different Drummer. Mr. Pons and Mr. Mitchell split from that firm in 2014 and founded Wit PR, picking a name that is meant to convey smarts but also stands for \u201cwhatever it takes.\u201dThat kind of gumption was recently on display on a Wit PR conference call. The principals were going through a list of \u201cactivations\u201d planned for \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d Mr. Mitchell announced that he had just arranged with two Christian sororities to bring students and alumnae together for \u201cHidden Figures\u201d screenings and discussions on opening weekend.\u201cThrough those faith relationships, we\u2019re going to end up selling at least 1,000 tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cDelivering a measurable result like that is the goal.\u201dMichael Cieply contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Travelers,\u2019 Some Serious Time-Sharing", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byProposed slogan for a substantial chunk of television in 2016: \u201cBetter Living Through Time Travel.\u201d Everywhere you looked last year, characters were jumping about in time, generally hoping to improve their own lot or the world\u2019s, and generally failing.Centuries in the future, someone figures out how to send human consciousness back in time and insert it into a host body at the moment of the host\u2019s death. Why would future us want to do this? Because apparently life a few hundred years out is unpleasant, and the race is struggling to survive, something that isn\u2019t described in detail so much as implied by small moments \u2014 the time travelers savor certain foods, for instance, as if they had never tasted them before.The travelers hope to alter events in our time to improve things in theirs, though the application of this philosophy is maddeningly inconsistent, which is a logical problem with a lot of time-travel yarns. But never mind that; the intriguing part of \u201cTravelers\u201d is that the newcomers, thanks to an imperfect vetting process, sometimes land in problematic hosts. Philip (Reilly Dolman) finds himself in a heroin addict\u2019s body. Marcy (MacKenzie Porter) takes up residence in the body of a woman with intellectual disabilities, and, boy, is her social worker surprised when his barely verbal charge is suddenly more articulate than he is.Some travelers\u2019 issues are less consuming but still vexing. Grant (Eric McCormack) assumes the body of an F.B.I. agent whose wife wouldn\u2019t mind a little romance now and then. Trevor (Jared Abrahamson) is a high school athlete who, in between world-saving missions, has to worry about his grades. And Carly (Nesta Cooper) has a baby.This group, which receives instructions from the future, is only one of many teams that have been sent back. The fun of the series is watching the five try to blend into the pre-existing lives they have inherited without raising suspicions. It\u2019s the little things that matter. Grant\u2019s wife (Leah Cairns) wonders why he\u2019s suddenly calling her Kathryn rather than the familiar Kat. Trevor no longer knows how to throw a football.The show, created by Brad Wright, is enjoyable science fiction if you can ignore the contradictions (why is it fine to change the future of the human race but not to save a boy about to be killed by kidnappers?) \u2014 and if you haven\u2019t already had enough time-traveling.If this were a Ph.D. thesis, I would now try to make the case that this glut of time-travel shows reflects the cultural moment, that it is a manifestation of our desire to flee to a more trouble-free time, or to solve intractable present-day problems, not through hard work, but by making a small tweak in the past. The reality, though, is more mundane. There are a lot of time-travel shows because there are a lot of small-screen outlets desperate for content, and the time-travel premise is remarkably versatile.You can use it to fashion a high-concept science-fiction series like \u201cTravelers\u201d or \u201c12 Monkeys,\u201d one that bends the minds of both its characters and its viewers. You can use it to create a fantasy romance like \u201cOutlander\u201d or a historical adventure show like \u201cTimeless.\u201d Comedy seem underrepresented? Fox has a time-travel show, \u201cMaking History,\u201d on the way.Anyway, this particular spate invites us to contemplate the year that has just concluded. Who among us couldn\u2019t put together a \u201cTop Five Occurrences of 2016 I\u2019d Like to Undo\u201d list? Yeah, it\u2019s fun to dream of what might have been or of what we wish hadn\u2019t been. When you perfect your own time machine, though, just remember what TV teaches us. It\u2019s almost always true that the more the characters on these shows try to alter events, the more mucked up things become.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Personality Politics of \u2018The Crown\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byEditorial NotebookThe show keeps its touch light by having political issues and the running of government take back seats to personality. It charts both the early career of Elizabeth, who took the throne in 1952 at the age of 25, and the late career of Winston Churchill, who stepped down as prime minister in 1955 at the age of 80. John Lithgow\u2019s Churchill is fragile but wily, manipulating queen and country to hold onto power even as his health fails him. His deputy, Anthony Eden (Jeremy Northam), wants to depose him, but Eden has health troubles, too \u2014 one particularly heated argument between the two men ends with the deputy brandishing a \u201cclean bill of health,\u201d something I, at least, had never seen in physical form.As debate rages over which statesman is more sickly, the viewer could be forgiven for thinking the most important issue facing Britain in the 1950s was the cardiovascular fitness of its leaders. A brief mention of inflation is one of the few hints that Churchill had policies, as well as ailments. The Labour Party, which opposed Churchill\u2019s Conservatives, is visible only briefly, notably during an abortive scheme to make the prime minister look bad when a toxic fog envelops the city.But perhaps the best example of the show\u2019s odd treatment of politics comes during Elizabeth\u2019s 1952 trip to Kenya, during which she learns that her father has died and she has become queen. Before that, Elizabeth and Philip greet a receiving line of Kenyan dignitaries, including a man wearing an elaborate headpiece.\u201cLike the hat,\u201d says Philip.Elizabeth corrects him: \u201cIt\u2019s a crown.\u201dThe moment casts Elizabeth as the hero, as she rejects her husband\u2019s belittling remark and grants a fellow ruler the recognition he deserves. Of course, Elizabeth was in Kenya representing a colonial power that had used Kenyan troops in World War II but that granted huge areas of Kenyan land to British settlers. The bloody Mau Mau Rebellion was in part a response to British land policy; it began the same year Elizabeth visited Kenya.The show includes only a passing mention of African independence movements and presents Elizabeth\u2019s visit to Kenya as a triumph \u2014 a monarch charming her far-flung subjects. When Elizabeth\u2019s plane takes off for England, we see a Kenyan boy gazing skyward in admiration.\u201cThe Crown\u201d spins a fantasy in which all that matters in ruling is personal strength, tactical skill and charisma. This fantasy is not so different from the one Donald Trump has created around himself \u2014 that his celebrityhood and personality are all that\u2019s needed to fix any problem. His \u201cthank you\u201d tour of swing states is as staged \u2014 and as substance-free \u2014 as any royal appearance, though he lacks Elizabeth\u2019s regard for decorum.I\u2019ll happily watch Season 2 of \u201cThe Crown\u201d for the acting and the outfits, but I no longer see the show as a blissful escape from the present. Instead, I\u2019ll watch it as commentary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best TV Shows of 2016", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byYear-end lists are stories: They tell the truth by lying. The idea that a critic can watch all the television there is today, let alone isolate the 10 best works among wildly different genres, is a fiction. But play along with it, and you tell a larger tale about what mattered that year and why.What remains is a sampler of TV as dizzying and agitated as the year we\u2019ve just lived through. We live in interesting times, and we also get to watch them. \u2014 JAMES PONIEWOZIKNot that long ago, making a list of the best international shows on American television would have been as easy, and pointless, as reprinting the PBS \u201cMasterpiece\u201d schedule. That handful of British imports was essentially the only foreign programming available.But like everything else in TV, that\u2019s changed. My initial list for this first international Top 10 contained more than 80 shows, and that was a small slice of the foreign series available on TV or streaming services in 2016.A few notes. Five of the 11 shows on the list are British comedies. That might seem excessive, but it reflects my feeling that some of the best, most imaginative work in the world is being done in that place and genre. (Also the most energetic. American sitcoms are at a peak, too, but the best ones tend to have a muted, distressed energy \u2014 the sheer vitality of the Britcoms can be a welcome relief.)There\u2019s also an overall Anglo- and Eurocentrism to the list. That\u2019s partly because American programmers still overwhelmingly favor English-language shows, though streaming services do make a wealth of non-Western series available. So why no Korean or Chinese dramas, for instance? Because as attractive as some of them are, I still can\u2019t reconcile myself to the saccharine and melodramatic formulas that seem to be mandatory in their original markets.Finally, five of the 11 entries were first shown in the United States by Netflix. Whether it\u2019s a matter of taste or of aggressiveness and large acquisition budgets, no one matches Netflix in the breadth and quality of its international offerings, beginning with my No. 1 show. \u2014 MIKE HALEWho has benefited most from the explosion of television offerings in the last decade or so? I would argue that it has been people whose tastes in humor run toward the bizarre, the scathing and the incongruous. Television had long decades when \u201cout there\u201d meant \u201cMy Mother the Car\u201d or \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In.\u201d Eventually shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d began pushing matters of taste, and now, with entire channels and streaming services devoted to outlandish comedy, there are shows unpredictable enough, scalding enough or ribald enough for almost any skewed funny bone. Of the new ones that turned up in 2016, here are my favorite 10. \u2014 NEIL GENZLINGERMore highlights from the year, as chosen by our critics:Advertisement"}

She made her way through a maze of tall men in tailored sweatsuits rehearsing beneath a basket, to a spot that signified a turning point in her life.\u201cI was standing right here back in 2009 when I interviewed Estelle,\u201d she said, referring to the British singer and songwriter, shortly before the start of a New York Knicks basketball game last week. \u201cI was so nervous that day because she was such a big celebrity, and I was just a 15-year-old kid in the program.\u201dMs. Benjamin \u2014 now a 22-year-old senior at Brooklyn College majoring in film production who hopes, she said, \u201cto become the next influential film director\u201d \u2014 was referring to her days as a student in the MSG Classroom program, which teaches children about jobs in television, including announcing, producing, directing and creating graphics.The academy worked with the Garden of Dreams Foundation, a nonprofit that helps children facing obstacles, to form the MSG Classroom program, which allows students to use Madison Square Garden as a laboratory of sorts. Program members are free to interview MSG employees and officials; players with the Knicks, the New York Rangers and the New York Liberty; and celebrity guests booked by MSG Entertainment.\u201cThat experience is what motivated me to want to become the next Martin Scorsese, the next Quentin Tarantino, the next Spike Lee,\u201d Ms. Benjamin said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t nearly as many female directors out there, so I would love to break through and contribute my own artistic vision to the industry. And if that means directing a drama or a horror flick or a cheesy romantic comedy, it really doesn\u2019t matter. I just want the opportunity to put my own creative stamp on something.\u201dHaving long recognized Ms. Benjamin\u2019s desire to become a director, program officials gave her the chance to meet Mr. Lee, an avid Knicks fan. His directorial skills, Ms. Benjamin said, \u201cchanged the film game in a lot of ways.\u201dThe meeting took place during halftime at the Knicks game against the Oklahoma City Thunder last Monday, when Ms. Benjamin was escorted to a section of courtside seats where she found Mr. Lee chatting with the comedian Chris Rock. Mr. Lee immediately invited Ms. Benjamin over, and wasted no time offering her valuable advice.\u201cThe easiest way to break into this business is to be a writer-director, with a hyphen,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are your writing skills?

Just keep writing.\u201dMr. Lee became animated when Ms. Benjamin said to him, \u201cWhen you came along, you did a lot of things that were new at the time, and now it sometimes feels as if everything has already been done.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole new world of cinema yet to be discovered, and we need more female directors like yourself out there trying to find it. So keep believing in yourself and do not let anyone discourage you from telling a story you want to tell. That\u2019s just noise that you don\u2019t want to hear.\u201dMr. Lee offered one more directorial tip. \u201cAlways remember that a good director needs to be surrounded by very good actors, because the best actors might bring something extra or new to a role that you never expected,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that out one day when you\u2019re directing Denzel.\u201dWhen their conversation ended, Mr. Lee invited Ms. Benjamin to spend a day on the set of his coming Netflix show, \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d named for Mr. Lee\u2019s first movie, released in 1986. The series is being filmed in Brooklyn.\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Ms. Benjamin said, her smile widening. \u201cThat would be amazing.\u201dAndrea Greenberg, president and chief executive of the television company MSG Networks, which runs the program, and a board member of the Garden of Dreams Foundation, said that Ms. Benjamin was \u201cjust one example of the long-lasting impact and effect the foundation has on our kids, which is something we pride ourselves on \u2014 and we are very proud of Jazmyn.\u201dSo is Ms. Benjamin\u2019s mother, Monica, who watched as Mr. Lee held court with her daughter.\u201cWhat an amazing night,\u201d said the elder Ms. Benjamin, who now lives with her three children in an apartment of their own in West Harlem.\u201cJazmyn is a very artistic person who has impressed me with a few film projects she has directed at school,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s always looking for that different camera angle, always trying new and creative things, and in that regard, she\u2019s a lot like Spike.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Groundbreaking Horror Movies You Won\u2019t See in a Theater", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byStreamingMr. Flanagan is, like Mr. King, eclectic in his range: He can do supernatural and non-supernatural horror with equal conviction. His movies contain violence, sometimes of the grisly kind, but he doesn\u2019t go for the constant semiautomatic, conviction-free sadism that distinguishes the \u201cSaw\u201d franchise and other movies. He also doesn\u2019t go for the arguably cheap \u201cjump scares\u201d that are a feature of many contemporary horror pictures.But it won\u2019t do to call him old-fashioned. He\u2019s doing new things. The parallel editing of \u201cOculus,\u201d portraying his characters as young children and young adults in shifting flashbacks and flash-forwards that become increasingly complex as the movie progresses, is innovative. In \u201cHush,\u201d the way he uses movie language to change perspectives \u2014 from the deaf heroine to the hearing outside world \u2014 is similarly inventive. (\u201cHush\u201d was written by Mr. Flanagan and his lead actress, Kate Siegel, who were married this year.)While he worked with celluloid only briefly while studying film at Towson University in Maryland, Mr. Flanagan said in a phone interview that whatever platform they\u2019re going to be viewed on, he wanted his movies to feel like \u2026 movies. \u201cWith digital technology there\u2019s a huge spectrum of flexibility in what you can do to manipulate sound and image,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich you can push into a really artificial realm if you aren\u2019t careful.\u201dMr. Flanagan, who is in his mid-30s, mentioned \u201cJaws\u201d as a picture that showed him \u201cwhat cinema can do\u201d and also cited horror classics like \u201cThe Changeling,\u201d \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Shining\u201d as influences. He said the 1940s movies of the producer Val Lewton (\u201cCat People\u201d) gave him an appreciation of atmosphere.\u201cA movie studio has to answer to a marketing department, and to shareholders, to ensure the broadest audience possible for its product; it tends to err on the side of caution as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cNetflix has an incredible bravery about things that just don\u2019t excite a studio anymore. You can feel the excitement they have about just getting a project into production.\u201c\u2018Gerald\u2019s Game,\u2019 we could not have made it at a studio without substantive changes to the story. Working in this way takes away a lot of the red tape that you\u2019d have to machete your way through in the studio system.\u201dIs there any downside? \u201cThe question is how long that attitude can survive the bigger the company becomes, but I haven\u2019t seen any signs of it flagging,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. Netflix will probably release \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d in the spring. Mr. Flanagan said the service may want to give it some festival exposure before offering it to subscribers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After a Cyberattack, Germany Fears Election Disruption", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 After hackers infiltrated the German Parliament\u2019s computer network in May 2015, it took nearly a year before the country\u2019s intelligence agency concluded that the attack was most likely the work of their Russian counterparts.Berlin is now concerned that Germany will become the next focus of Moscow\u2019s campaign to destabilize Western democracies as national elections approach next year.Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, warned in an interview on Thursday of \u201cgrowing evidence for attempts to influence the federal election next year.\u201dHis agency has seen an increase in \u201caggressive cyberespionage\u201d targeting German politicians, he said.If the advent of the personal computer helped undermine a closed Soviet system that could not compete in an information age, then exploiting the vulnerabilities of the internet and social media may be Russia\u2019s revenge.The aim, they say, is to undercut liberal opponents of Moscow, destabilize political systems and undermine democratic processes across the European Union and in NATO member countries, while supporting anti-European forces.\u201cBased on the prevailing Russian strategy of hybrid influence and destabilization, which we have observed over time and for which we have facts, the government, officials and some political parties have become sensitized to this form of conflict,\u201d said Wilfried Jilge, an expert on Ukraine and Eastern Europe with the German Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cSuch suspicions are the result of observation and experience over the past year and a half,\u201d Mr. Jilge said.Many of the efforts seem intended to tilt elections in a direction preferred by Moscow or to undercut certain leaders.That was presumably the motivation for hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton, who long had an antagonistic relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.On the other hand, her challenger, the eventual winner, Donald J. Trump, was effusive in his praise for the Russian leader.Germans have not been immune to such disinformation, either.In January, a news article that said a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had been kidnapped and raped by migrants in Germany spread quickly on Russian-language news channels.Outrage over a supposed cover-up of the abuse drew members of Germany\u2019s Russian-speaking minority into the streets across the country, shocking German politicians.German police officials later proved that the events never took place. But the damage was already done, and the false report fed opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to open the doors to nearly a million refugees.As for Moscow\u2019s motivations in Germany, Eberhard Schneider, a professor of political science at the University of Siegen, has observed Russia\u2019s propaganda tactics since the days of the Cold War.Ms. Merkel, he noted, was one of the strongest supporters of the sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Putin has a strong incentive to undermine her.\u201cGermany is the most important power in the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can harm Germany and prevent that Merkel has a good outcome in the next election, that is in his interest.\u201dThe disruption at Deutsche Telekom, which began on Nov. 27, set off a fresh round of alarm over potential Russian meddling and the vulnerability of Germany\u2019s computer networks, which could be disrupted or hacked during an election.A day after the breach, Bruno Kahl, head of the Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, raised the prospect of evidence linking Russia to interference in the United States election campaign and warned that Germany could be next.\u201cIt is known that cyberattacks take place which have no other purpose than to provoke political uncertainty,\u201d he told the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\u201cThese attempts to interfere focus on Europe, and on Germany especially,\u201d Mr. Kahl said. \u201cA kind of pressure is being exercised on public discourse and democracy here, which is unacceptable.\u201dInvestigations into the incident later blamed links to \u201ccriminal organizations,\u201d though neither Deutsche Telekom nor the government disclosed any concrete link to Moscow.Observers like Mr. Jilge of the Council on Foreign Relations say that caution is prudent in assigning blame, but that suspicion of Moscow is warranted given the accumulating pattern.\u201cThe fact that hackers appeared to have carried out this attack does not automatically mean that they are linked to Russia,\u201d he said of the Deutsche Telekom attack.\u201cBut if we look at the target and the timing, and know that such influence and disinformation is part of the Russian approach, then it is not surprising that some would seek to address this issue,\u201d he said.Asked about the Deutsche Telekom disruption, Ms. Merkel said she did not know who was responsible, but she also mentioned Russia.\u201cI will simply say, such cyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. We must inform people a lot on this point,\u201d the chancellor told reporters last week.\u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be unsettled by this,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cWe must simply know that this exists and learn to live with it.\u201dMirai was the same malware used in an attack in the United States in October that brought down websites for Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, SoundCloud and The New York Times, among others.In Germany, the malware apparently succeeded only in knocking out the routers and disrupting internet connections.\u201cAccording to our analysis, the objective of the attack is to install malware on the routers to add them to a botnet \u2014 meaning they could be used as the remote-controlled infrastructure for future attacks,\u201d Deutsche Telekom later said in a statement.The company pledged to focus on improving its network security to render it better able to resist any form of attack.The speed with which officials began to suspect Russia was a stark contrast to 2015, when hackers used a phishing tactic, using a fake email, to penetrate computers in Germany\u2019s lower house of Parliament.Only this past May did Mr. Maassen\u2019s domestic intelligence agency confirm suspicions that Russian intelligence was behind the attack. Finally, in October, it issued a broad warning.\u201cGerman parties or politicians,\u201d it cautioned, \u201ccould fall into the focus of Russian cyberespionage campaigns and operations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This was the moment he had been waiting for.\u201cI feel very proud and excited to see him onstage tonight, and so do all the fans,\u201d Mr. Cheng, a 21-year-old student who makes fan videos for a Chinese audience, said before the match. He pointed at the screen of his smartphone to indicate the thousands of people watching him on his live broadcast. \u201cWe are very, very excited.\u201dWrestling\u2019s answer is to go local \u2014 and digital. Bypassing state-controlled broadcast television, it has teamed with a video-streaming company to reach fans though computers and mobile devices.It has also geared up efforts to introduce a new audience to the suplex, the body slam and the drop-kick. W.W.E. has hired four full-time social media directors in Shanghai to maintain local-language social media accounts for its wrestlers and executives. It is also hosting viewing parties, like one this month in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, in which locals devoured pizza and cream sodas while watching a pay-per-view wrestling match and playing the W.W.E.\u2019s latest Xbox video game.\u201cSports has historically been underdeveloped in China and online, and a lot of players are looking for ways to monetize that,\u201d said Vivek Couto, a founder and a director at Media Partners Asia, an industry research consultant.Professional wrestling could use the eyeballs. Like other media companies, W.W.E. is grappling with the new world of cord-cutting, in which viewers drop their cable subscriptions and order shows, \u00e0 la carte, via the internet.International viewers offer one potential growth area. They make up only about a quarter of the paid subscribers on W.W.E.\u2019s digital subscription service, which is one of the biggest contributors to the company\u2019s bottom line.As China shows, international growth isn\u2019t always easy. In October, W.W.E. told investors it was still waiting to offer subscriptions directly to Chinese viewers.For now it works with a Chinese video company service called PPTV, which streams the company\u2019s weekly flagship shows, called \u201cSmackDown\u201d and \u201cRAW,\u201d with real-time Mandarin commentary. (Suplex, in case you were wondering, translates as deshi beishuai, or \u201cGerman-style back throw.\u201d) PPTV subscriptions start at less than $3 per month, roughly a third of what W.W.E.\u2019s own subscription service costs outside China, and include movies and other shows.Mr. Wang, a 22-year-old native of eastern Anhui Province, was an athlete after middle school, a member of the provincial rowing team. He later moved to Shanghai and took up sparring, and caught the attention of representatives from Inoki Genome Federation, a big Japanese wrestling and mixed martial arts promotion.Mr. Wang spent three years in Japan before he was noticed by W.W.E. He signed a three-year development deal with the American company and started training in Orlando over the summer in preparation for his China debut.When the moment finally arrived in Shanghai in September, Mr. Wang entered the arena to modern Chinese music. He gave the crowd a traditional Chinese, kung fu-style greeting, pressing his right fist into his left palm.In an interview, Mr. Wang said he wasn\u2019t a big believer in appealing to such nationalistic tropes.\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t see you for your nationality or ethnic group,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s less about that and more about what you can do, personally, as a warrior and a figure in the ring.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

It previously pulled \u201cLilyhammer\u201d and \u201cHemlock Grove,\u201d and announced in September that \u201cBloodline\u2019\u2019 would not be returning. Those shows, however, lasted three seasons; \u201cMarco Polo\u201d will not.In a statement, Mr. Weinstein said: \u201cNetflix has been incredible to give us the room to make a series with a cast true to every principle of diversity. It\u2019s a bold network that allows you to do that and support us in the way that Netflix did.\u201dIn the four years that Netflix has been streaming original shows, the service has been in a historic buildup mode that has it outspending every competitor, including HBO and Amazon. Netflix said in October it would spend $6 billion on content in 2017, much of it on original programming.When Netflix landed shows like the Aziz Ansari comedy \u201cMaster of None\u201d and the period drama \u201cThe Crown,\u201d FX\u2019s chief executive John Landgraf said that the streaming service overwhelmed them with \u201cshock and awe levels of money and commitment\u201d for both projects.But the \u201cMarco Polo\u201d cancellation may be a sign that Netflix will become more selective about endlessly devoting resources to original series. The streaming service has not committed to a second season for its pricey show \u201cThe Get Down\u201d (the second half of its first season will debut next year). And it\u2019s unclear how projects like the Chelsea Handler talk show are doing.The streaming service said that it does not disclose ratings because it works on a subscription model, and does not sell advertising to adults under the age of 50, as most TV networks do.Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said earlier this year that \u201cif we were spending a lot of money on shows that people weren\u2019t watching\u201d then subscribers would drop the service.The service has more than 86 million subscribers worldwide.Advertisement"}

I work hard at my job and on my personal relationships. But lately I can\u2019t help noticing how one-sided they all are. My friends and boyfriend sit back and talk about themselves nonstop without ever asking me a question about my life. It\u2019s even fallen on me to initiate plans and make all the arrangements. How should I complain to these people (or back away from them)?LISA, NEW YORKI have never worked the land, but growing up in Vermont gives me a free pass, I believe, to use farming metaphors: The best way to figure out what crop we\u2019re growing is to check our wheelbarrow at harvest time. A bushel of turnips doesn\u2019t just materialize. We cultivate them, like your relationships. I don\u2019t believe that all of your friends (and boyfriend) suddenly morphed into selfish monsters. I bet they didn\u2019t start that way, either. Let\u2019s consider the main thing they have in common: you!Selfish people abound. But it seems more plausible to me that, like many of us, you aren\u2019t comfortable with floodlights of attention. So you deflect. \u201cHow are things going at work?\u201d your pals asked. To which you replied, \u201cFine\u201d (whether they were or not) then quickly turned the attention back to them: \u201cHow about you?\u201d Over time, this redirecting can become habit. And from there, it\u2019s a short hop to making all the dinner reservations.Rather than ditching all your friends or reading them the riot act, claim some limelight for yourself, even if it\u2019s a little uncomfortable. (And it may be more than a little uncomfortable, at first, if you\u2019ve shied away from it before). Push yourself to tell your friends about challenges at work or troubles with your sister, whether they ask or not. You don\u2019t need an engraved invitation to take the mike. Simply start talking. If things aren\u2019t better after six weeks on the take-charge diet, get back in touch, O.K.?My husband and I were recently married. We didn\u2019t live together beforehand. So I am slightly stunned to learn that he has a 10-minute phone conversation with his mother every day. It\u2019s usually after breakfast, before we leave for work, but not always. Do you find this as strange as I do?HEATHERI live alone in a small apartment building. Last night at 11, there was a loud knock on my door. My upstairs neighbor, whom I had not met, was upset that my TV was too noisy. It was unintentional. But he was angrier than I would have expected, and confrontational: He didn\u2019t introduce himself and huffed off. Obviously, I\u2019ll keep the volume down. But I am uncomfortable with our interaction. I want to be a good neighbor and don\u2019t understand why he was so upset about something so minor. Should I write a note, mention this to my super, or leave it alone?ANNEIf your proposed note would include quibbling with your neighbor over the reasonableness of his anger, I would skip it. The same goes for mentioning the episode to your super, unless you felt physically threatened by the interaction. (It\u2019s hard to tell from your email, and I want you safe.)Being a good neighbor sometimes entails smoothing ruffled feathers. So, while leaving this alone (and keeping the volume down) works fine, I love your idea of a note: \u201cSorry we got off on the wrong foot.\u201d It paves the way for more pleasant meetings in the lobby.I am a dog walker. I often use my dog-walking time to catch up with friends on the phone. The problem occurs when other friends see me and want to chat, not noticing that I am on the phone (and using an earpiece). They start conversations and I become confused. Do I drop the person on the phone or the passer-by?MARIANEAs a dog owner, I vote for your paying more attention to the dogs, which you are being paid to exercise. It is safer for them, you and other pedestrians. But should you run into a pal (in person) while speaking (on the phone), simply smile and point to your earbuds as you say: \u201cI\u2019m on the phone. Let\u2019s catch up later.\u201d And remember, not even a gold-plated cellular plan lets you evade poop-scooping.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.

{"Headline": "Year of Upheaval for Restaurants That Ended Tipping", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe decided to add a tentacle,\u201d an owner, Nate Adler, said. The extra limb costs about a dollar, but the more substantial dish eased the sting of the $5 price increase.\u201cUltimately it\u2019s not about the numbers on the check, but about whether the balance and the value feels right to people as they leave the restaurant,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an entirely rational system.\u201dInstead of expecting customers to tip the people who wait on them, tip-free restaurants pay all employees wages that reflect their skill and seniority. The customer pays a fixed amount, stated in writing (in menu prices), as in virtually every other kind of consumer business, from Nordstrom to Netflix to The New York Times.It is too soon to tell whether the no-tipping model will become the standard, or simply an option for a few restaurants that can make it work. What is clear after about a year is that it has forced a number of unforeseen changes, large and small, in the places that have embraced it.Because restaurants have for so long relied on tips as an important financial element \u2014 essentially subsidizing the entire payroll for the service staff \u2014 what sounds like a simple policy decision can require a complete overhaul.But some restaurants that adopted a no-tipping policy in 2016 have already revoked it: The New York restaurateurs David Chang, Tom Colicchio and Gabe Stulman all found it unworkable in the small-scale experiments they tried. \u201cWe continue to be supportive of the no-tipping movement,\u201d Mr. Colicchio said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve heard from our customers and team that they just aren\u2019t ready for it yet.\u201dMr. Adler of Huertas, and others, say that one big reason to end tipping is the need for more equity between those who work in kitchens, who earn straight wages, and those who work in dining rooms, who receive tips.A more immediate motivation, local restaurateurs said, was the approach of the $15 minimum wage in 2018, proceeding in New York City on Dec. 31 with a raise to $11 an hour (from $9) for nontipped workers. \u201cLabor is just going to cost more and more, and all restaurants will need to rethink how their people get paid,\u201d Mr. Lavorini said.As the dining business, especially at the high end, attracts more educated and skilled workers, there is increased pressure to treat them fairly, professionally and predictably.With tipping, chaos is a consequence. Servers compete ruthlessly for Saturday night shifts, when tips run high, but many are no-shows for Monday lunch. An experienced line cook who carries $40,000 in debt from years of culinary school earns $12 an hour, while a new server can reap three times that much.Tipping can also prompt servers to nudge customers into ordering more expensive food and wine. And, at its most malign, it encourages servers to accept harassment, whether verbal, sexual or professional.The \u201cautomatic service charge\u201d imposed at many restaurants like Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., and Alinea in Chicago, can redistribute money the same way a no-tipping policy does, although states treat that revenue in different ways.Tips are also handled differently in different states, but in New York, by law, they can be pooled and distributed only to \u201cfront of house\u201d employees: those who work in the dining room, like waiters, bartenders and backwaiters (formerly known as busboys).\u201cThere was regularly a 500 percent deficit between the back of the house and the front of the house,\u201d said Abram Bissell, the executive chef of the Modern. \u201cLike every kitchen in New York, we were having trouble attracting and retaining talent at that pay grade.\u201dRetaining expensively trained staff members is a major concern at the Modern. Along with the new Hospitality Included system, the restaurant started a separate revenue sharing program for the front-of-house staff, so that raises for the other workers would not cost them money. Some left nonetheless, believing that they could earn more in tips than the restaurant could compensate them for. (The Union Square group acknowledged that there had been \u201csome attrition\u201d but would not give specific numbers.)James Napolitano, 25, a bartender, said that most of the bartenders senior to him had left. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have strong skills that they can take anywhere.\u201d But for him, the benefits of a regular schedule and steady income \u2014 with medical insurance, paid leave and revenue sharing \u2014 have proved more valuable.Restaurateurs have learned to proceed carefully with customers, to soothe the pain of sticker shock. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just raise prices 20 percent across the board,\u201d Mr. Lavorini said. The Union Square Hospitality Group analyzes ordering patterns, solicits feedback from customers about pricing and shares data with Michael Lynn, a Cornell professor and expert in the psychology and practice of tipping.One clear lesson: \u201cThere are certain fixed items \u2014 a glass of wine, a bar snack, a cup of coffee \u2014 that affect how guests experience the welcome of the restaurant,\u201d Mr. Lavorini said. The prices of those items stayed where they were, even as others, including those for many bottles of wine, rose by as much as 20 percent.Sticker shock at no-tipping restaurants has affected restaurant owners as well.From 2015 to 2016, the payroll for the Modern\u2019s two dozen front-of-house employees\u2019 hourly wages rose to as much as $30 an hour from $5, through a combination of the rising tipped minimum wage, paid overtime and revenue sharing.Also, restaurants pay taxes on their revenue, but not on income from tips. When service is folded into the price of the meal, the restaurant is taxed on that \u201cadditional\u201d revenue.For Mr. Tarlow, who describes his business as \u201cideal driven,\u201d the challenge has been to maintain those ideals across all aspects of the restaurants in the face of higher costs. As sole owner, \u201cit all comes out of my pocket,\u201d he said, referring not only to higher wages, but also to spending on organic produce, local and artisanal bread, health insurance for employees and other costs that he has decided are nonnegotiable.\u201cThe question is not only, \u2018What will the customer\u2019s pain point be?\u2019\u201d he said \u2014 whether diners will see the $22 charge for a pasta and vegetable dish, and go elsewhere. The question is also: \u201cWhat will our pain point be, what do we give up?\u201dAt Huertas, there is more work for everyone now that both front- and back-of-house staffs have been trimmed. But Mr. Adler says that because the cooks and servers that remained have been made full partners in the enterprise, they work harder and better.Like the Union Square group, which has no plans to revert to tipping, he said his restaurant would stay the course, despite many short-term complications.\u201cIt took hundreds of years to build up the traditions of how things are done in restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to change all of that in one year.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the price increase for the octopus plate at Huertas. It rose to $21 from $16, not $24 from $19.Advertisement"}

She is an author who delights in the intensity of her subject matter \u2014 she has found art in the macabre since wandering through the cemeteries of her native New Orleans as a child. But in person she engages easily.\u201cWhen I put Lestat and the vampires into the mix, it really came to life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of the problems were solved immediately.\u201dMoving on from the kittens and a perturbed-looking preserved monkey, Ms. Rice visited the museum\u2019s library, which contained art fashioned out of the hair of the dead and a few objects of Catholic art that caught her eye. Ms. Rice has a fraught personal history with religion. In 2010, she announced that she had quit Catholicism, saying she objected to what she called anti-gay and anti-feminist views. Her feelings on the faith today, she said, remain the same.\u201cI see myself as a follower of Jesus Christ but not of his followers,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cI think many people feel that way today.\u201dGazing at a portrait of Jesus, Ms. Rice said she was reminded of her late husband, Stan Rice, a poet who died in 2002.\u201cMy husband grew up in the protestant tradition in Texas,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was always astonished when he saw a picture like that, with Jesus\u2019s sacred heart blazing in his chest. But I grew up in New Orleans, in an intense Irish-Catholic community, and that was par for the course.\u201dOn one recent evening, Becket Ghioto, her fan-turned-assistant for more than a decade, traveled with her. The two met when he was studying to become a Benedictine monk. (Ms. Rice needed a harpsichord at a book signing party in New Orleans, and Mr. Ghioto was one of the monks who carted the instrument over from the local monastery.) Having left the monastic lifestyle, Mr. Ghioto now helps operate her Facebook page.These days, Ms. Rice is most interested in conspiracy theories, reading spy thrillers and watching what she calls \u201chigh quality TV\u201d like \u201cThe Crown\u201d on Netflix. She and her son, the novelist Christopher Rice, are exploring how to develop \u201cThe Vampire Chronicles\u201d into a television series. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is the template they would like to follow.When she\u2019s not touring, Ms. Rice writes constantly from a 12-foot-by-12-foot room in a house in La Quinta, Calif. Paradoxically, the writer whose name is synonymous with vampire fiction said she moved from New Orleans to California for the sunlight.She has also written about ghosts, witches and even her cat. But there is one territory of the undead she said she\u2019ll never visit.\u201cI can\u2019t get with zombies,\u201d she said. \u201cI love dealing with a hypersensitive werewolf.

J. Abrams, Tyler Perry and Steven Spielberg. The men have agreed to join Atom\u2019s advisory board. Mr. Abrams and Mr. Perry are also stakeholders; Atom would not say whether Mr. Spielberg had become an investor.Mr. Perry, speaking by phone on Saturday, added, \u201cI\u2019m excited about this because I think it allows my audience to have a better moviegoing experience \u2014 easier, more social.\u201dMr. Abrams compared Atom to other breakthrough technology companies. \u201cIt\u2019s like before there was Uber,\u201d he said by phone on Friday. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know how badly you needed it. When I started using the Atom app, I wished I had it earlier. I couldn\u2019t believe this didn\u2019t already exist.

Because Atom facilitates payment splitting among multiple people, \u201cone poor goat isn\u2019t stuck buying tickets for everyone,\u201d as Mr. Paleja put it.Free to download, Atom collects a surcharge on ticket sales.

But for some actors, etiquette can get complicated when it comes to racial diversity in casting. When a white actor raises the issue with an actor of color, and principles and job opportunities are at stake, should the colleagues be courteous or confrontational? Charitable or chastising?The back-and-forth offers a rare look at how two actors navigate the freighted issue of race in Hollywood. Below is the email exchange provided by Ms. Swinton, followed by a transcript of Ms. Cho last week on the podcast TigerBelly discussing how she felt about the issues raised in the email. The transcripts include annotation by Patrick Healy, deputy Culture editor.THE FIRST EMAILThe first email is from Ms. Swinton to Ms. Cho, with the subject line \u201cStrange matters,\u201d according to Jezebel.Ms. Swinton opens with the pro forma compliment that many actors give each other:Then the lean-in seeking help and offering solidarity:Ms. Swinton expresses confusion about the casting controversy but also has opinions about it:She goes to lengths to defer to Ms. Cho:No wrong answer here. Tell me to [profanity deleted] off if you feel like it. In any and every case,Capped off by an emphatically affectionate salutation: The larger part of the debate has to do with the \u2018whitewashing\u2019 of Asian and Asian Americans in film. Our stories are told by white actors over and over again and we feel at a loss to know how to cope with it.Ms. Swinton opens on a warm and appreciative note:With The Ancient One (the \u2018wise old Eastern geezer\u2019 Fu Manchu type in the book), wanting to switch up the gender (another diversity department) and not wanting to engage with the old \u2018Dragon Lady\u2019 trope, they chose to write the character as being of (ancient) Celtic origin and offered that role to me. Presumably on Ancient grounds. I accepted happily, impressed that, for once, they aimed to disrupt the \u2018wisdom must be male\u2019 never-ending story - and, by the way, for once, wanting to feature a woman who\u2019s a badass, over 26 and not simply bursting out of a bikini.Ms. Swinton defends the filmmakers \u2014 and herself:I\u2019m totally unfamiliar with all the comic books so I can\u2019t speak on anything about that - and the efforts to make this film more diverse is unfortunately lost in the translation here. Hopefully that comes up more when the film comes out and is finally brought to audiences!may 13, 2016By the way, the project I have been developing as a producer over the past two years is with Bong Joon Ho - my colleague from SNOWPIERCER - a film called OKJA shooting this summer in Korea, NYC and Vancouver - to my knowledge the first ever half Korean/half English speaking film, which we are making with Plan B and Netflix, in which the lead is a 14 year old girl from Korea and which stars Steven Yeun, amongst others.. fingers crossed it will be a big deal and help the landscape somewhat.. I hope and believe it will..may 13, 2016Ms. Cho offers some praise:Last week, about seven months later, Ms. Cho appeared on the podcast TigerBelly and spoke with the hosts about her career and opportunities for Asian-Americans and other actors. At one point Ms. Cho brought up the discussion with Ms. Swinton, saying that they were connected by a third party.Ms. Cho makes clear that she had doubts about Ms. Swinton\u2019s motives for emailing:Ms. Cho discloses that, in her view, the email exchange was contentious:Ms. Cho delivers a punch:And, um, basically, it ended with her saying, well, \u2018I\u2019m producing a movie with Steven Yeun starring.\u2019But then relents a bit.I had a weird feeling about the entire exchange. Especially the part of, \u2018don\u2019t tell anybody. After Ms. Swinton released the email, Ms. Cho gave a statement to Entertainment Weekly: \u201cAsian actors should play Asian roles. I believe my emails stand on their own and should be taken for the spirit in which they were intended. I am grateful that the debate has now entered the national discussion and remain a huge fan of Tilda\u2019s.\u201dMs. Cho, having the final word for now, is more blunt about Asian roles than she was in her email to Ms. Swinton. But she ends on a note, once again, of air kisses and flattery.Advertisement"}

It was Mr. Ali\u2019s fourth interview since the nomination was revealed barely 30 minutes earlier, and many more chats with other reporters lay ahead: Mr. Ali is this year\u2019s it-guy.\u201cThis whole experience has caught me off guard,\u201d Mr. Ali said. \u201cIt\u2019s all really new \u2014 being nominated on this stage, among this peer group. Being involved in a film where my work is being individually recognized, as well as the film.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of positive talk and absolutely I appreciate the nomination, but I think in some ways none of it\u2019s real until it\u2019s happening.\u201dThe thing is, it is happening: He has already collected eight supporting-actor awards from various critics\u2019 groups for his role as Juan, the drug dealer with a heart of gold in \u201cMoonlight.\u201d This year had already been an outstanding one for him. Weeks before \u201cMoonlight\u201d had its premiere at film festivals, he landed an Emmy nomination for outstanding guest actor in a drama series, for \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\u201cI was on my way out with that show, I\u2019d done it for four years, I wasn\u2019t expecting it at all,\u201d Mr. Ali said of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the Netflix drama. He added, \u201cI was really trying to get new work that I connected to, and keeping it moving forward. So the \u2018House of Cards\u2019 stuff was really a surprise. I\u2019ve kept on \u2014 \u2014\u201d\u201cExcuse me, sorry,\u201d a publicist on the phone interjected just then, at the 3-minute-45-second mark. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wrap it up.\u201dThe Bagger tried to rush in last-minute questions: Did Mr. Ali get up extra early for the Globes nominations? What was he doing when they came in?The publicist sighed audibly, and Mr. Ali managed to squeeze in a few words \u2014 \u201cI was up early, I get up early,\u201d he said \u2014 before she jumped back in, saying to the Bagger, \u201cWe really have to go; we\u2019ll try to call you back.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Mr. Ali said gently. The Bagger bade farewell, and Mr. Ali\u2019s people texted later to apologize and ask if more time was needed. The Bagger said it was O.K. We\u2019ll doubtlessly meet again as the season churns ahead.\u2014 CARA BUCKLEYOn some days, at \u201cWestworld,\u201d the HBO series about a futuristic Old West theme park populated with sentient automatons called \u201chosts,\u201d Evan Rachel Wood is Dolores Abernathy, a rancher\u2019s daughter living a seemingly contented life. On other days, Ms. Wood is Dolores Abernathy, a host who senses there is much more to her existence than she has been told. And then there are those days when she goes even farther off the map.On Monday morning, Ms. Wood was adjusting to another new identity: Being a Golden Globe nominee for best actress in a television drama for the HBO show, which, in its first season, was also nominated for best TV drama. (Her co-star Thandie Newton was also nominated for supporting actress.)Ms. Wood spoke on Monday about her nomination, making \u201cWestworld\u201d and what the future might hold for the series. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.I was so nervous. That was my first acting award. I feel like Dolores is going to be the character I\u2019m most remembered for, and I\u2019m really O.K. with that.Did you know the journey that Dolores was going to go on over the course of the season?I understood on some level, but all I knew about the character was how she begins this season. I don\u2019t think I even knew who the rest of the cast was. It was all very hush-hush. I had no idea I was going to be playing about five different characters, and different spectrums and emotions. It wasn\u2019t until about Episode 4 that I truly realized what show I was on.Since you didn\u2019t know the story in advance, did you and your co-stars spend a lot of time coming up with your own theories? Oh my God, constantly. I\u2019m sure I drove the rest of the actors crazy with all my theories. I had about 1,000, and maybe three were right. So I really sympathize with all the viewers. [Laughs] But what I love about the show is that you\u2019re supposed to put the pieces together, and part of the fun is figuring it out. I\u2019m just happy I don\u2019t have to keep any of those secrets anymore. It was painful.I don\u2019t want to spoil too much for viewers who haven\u2019t seen it, but what was it like for you to be part of such a bonkers season finale?I can\u2019t stop watching the finale. Shooting it was just so intense, and we were filming, I think, three episodes simultaneously. I was hopping back and forth between Episode 9 and Episode 10 and Episode 8, playing the same character but different variations on that character. Hopping from different sets and going, \u201cO.K., what episode are we in? What time are we in? Who am I? O.K., go.\u201d But I think it really helped inform my performance. Because I\u2019m supposed to be in a dream and lost, and trying to figure things out.Have you been briefed yet on what\u2019s in store for Season 2?I\u2019ve heard murmurs and hints. The only thing I do know is that Dolores is going to be very different in Season 2. And might not even really be Dolores anymore.Have you been fitted for a kimono?Not quite yet. But I\u2019m hoping my black-belt skills can come in handy at some point. I got that going for me.\u2014 DAVE ITZKOFFRyan Reynolds was changing his eight-week-old baby when notification tones began coming from his phone.\u201cI suddenly heard my phone pinging and it didn\u2019t stop,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said, quickly realizing that it wasn\u2019t a typical Monday morning. \u201cIf you\u2019re not nominated, you\u2019re not going to get that many text messages.\u201dThe Globe nomination followed a celebratory weekend for Mr. Reynolds, 40, who on Sunday won the Critics\u2019 Choice Award for entertainer of the year.While Mr. Reynolds is grateful for his Globe nomination, he said the fact that the film itself is in the running for a Globe (for best comedy or musical, a category that includes the front-runner \u201cLa La Land\u201d) is the bigger victory.\u201cThe film breaks a proverbial black glass ceiling; movies in this particular genre don\u2019t usually get award nominations,\u201d he said, adding, in a reference to the 11 years it took to get \u201cDeadpool\u201d made, \u201cThe long game very rarely pays off; sticking with something that long, you have to have some form of brain damage and I think I do.\u201dMr. Reynolds has played a superhero before, in the 2011 \u201cGreen Lantern,\u201d and he said the decision to continue fighting for \u201cDeadpool\u201d was partly the result of a \u201csnowball effect.\u201d\u201cIt became more and more appropriate with every passing year as we reached peak superhero,\u201d he said. \u201cThis character really ran counter to everything the other guys were doing. It was really just a character that I felt I could do complete justice.\u201dThough he admits to being behind on movie watching, he is rooting for \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and Tom Hanks this awards season. (The first two picked up Golden Globe nominations on Monday; Mr. Hanks, who starred in \u201cSully,\u201d was shut out.)But before he can binge-watch the performances of his fellow nominees, it\u2019s back to work on \u201cDeadpool 2.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve all this morning just been high-fiving each other and talking, it\u2019s been a really great moment,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen you have four grown men engage in a tickle fight on a hotel bed in their bathrobes, everybody wins,\u201d he said.\u2014 TAMARA BESTAmong the veteran shows that were nominated for the best comedy or musical Golden Globe on Monday, one rookie found its way into the pack: \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Donald Glover\u2019s FX series about a young man trying to help his cousin start a rap career, earned a nomination in its first season. Mr. Glover was also nominated for best actor in a TV musical or comedy series. They are the latest distinctions for \u201cAtlanta,\u201d a category-stretching show that, beyond its narrative premise, finds innovative ways to address race, class, gender, social media and Justin Bieber.Mr. Glover spoke on Monday about finding a voice (and an audience) for \u201cAtlanta,\u201d and the show\u2019s relationship with his recording career as Childish Gambino. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.How did you find out about your nominations today? Is it fair to say that the sensibility of \u201cAtlanta\u201d comes, in part, from feeling like an underdog, or not having a place to express these ideas?There\u2019s a through-line that\u2019s a bit of an antihero about \u201cAtlanta,\u201d an underdog, a Charlie Brown type, maybe. But I think now, more than ever, it\u2019s hard to have intelligent conversation. We tried to make that active. Everything is divided right now, and nobody is willing to talk about perspective. So we just tried to give our show a very specific point of view. And also be fair to other points of view. Which you can\u2019t do on the internet.Do you feel like you can still hold on to that spirit now that the show is getting critical acclaim and recognition for awards?I actually do. I don\u2019t think people are connecting because they feel like the underdog. People are connecting because there\u2019s an honesty that you don\u2019t get in a lot of places anymore. We\u2019ve never tried to be important. That helps us a little bit.We\u2019ve just had a presidential election that reminded many people of perspectives very different from their own. Do you think \u201cAtlanta\u201d can reach audiences beyond its intended viewership base?I think that audience is actually super into our show. Because they want to know different points of view. If you give people something they\u2019ve never seen before, they gravitate to that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to make everybody happy, and that\u2019s a really good thing, actually. That\u2019s why people come back. It\u2019s like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos. You keep eating them, even though they taste a little rough.No. They definitely asked what was going on sometimes. But they wanted us to succeed. We always wanted to make something punk.\u2014 DAVE ITZKOFFYour film \u201cWhiplash\u201d won three Oscars in 2015. Can you compare being on the awards circuit with that movie to now with \u201cLa La Land\u201d? In both cases, I\u2019ve been a little taken aback and surprised by the response to these films. It has seemed even more intense with this movie than with \u201cWhiplash.\u201d It was such a new experience then and I had no real knowledge of the awards scene. It felt really busy. But now I look back and it seems like that was a lot less busy and intense than it is now. I guess I\u2019m still learning as I go, but in both cases it\u2019s been so rewarding and fun.What\u2019s the most interesting thing you\u2019ve been hearing people say about \u201cLa La Land\u201d?The idea of people getting to take some comfort, some amount of hope or joy from it, some reminder of the beautiful things in the world, is good. I hoped that those things would come across, but sometimes you get into the thick of it with a movie and you just kind of want to make sure you\u2019re telling your story effectively. I started working on this movie about six years ago, so everything both in my life and in the world at large is different. I am surprised by the way in which, now, people really seem to be responding to those things about it.You certainly have found success. Could you talk about making films like \u201cWhiplash\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d where characters are chasing that kind of success?I\u2019m aware that both are about trying to find that balance between life and art and I think in both cases, I wanted to be cognizant of the sacrifices that go into that. With \u201cWhiplash,\u201d I wanted to look at the dark side of that equation. Here, I wanted to be aware of the pain and sacrifices but look at it in a more hopeful way. This was about the beauty of chasing a dream.A lot of people seeing this movie coming after an intense and difficult election year seem to be embracing it as escapism. Do you find the movie escapist and do you look for that in the movies?Movies are one of the more transporting art forms, and there\u2019s something about them that absolutely can be an escape. But I prefer to think of movies and musicals as less escapist and more like you\u2019re temporarily putting on a different set of glasses to look at the world. A lot of the great old Hollywood movies, whether westerns, musicals or comedies, did actually wind up saying something about the society in which they were made. But they do it through metaphor. And I think that\u2019s a more powerful idea than that of mere escapism.\u2014 MEKADO MURPHYAdvertisement"}

Here he redirected his analytic mind to his paralyzing grief, mocking the language of recovery, preferring \u201cnumb slog\u201d to \u201chealing journey.\u201d At his most moving, Mr. Oswalt told self-deprecating stories that doubled as tributes to his wife, the writer Michelle McNamara. In one of their running arguments, he recalled, she would quarrel with his notion that \u201ceverything happens for a reason.\u201d After mapping out this debate, he paused, adding, \u201cShe won the argument in the worst way.\u201dTwo years earlier on Twitter, Mr. Oswalt singled out jokes from the comic and \u201cConan\u201d writer Laurie Kilmartin, who was tweeting about her father\u2019s dying of lung cancer. These sharply written one-liners captured the pain and frustration of caring for a dying loved one (\u201cHospice is a medical term that means \u201cHere, you do it\u201d), and they evolved into a special, \u201c45 Jokes About My Dead Dad,\u201d having its premiere on Seeso on Thursday. It\u2019s a slightly deceptive title, since the jokes cover a broad swath of territory, including the impossibility of predicting someone\u2019s last breath and more than a few sharp jabs at her mother, but the main focus is on walking the audience through the treatment, recovery, raised hopes and hard realism of helping a loved one die with dignity.But Ms. Kilmartin touched on the toughest moments of mourning without a note of the maudlin. \u201cEver cry so hard and so thoroughly,\u201d she asks, with deliberate pace, before shifting into the absurd, \u201cthat when you finish you like jazz?\u201dDoug Stanhope is a more argumentative and polemical comic, and in the first chapter of his book \u201cDigging Up Mother,\u201d he described the death of his mother in the meticulous detail of someone fascinated by all things uncomfortable and taboo. While he talked about her in a previous stand-up special, this lucid account, deadpan but too impertinent to be called clinical, is even more harrowing and funny. He relates her final moments soberly, lets her have the amusing lines, but once she dies, he destroys any trace of solemnity. \u201cMother was in a better place now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd by that, I mean she wasn\u2019t all dead and drooling in a hospital bed in my living room while I was trying to watch football.\u201dWhile the jokes and comedian personas are as shaped as the dialogue and characters in movies, they feel more real. We trust stand-up comics in a way that we don\u2019t for almost any other artist, and it\u2019s part of the reason they have such stature in our culture now. That\u2019s why when they joke about death, it can come across like a friend\u2019s sharing intimate secrets. And that allows them leeway to express themselves without euphemism.What stand-ups proved this year is that just because humor can provide comfort doesn\u2019t make it comic relief. Jokes can help an audience hear difficult things more clearly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Murdochs Take Another Shot at Sky", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe Murdochs are having another shot at Sky. On Friday, 21st Century Fox offered to buy the 61 percent of Sky, the European pay-TV group, that it does not own. The proposal notionally values Sky at 18.5 billion pounds ($23 billion), though only about \u00a311.3 billion would change hands. Circumstances look a lot more auspicious than the last time Rupert Murdoch and his family tried to consolidate the business, in 2010.Back then, a phone-hacking scandal at publications owned by News Corporation, which then held the Sky stake, helped doom the attempt, and it was abandoned the next summer. Questions regarding plans for Sky have swirled since. Fox sold its stakes in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland back to Sky in 2014. Then James Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chief executive, returned as chairman of Sky.By July this year, as Breakingviews noted, signs were emerging that another tilt at Sky might be coming. For one thing, its shares had steadily declined since the start of the year, making it look increasingly cheap. By Thursday, they were down nearly 30 percent.The \u00a310.75-per-share bid values the Sky enterprise at a bit under 12 times estimated 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. The offer is still below where the shares started the year. But investors were not buying Sky\u2019s growth story, despite a recent day of presentations and the launch of new mobile services in Britain. And a 40 percent premium to the undisturbed price is hardly stingy.For Fox, fully owning Sky would simplify its operating model, a big initiative under James Murdoch. It also gives the media and entertainment conglomerate direct access to consumers, helping Fox compete as more people sign up for video-streaming rivals like Netflix.Much has changed since 2010. Fox has spun off its newspapers, distancing itself from the hacking scandal. Media firms and content distributors are rapidly consolidating around the world, as shown by AT&T\u2019s plan to buy Time Warner after already having acquired DirecTV. Though there could still be concerns about the Murdochs\u2019 excessive influence, the political environment in Britain is less hostile. Politicians may be distracted by \u201cBrexit\u201d preparations, too. The terms of the deal still have to be completed, but Fox\u2019s latest reach for Sky looks well timed.Advertisement"}

Prairie Johnson (Ms. Marling), the young woman on the bridge from that viral video, turns up after a seven-year disappearance, changed: She was blind when she vanished, and now she can see. She refers to herself without explanation, as \u201cThe OA.\u201dFragile and tentative, she moves back home to a Michigan suburb with her parents (Alice Krige and Scott Wilson) but won\u2019t share details of her disappearance with them or the authorities. Instead, she opens up to a group of four teenage boys and their algebra teacher (Phyllis Smith), gathering them in an abandoned house for an unspecified \u201cmission.\u201dThe story that very slowly emerges (involving Jason Isaacs and Riz Ahmed in roles it\u2019s best not to detail) is part suburban melodrama, part sci-fi crime story, part shamanic ritual. It touches on near-death experiences and the rings of Saturn. It has the misfits-coming-together themes of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the cosmic connections of \u201cSense8\u201d and a dream-journal preciousness all its own.Her performance is almost enough to make you believe that Prairie could get five strangers to buy into a wildly far-fetched story. It is almost enough to get you past the thinness of its characters \u2014 the tormented bully, the lonely Eleanor Rigby of a teacher \u2014 and the stock dreariness of its suburbs. It is not quite enough to sell writerly lines like, \u201cI\u2019m at the end of a rope I should have fallen off a long time ago.\u201dLike so many streaming series, \u201cThe OA\u201d feels long for length\u2019s sake. It spends vast stretches with supporting characters without developing them. It\u2019s a two-hour movie with a seven-hour-plus run time.The season becomes a thriller of sorts, but as it burrows into Prairie\u2019s missing years, its real interest is in exploring the nature of consciousness. It\u2019s a dreamcatcher of a story that works better the closer it gets to pure abstraction and fantasy. Mr. Batmanglij, the director, creates otherworldly images to represent altered mind states.It\u2019s the reality that disappoints: No one in this story seems drawn from life, whether we see them from Prairie\u2019s perspective or from outside it.The best thing I can say about \u201cThe OA\u201d is that I\u2019m glad it has a chance to exist. Unlike cable channels, which program to a specific brand identity, Netflix is pitching the broadest tent since the early days of television. In the same month, it has released Season 2 of \u201cFuller House\u201d and this, a more idiosyncratic and daring series than anything HBO has shown since \u201cJohn From Cincinnati.\u201dRisks like this are polarizing. To me, the ending of \u201cThe OA\u201d was ludicrous and cheaply provocative; some folks wired differently may find it haunting and profound. Just beware. This wonder box is gorgeously gift-wrapped, but the time you\u2019ll invest in it is nonreturnable.Advertisement"}

They responded in a way that struck me as even more curious, acting as if I\u2019d asked them for their credit cards.There are a lot of holiday movies, and there are a lot more Christmas-themed holiday movies than Hanukkah-themed holiday movies (\u201cEight Crazy Nights,\u201d 2002, an animated \u201ctribute\u201d to Hanukkah that stars Adam Sandler, can be bought starting at $2.99 from iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu and Google Play, incidentally), and most holiday movies aren\u2019t very good. There aren\u2019t many as bad as \u201cZombie Lake,\u201d but as we\u2019ve already established \u2026 well, you know. Holiday Classic almost never equals Actual Classic. So here I\u2019d like to recommend a few holiday movies that are at least interesting.Netflix offers a bounty of the conventionally beloved (which also means widely disparaged) holiday pictures on its streaming service. Yes, there\u2019s \u201cLove Actually\u201d (2003); the increasingly well-liked \u201cScrooged\u201d (1988) (Bill Murray\u2019s latter-day sainthood has done a lot for this picture, which was greeted with tepid reviews on its theatrical release nearly 30 years ago); and the 1954 perennial \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d Starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney (in a relatively rare film role), this chestnut remains a very relaxed and genteel viewing experience, and has lots of pleasant Irving Berlin tunes. It can be an exceptional holiday decompressant.There\u2019s also a very unusual picture on Filmstruck: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s \u201cA Carol for Another Christmas\u201d (1964), a made-for-TV oddity. It has a nonsensically star-studded cast: Sterling Hayden is lectured by both Ben Gazzara and Steve Lawrence. Britt Ekland has a blink-and-you-miss-it silent cameo. This was actually one of four TV movies commissioned by the United Nations to foster the notion of world peace. Rod Serling\u2019s script recasts Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d to teach its own Scrooge (here named \u201cGrudge\u201d and played by Hayden) to stop worrying and love international cooperation. It plays pretty much exactly as you\u2019d expect a Rod Serling version of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d to play. It\u2019s spectacularly dated (although Peter Sellers\u2019s work as a future demagogue has a certain timeless quality), but if you want to boggle your movie-buff kin, this will do the trick.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Communal TV Screens in a Binge-Watching Age? Won\u2019t Do, Airlines", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byItinerariesWhat airline passenger hasn\u2019t felt the letdown?You board a long-haul flight, ready to settle in for hours of binge-watching a popular television series or movie franchise, only to discover the plane\u2019s onboard entertainment is stuck in a time warp, offering outdated content or \u2014 in a throwback to the 1990s \u2014 communal television screens for the whole cabin.For a public increasingly accustomed to nearly ubiquitous internet access, with on-demand video and continuous social media feeds, the airline cabin too often feels like a final, frustrating frontier.But David Dicko, a French entrepreneur, is among the many taking aim at in-flight entertainment ennui.\u201cPeople on planes are hungry for different entertainment options,\u201d said Mr. Dicko, whose small team of developers, split between California and France, has been testing the headsets on flights for nearly a year. Last week, XL Airways \u2014 a low-cost, long-haul French carrier \u2014 became the first airline to offer a commercial version of SkyLights service to passengers for $16 a flight.\u201cPutting virtual reality headsets inside an aircraft is an idea as old as virtual reality itself,\u201d said Mr. Dicko, who previously worked as a pilot for Air France-KLM, referring to the decades-old hope of offering passengers 3-D-style entertainment.It is all in recognition of how media-dependent today\u2019s travelers have become. Many, even most, are accustomed to almost universal internet access through home broadband and mobile internet packages. They are also likely to have subscriptions to video services like Hulu or music services like Spotify. And because many travelers now carry smartphones and tablets on planes, they would like to have the option of viewing and listening to such content, even at 30,000 feet.Analysts say that digital access and entertainment could help airlines, particularly American carriers that are completing a decade-long restructuring, differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive domestic and international market. Consumers can easily shift allegiances if a rival airline offers new amenities like high-speed onboard Wi-Fi.\u201cFor the legacy carriers, imitating passengers\u2019 experiences at home is their vision,\u201d said Diogenis Papiomytis, an aerospace analyst with the technology research firm Frost & Sullivan in Dubai. \u201cThey want to provide seamless connectivity from airport, to aircraft, to when you land at your final destination.\u201dBut technical challenges remain.In the past, experts say, airlines\u2019 attempts to bring connectivity to aircraft have been hampered by telecommunications technology that soon became outdated or was quickly overwhelmed by unexpectedly high consumer demand.Until very recently, internet services on Delta and American Airlines, among others, were sluggish at best, although airline executives say connectivity speeds are improving. And many of the in-flight entertainment services on decades-old planes have not been upgraded to keep pace with what many travelers can readily gain access to on their smartphones or other mobile devices.About 2,600 commercial aircraft currently use Gogo services. And by the end of this month, about 75 of those planes will have been upgraded to give users internet speeds comparable to what their smartphones can provide on the ground, according to John Wade, Gogo\u2019s chief operating officer. As many as 450 additional planes are to receive similar improvements next year, he said.The new high-speed services are available on aircraft from Delta and Virgin Atlantic, among others, and represent a significant upgrade to Gogo\u2019s existing connectivity options, which have mainly been limited to sending emails or checking social media.Travelers can pay hourly to upgrade if they want to use faster speeds for online gaming and other bandwidth-heavy activities. ViaSat plans to expand internationally next year with deals with the likes of Qantas and SAS, and extend its global coverage through two additional satellites by 2019.\u201cWi-Fi is becoming part of a carrier\u2019s amenity package,\u201d said Don Buchman, vice president for ViaSat\u2019s commercial mobility division. \u201cIf drinks and peanuts are free, why shouldn\u2019t Wi-Fi?\u201dAnd what might the in-flight entertainment system of the future look like?Ana\u00efs Marzo, head of aircraft interiors marketing at Airbus, the European aircraft giant, said that passengers now wanted almost constant access to their social media feeds, email accounts and other digital services. But she said that would not detract from traditional onboard options and seat-back television screens, particularly in business or first class where large high-definition displays are now the norm.\u201cMore and more people are relying on their own devices on board,\u201d Ms. Marzo said, adding that about 60 percent of Airbus\u2019s worldwide fleet, or 16,500 planes, will have some sort of internet connectivity by 2025. But having a smartphone, she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t exclude using a back-of-seat display.\u201dOthers are not so sure.Some airline executives say that travelers\u2019 increasing reliance on their own devices is making carriers review their existing onboard entertainment options. Heavy built-in screens and the miles of fiber-optic cable that serve them, they note, can add significant weight \u2014 and cost \u2014 to every flight.Vincent Tomasoni is head of product at XL Airways, the French carrier that, along with offering passengers Skylights\u2019 new 3-D headsets, also rents tablets to its onboard customers. He says the ability to offer streaming content over in-flight Wi-Fi represents a change for many airlines.Passengers can continue using their own devices while accessing a larger pool of movies, television shows and radio programs, he said, enabling airlines to consider scrapping traditional in-flight entertainment hardware and reducing the cost and complexity of such services.\u201cThe world of seat-backed entertainment is over,\u201d Mr. Tomasoni said.That is where Mr. Dicko hopes to step in with his SkyLights 3-D headset.Since Mr. Dicko\u2019s company was founded 18 months ago, he and his team have flown thousands of miles to test the headset with passengers. They also are looking to sign more content partnerships beyond those SkyLights currently has with 21st Century Fox and DreamWorks, to offer a larger number of 3-D movies \u2014 and potentially other virtual reality content \u2014 to travelers.\u201cAirlines are difficult players to deal with because they are risk-averse and slow to innovate,\u201d said Mr. Dicko, whose team has tested the SkyLights system with seven carriers worldwide, including Air France-KLM.\u201cWe needed their own passengers to tell them that they liked our headset,\u201d he added. \u201cAt first, people would only use it for 15 minutes. But now, they\u2019re using it for four hours.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lawmakers Change Their Tone on AT&T and Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byAt a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that was being closely watched for how mega-mergers will be viewed in the coming Trump administration, members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees regulatory agencies that decide on mergers said the deal merited tough scrutiny. The chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner were grilled at the hearing about a range of issues related to the deal.But in a change from previous comments, lawmakers also questioned whether traditional ways of evaluating mergers are growing outdated as Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google become massive media platforms that threaten the television industry. Their tone was more circumspect than those that immediately followed the deal\u2019s announcement, when lawmakers had been more critical.\u201cWe want to ensure that competition thrives in this critical market and we don\u2019t stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who heads the full Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley said Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have transformed the video landscape.Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, said the deal would combine companies that did not directly compete against one another. \u201cThe consumer is benefited from the aggregation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is called capitalism.\u201dOver all, senators were asking \u201chard questions,\u201d said Larry Downes, a professor at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough School of Business. But, he added, \u201cthey seem to be open-minded about the changing nature of competition in the information sector.\u201dAT&T, a telecom giant, and Time Warner, which owns CNN and HBO, had said in October that AT&T would buy Time Warner to create a mobile video powerhouse. The hearing may have implications beyond this deal, with the comments potentially encouraging more acquisitions by companies that have been waiting out the Obama administration, which has rejected several mergers.\u201cThe D.O.J. pays particularly close attention to Senate and House antitrust subcommittees because they oversee the D.O.J.,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company, who added that the committee\u2019s commentary \u201cbears watching for its potential effect on the D.O.J.\u201d Members of the Justice Department attended the hearing.When the deal was announced, days before the presidential election, leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued strong cautionary statements about it. Donald J. Trump, on the campaign trail at the time, said he would block the merger if elected. He has singled out CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner, with particular rancor for its election coverage.As president, Mr. Trump will have no direct power over mergers, but he will greatly influence which ones are approved, depending on whom he picks to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust or the chairman of the F.C.C. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, told CNBC before the hearing that he had not had contact with the Trump transition team.During the hearing, the companies pitched a message that catered to the new administration: a populist promise of lower prices and the potential to build more wireless infrastructure through the merger. While AT&T and Time Warner are powerhouses, they presented themselves as weaker rivals to the cable industry and Silicon Valley tech companies.Mr. Stephenson said in prepared remarks that cable companies dominated the broadband and television market, serving high-speed internet to eight of every 10 American homes that have broadband service. To experiment with new mobile video technologies, he said, AT&T needed to have in-house content to quickly try new streaming services at a lower cost. He added that AT&T had just introduced a streaming service with 100 channels for less than most cable television packages.\u201cIt is only the beginning of what we want to bring to the marketplace to threaten cable\u2019s entrenched and still-dominant market position,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. He said AT&T would give CNN editorial independence if the merger were approved.Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, \u201cIt is not enough to deliver great content.\u201d The companies\u2019 competitors have multiplied, he said.No lawmakers at the hearing said the merger should be blocked, but several expressed skepticism.\u201cI have serious concerns about this transaction,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. The deal \u201cpotentially has serious negative impacts on competition and on consumers.\u201dMark Cuban, an internet entrepreneur and owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, who also spoke at the hearing, said the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. \u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Consumer groups rejected the characterization of AT&T and Time Warner as disadvantaged rivals, saying a combined company would create a powerhouse that all cable providers and networks would have to negotiate with. Streaming providers like Sling TV and Hulu would face a major new competitor, with AT&T\u2019s access to 110 million wireless and satellite subscribers and premium television networks under the same roof, the groups said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Character Building: Brit Marling", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byThe premise of \u201cThe OA,\u201d which debuts today on Netflix, is irresistible: A blind woman, gone missing from her suburban town seven years ago, suddenly returns with her sight restored. She\u2019s started calling herself \u201cthe OA,\u201d and she won\u2019t tell anyone what\u2019s happened to her, except a motley group of four teenage boys and their middle-aged teacher. To reveal any more would be a disservice \u2014 the show hinges on very deliberate dissemination of information \u2014 but suffice it to say that its plot is labyrinthine, compulsively compelling and often absolutely bonkers.The OA, in particular, was inspired in part by a woman Marling met at a party who\u2019d had a near-death experience. \u201cShe crossed over some liminal space,\u201d Marling says, \u201clike she\u2019s confronted or had a conversation with death that enabled her to be alive with a kind of vibrancy that feels otherworldly.\u201d That meeting led Marling and Batmanglij to research the phenomena that accompany near-death experiences \u2014 including instances of survivors returning with new, unusual skills like perfect pitch or sudden language fluency.It was one of several areas of study for the two writers in creating the story. They also embedded with high schoolers in the Midwest to fine-tune their teenage characters, and Marling spent time with a blind man in New York learning to navigate the city without eyesight. \u201cAt first, it was completely terrifying, just to put a blindfold on and will yourself to not take it off and to just be in the dark for six hours,\u201d she says, \u201cfiguring out how to get to a place and developing the humility to constantly ask people you can\u2019t even see for help, and you have no idea what their facial reaction is.\u201dAll of these elements came together to create a complicated narrative that is uniquely suited to the medium of a streaming service: For the story she tells, a film would be too short \u2014\u00a0and traditional TV programming, where viewers have to wait an entire week between episodes, wouldn\u2019t help the show\u2019s momentum. \u201cMany of the main characters you don\u2019t meet until four hours in, and lots of things were really against the design of how most \u2018television\u2019 works,\u201d Ms. Marling says. \u201cWe wanted to construct something that was more like a delicious mystery novel.\u201d That flexibility allowed Marling and Batmanglij to write a show in which experimental narrative was important not just to the frame of the show \u2014 but to its content, too. \u201cThere was always this idea of the young woman who\u2019s a trauma survivor who becomes a storyteller as a way of healing herself from this trauma she\u2019s experienced,\u201d Marling says, \u201cand the young teenage boys she recruits end up needing the story as much as she needs them.\u201d Below, Brit Marling discusses several influences that shaped \u201cThe OA.\u201d\u201cHayao Miyazaki\u2019s female characters are always very developed and layered. San, the wolf princess, and Lady Eboshi, the ruler of Irontown, are vivid portraits of women. They have a ferocity and complexity to them that I often see in women in the real world but not as often onscreen.\u201d\u201cThis story touches a lot of dark places, but ultimately reaches for something very bright and expansive. Sometimes while I was working on the character in my imagination, I would listen to Rostam\u2019s song, and it would remind me of that dazzle. (Rostam, along with Danny Bensi & Saunder Jurriaans, composed all the music for \u2018The OA.\u2019)\u201d\u201cIs there anyone more mysterious than Clarice Lispector and her protagonist, G.H.? The metaphysical journey that character goes through and the way it nearly tears her to pieces and ultimately rebuilds her was inspiring to me. It\u2019s like she has her own kind of near-death experience. \u2018We miss our impossible grandeur \u2014 my unreachable present is my paradise lost.\u2019\u201d\u201cIn kidnapping stories, the female character is often stuck in a kind of passive victimhood. I wanted OA\u2019s recovery from trauma to feel active and alive. I liked the idea of a woman who claims to be on an otherworldly mission in ordinary sports apparel. It begs movement.\u201d\u201cI like the sense of sharp-edged mystery in this song, and the feeling of a character who is broken but has a certain shine because of that brokenness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For \u2018Trollhunters,\u2019 Guillermo del Toro Found Inspiration in the Sewers", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byWESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. \u2014 When Guillermo del Toro was 11, he and his friends would explore the vast sewer system below his hometown, Guadalajara, Mexico. Although he never found anything too fantastical on his subterranean forays, the idea of vast cities and civilizations beneath our own has entranced him ever since.Mr. Del Toro, the director of \u201cPacific Rim\u201d and \u201cCrimson Peak,\u201d returns to the underworld with \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d a 26-episode DreamWorks Animation series on Netflix, starting Dec. 23. The series is set in Arcadia, a fictional American suburb, as well as the secret subterranean city beneath it. In the first episode, a magical amulet chooses Jim Lake Jr. (voiced by Anton Yelchin), a kindhearted and lovelorn high school student, to become the Trollhunter, a protector of good trolls and a scourge of the evil ones.While Mr. del Toro has made his name on scarier, creepier fare like \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d (a fairy tale populated by sadistic military officers and sentient stickbugs in 1944 Spain), \u201cHellboy\u201d (an action fantasy film about a demon spawn called up from the netherworld by Nazis) and \u201cThe Strain\u201d (a horror TV series starring vampires with stinging, prehensile tongues), \u201cTrollhunters\u201d is decidedly more family friendly.\u201cI wanted to do a series that I could imagine watching with a glass of milk on the couch with my dad and my brothers,\u201d he said.\u201cI do not lead a normal life,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend my day surrounded by creatures.\u201dA lifelong lover of fairy tales, Mr. del Toro recalled a Brothers Grimm story about a king who offered his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage to anyone who could hold her attention. Three brothers go to the kingdom. The youngest is something of a scatterbrain, picking up a piece of string here, a dead bird there. \u201cHis brothers laugh at him,\u201d Mr. del Toro said, \u201cbut eventually he uses those objects to keep the interest of the princess.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve always got my head in the clouds, looking at the floor, picking up string that nobody picks up, and enshrining it.\u201dHere are four of the magical elements from \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d and a few of the bits of string that informed them.To summon his magical armor and sword, the Trollhunter calls upon a mystical golden talisman, which serves as both a source of his power and a symbol of his high office. Visually, the amulet is \u201ca cross between an Arabian astrolabe and a clock\u201d; its spinning gears evoke \u201ca kind of Arthurian steampunk,\u201d Mr. del Toro said.To make the thing work, its master must speak the magic words, much like Ali Baba\u2019s \u201cOpen Sesame,\u201d or Green Lantern\u2019s overly wordy, battery-charging oath. \u201cEvery talisman needs an incantation,\u201d Mr. del Toro said. The Trollhunter\u2019s oath \u2014 \u201cFor the glory of Merlin, daylight is mine to command\u201d \u2014 is, of course, straight out of Arthurian legend. \u201cIt also hints at some of the deeper origins that we\u2019re going to explore in the series,\u201d Mr. del Toro said.The Trollhunter\u2019s gleaming armor was inspired by the polished chrome beauties in John Boorman\u2019s 1981 fantasy \u201cExcalibur.\u201d In that film, the armor of King Arthur and his knights was constantly bathed in an eerie emerald glow (green lights placed offstage created the effect), a visual signature that Mr. del Toro borrowed for his own. \u201cWe did a little nod to Boorman,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time you see Jim, there\u2019s a green light that comes from nowhere.\u201dUnlike with Arthur\u2019s suit, however, no loyal page is required to help put it on: When needed, the armor magically attaches piece by piece to the Trollhunter\u2019s body. \u201cThat is complete Japanese animation,\u201d he said, occurring in anime including \u201cRonin Warriors\u201d and \u201cErza Scarlet.\u201dIn addition to trolls, gnomes and changelings, Arcadia has goblins, lots of them. Mr. del Toro\u2019s vengeful creatures, all flashing canines and skittering little legs, are based on Anglo-Saxon myths going back centuries. (The director consulted a book from his own collection, \u201cBritish Goblins,\u201d an obscure 1880 tome, to help create his modern-day versions.)The visual heart of the series, Troll Market is a subterranean metropolis pulsing with energy and jewel-fueled light, where trolls eat, fight and down brews in pubs straight out of Viking lore. The works of the comic book artist Richard Corben inspired the city\u2019s grand scale and purple-and-orange color scheme. \u201cThere is a pulp energy to Richard Corben that no one else gives me,\u201d Mr. del Toro said.Every del Toro creation has an underworld, be they cellars (\u201cCrimson Peak\u201d), labyrinths (\u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d) or monster-infested sewers (\u201cHellboy\u201d). As a child, Mr. del Toro was entranced by the underground treasure troves of \u201cThe Arabian Nights\u201d; later, he fell in love with the 1973 made-for-TV movie \u201cThe Night Strangler,\u201d which featured scenes shot in downtown Seattle\u2019s famed network of tunnels and passageways.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump and the British Monarchy", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:What\u2019s most interesting about Ms. North\u2019s analysis of the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d is that she compares Donald Trump not to the British political leader Winston Churchill but to the British monarch Elizabeth II. This is, no doubt, the comparison that Mr. Trump himself would find most appropriate.He has spoken of being \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God has ever created,\u201d revealing his preference to view himself as a divinely ordained ruler rather than a democratically elected leader. He refers to his cabinet picks and advisers as \u201cmy generals,\u201d and to Mike Pence as \u201cone of my very good decisions,\u201d revealing his view of them as servants rather than colleagues.It will not be long before he speaks of us, American citizens, as his subjects; there can be little doubt that he thinks of us that way already.PAMELA J. GRIFFITHBrooklynTo the Editor:Anna North characterizes the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d as a \u201cfantasy\u201d in which ruling a country is rooted essentially not in laws or institutions but in personality. My reading of the series leads me to quite a different view.The focus of \u201cThe Crown\u201d is young Elizabeth, and the arc of the drama portrays the accumulation of personal losses her duty to the crown requires. First, her relationship to her adored husband, Philip, and finally, most wrenching, her rupture with her sister, Margaret, breaking her promise to her father, the late King George VI, that she and her sister hold fast to one another.The final scene of Queen Elizabeth, in full regalia, posing for an official photograph, with Margaret fleeing down a hallway from their final encounter and Philip driving his MG full-bore away from the palace, is heartbreaking.Quite unlike Donald Trump, Elizabeth has learned that the crown is not about her at all, but about tradition and duty and the expectations that history and her nation hold for her.DOROTHY STRANGJamestown, R.I.Advertisement"}
