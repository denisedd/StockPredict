{"Headline": "E.C.B. Extends Bond-Buying Program to Protect Eurozone Economy", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would buy large quantities of bonds and other assets for longer than planned but would cut the size of the purchases, a decision it insisted did not a signal that a much anticipated \u201ctapering\u201d of stimulus measures had begun.\u201cTapering\u201d is a loaded word in financial circles. By buying enormous amounts of bonds in recent months, the European Central Bank has kept market interest rates low, part of efforts to encourage lending and bolster economic growth in the 19-country eurozone. But by reducing its purchases over time, it could limit or reverse this effect.It recalls the so-called taper tantrum in the United States in 2013 after Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that the American central bank would begin reducing its asset purchases. Market turmoil followed as investors sold Treasury bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates.\u201cThere is no question about tapering,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference. \u201cTapering has not been discussed today.\u201dThe response on financial markets showed that investors did not believe Mr. Draghi\u2019s rejection of the word, at least initially.Although the central bank extended the time frame for asset purchases to the end of 2017 from March, investors focused on plans to reduce the asset purchases beginning in April to 60 billion euros, or about $64 billion, from \u20ac80 billion.Markets settled down after Mr. Draghi said that he defined tapering as \u201ca process where purchases would go to zero.\u201d\u201cThat has not been discussed,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is no tapering in sight. The E.C.B. is going to stay in the markets.\u201dEuropean stocks rose and the yields on eurozone government bonds receded after Mr. Draghi offered those reassurances. Analysts who had initially declared the beginning of tapering modified their views.\u201cAt first glance, today\u2019s decisions looked, walked and quacked like tapering,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, chief German economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. \u201cDraghi gave his best to convince everyone that it is not tapering. We tend to believe him.\u201dBelow are other issues that have raised concerns among some economists, investors and central bankers.\u201cUncertainty prevails everywhere.\u201d\u2014 Mario Draghi, warning that despite inflation rising, the eurozone economy is still fragile.Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that inflation would rise next year along with the price of oil. That is allowing the central bank to reduce the size of its asset purchases, which are a form of money printing.But he also suggested the eurozone economy still was a long way from being in good health.Signs of higher inflation have already prompted some economists to press for cuts to the bond buying, which critics say has distorted prices. When the European Central Bank ends the so-called quantitative easing program, they say, the shock to bond prices could destabilize the fragile eurozone economy.The central bank\u2019s \u201cargument in favor of bond purchases no longer holds for 2017,\u201d Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an economic research group in Munich, said in a statement. \u201cThe negative side effects of the E.C.B.\u2019s bond purchases will come to the fore.\u201d\u201cOur view is that easing monetary conditions should help undertaking structural reform.\u201d\u2014 Mr. Draghi, arguing that central bank policies have given political leaders more space to push through changes.As he has for years, Mr. Draghi beseeched leaders of eurozone countries to take steps to help their economies grow faster, warning that the European Central Bank cannot guarantee the health of the common currency area on its own.Resistance to overhauls in Italy, as well as in France, has strengthened the arguments of those who say that European Central Bank support for the eurozone economy has allowed national leaders to procrastinate rather than deal with the region\u2019s problems, such as high government debt or laws that stifle entrepreneurship.Mr. Draghi rejected those arguments on Thursday.\u201cVulnerabilities in the Italian banking system have been there a long time. They will be dealt with.\u201d\u2014 Mr. Draghi, offering restrained assurances that problems facing Italian banks can be solved.If investors demand higher premiums to buy government bonds, the increase in borrowing costs are likely to ripple through credit markets and make it more difficult for businesses in the eurozone to grow.One of the biggest fears in the wake of the Italian vote, and the resignation on Wednesday of the country\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was that political uncertainty would upset plans to pump fresh capital into struggling Italian banks.Mr. Draghi said those banks could be fixed \u2014 the European Central Bank functions as the eurozone\u2019s supreme bank overseer, and it is ultimately responsible for the health of the area\u2019s banking system.But Mr. Draghi also listed all the risks threatening global stability, including Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union and the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States. Mr. Draghi described the president-elect as having a \u201cradical\u201d new view of the world.\u201cI think what central banks can do,\u201d he said, \u201cis keep a steady hand.\u201dAn article on Friday about the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying program misstated the actions taken by investors in 2013 after the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggested that the American central bank would begin reducing asset purchases. Investors sold Treasury bonds; they did not buy them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementDecember  9, 2016Gary LibecapChristine Todd WhitmanDuring the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump heralded the idea of eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. His proposed E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, frequently fought the agency as Oklahoma attorney general. But both may have forgotten that the E.P.A. was created by President Richard Nixon because people were being hospitalized in record numbers during bad air days and rivers were spontaneously combusting due to the dumping of pollutants into our waterways.  If cost-savings is our goal, we must remember that the cost of remediation is far more than prevention. The price we pay for ignoring these issues is much greater than we can afford, both in terms of dollars and human lives. We have seen a glimpse of an increasingly widespread concern for the environment in a number of recent campaigns. The sustained and widespread opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline, which would cross just upstream of the the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s drinking water supply, led the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the project and reconsider its route.While environmental protection may not have been the foremost issue animating Trump\u2019s supporters, it is important to a much larger segment of our population than ever before. Eliminating the E.P.A. altogether would be shortsighted and foolish; we need to take a longer-term view of the affects that our actions toward our surroundings have on our health and our safety \u2013 two resources that once lost cannot simply be repurchased.The American people did not elect Trump and other Republicans because they suddenly all joined the G.O.P., they voted because they wanted a change from politics as usual in Washington. President-elect Trump and congressional leaders should remember that the electorate voted against the hyper-partisanship that has rendered governing at the federal level almost impossible.  The new administration has the opportunity to make a huge difference by recognizing that the environment is not a partisan issue and real, everyday people, genuinely care about their health and quality of life.\nThere is angst in the environmental community about what President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s appointment of Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. administrator means for the agency and environmental policy. The fear is that recent efforts \u2014 ranging from implementing the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone of U.S. compliance with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, to redefining watersheds regulated under the Clean Water Act \u2014 will be rolled back or cancelled.  Broad objectives could be lost.While these two efforts might be critically modified, over all, environmental policies can be more realistic and less controversial under the new administration\u2019s E.P.A. If so, this will be good for the environment and society. Why is that? Environmental policy relies on interest-group politics.  Advocates and opponents provide information to the agency about benefits and costs of proposed programs.  Where interest groups compete, the agency receives balanced appraisals.  When they do not, the agency receives one view. Support for federal environmental policy is strongly associated with income, education, residence and political party \u2014 the same characteristics that statistically explain interest-group effectiveness. Where opponents are unorganized, poorer and lack information on policy proposals, they are less effective in lobbying.  As a result, environmental policies, even when portrayed as providing general public goods, can be favored by a well-organized few, but not by the broader electorate. Moreover the E.P.A. is unlikely to be a disinterested party. Staff identify with expanding their mission and the agency benefits from greater regulatory mandates that increase budgets and staffing.   Mixed political support is compounded by the way environmental policy works.  It primarily uses a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d rule, whereby parties who inflict environmental harm are fined or required to make costly production or consumption adjustments.  While there is a logic for this, the result is that those parties bear the costs of providing a public good. If these costs are high enough and the policies are not as broadly valued as they are by advocates, then environmental regulations are seen as being inequitable and economically damaging to certain constituents.  These parties are motivated to organize, and political push back occurs.  The E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan, for example, imposes direct costs on fossil-fuel producing regions \u2014 their communities, workers and mineral rights owners.  Lower-income consumers nationwide, as well as employees and firm/property owners in energy-intensive industrial areas are harmed.  These groups disproportionately bear the costs of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  A similar skewed distribution of benefits and costs applies to Clean Water Act extensions, where Midwestern farmers will have to pay fees or secure permits to cultivate near peripheral water, depending on \u201cstream\u201d definition under E.P.A. rules.  Again, overall benefits come at a cost to these parties.    It seems clear why both vague general benefits and policy costs and their unequal distributions have made the E.P.A. a flashpoint for many.  Political reaction undermines policy objectives. We have seen this in the response to free trade policies that are nationally beneficial, but inflict harm on certain groups and regions.  If the new E.P.A. changes this distributional dynamic through adoption of \u201cbeneficiary pays\u201d rules and other compensation to those who bear direct costs, the country may achieve more balanced environmental regulation.   \u201cBeneficiary pays\u201d shifts the cost burden to those who value the environmental policy more and hence, leads to a more proportionate distribution of benefits and costs.  Research has shown that these distributions are far more successful in eliciting the support of those who must take action to provide the environmental good.  And when advocates or advocate organizations have to pay, they more carefully weigh benefits and costs in setting objectives, then when the costs are off loaded to others.  Under those circumstances, we are more apt to get the \u201cright\u201d amount of environmental goods through regulation. We have experience with such compensation schemes and positive responses on a small-scale basis in payments to irrigators to fallow land or to line ditches, releasing the water for environmental instream flows. Similar incentive payments are used to pay fishers to reduce fishing to protect fish stocks. These schemes primarily have been used by nongovernmental organizations, such as Environmental Defense, Freshwater Trust and The Nature Conservancy. The new E.P.A. might learn from these experiences and adopt them more generally in devising and implementing policies that are more politically robust and successful in achieving long-term environmental goals.  Will Trump and his new E.P.A. chief have public support if they try to dismantle environmental protections?"}

{"Headline": "For Trump\u2019s Wealthy Cabinet, Prospect of a Sweet Tax Break", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneThere are many dewy-eyed reasons a wealthy and powerful business executive would choose to give up a throne in the private sector and move to Washington for an important government job. There is the chance to give something back to your country through public service, the belief that you have some serious expertise to offer the incoming president and his administration, and a feeling that the country has been on the wrong course and that every American could benefit from some new thinking. Plus, when you get asked to serve the president of the United States, well, you do it.There is another reason that rarely gets discussed: It is the tax benefit of a lifetime.Incoming cabinet officers and senior members of the White House staff have to rid themselves of any potential conflicts of interest before starting their new jobs, and often that means selling investments.That is not as punitive as it sounds. To help a nominee avoid the sometimes negative consequences of quickly unloading stocks or bonds, the tax code contains a provision that allows the securities to be sold and the capital gains tax on such sales deferred if the full proceeds are used to buy Treasuries and certain money-market funds. The tax continues to be deferred until the Treasuries or money-market funds are sold.And if for some reason the individual is really rich and never needs or wants to sell the Treasuries or money-market funds, then the tax owed can be deferred for a very long time, maybe even forever.The idea is to encourage the best and the brightest to serve in government by not penalizing them for having to sell their securities in a hurry or before they otherwise would choose to do so. Seems fair enough. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to defer the tax on any gain related to the sale of stock, especially if the cost basis in the stock is low and the potential tax hit is large? Wouldn\u2019t you jump at the chance to get an extremely valuable present-value tax deferral and to have secretary of state added to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at the same time?At the current long-term capital gains tax rate of 20 percent (for the wealthiest Americans, a category we can stipulate describes Mr. Tillerson), he might have to pay as much as $33 million in taxes, assuming the shares were worth zero when he got them, if the special tax benefit did not exist. With the benefit, he can defer that $33 million tax bill so long as he converts the proceeds of the sale of his Exxon Mobil stock into Treasury securities or money-market funds \u2014 the safest investments out there.True, the yield on these investments is low \u2014 the 30-year Treasury yields around 3.09 percent at the moment \u2014 but that is still $1 million a year that Mr. Tillerson could earn from the $33 million he would not pay in taxes right away. Plus he might never have to pay the capital gains tax on the sale of his Exxon Mobil stock if he never sells the Treasury securities he bought with the proceeds of the sale of his stock.Wait, there is more. Mr. Trump\u2019s choices to head the Treasury and Commerce Departments \u2014 Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur L. Ross Jr. \u2014 are billionaires. Mr. Mnuchin runs a hedge fund; Mr. Ross runs a private equity fund. Divesting themselves of their ownership stakes in the companies or the securities their companies control might be more complicated than simply selling Exxon Mobil or Goldman Sachs stock, but their tax deferral benefit on the sales would be legendary.Among his other holdings, Mr. Mnuchin owns $101 million in stock in CIT, a big financial services company. Selling that stake tax-deferred would allow him to avoid as much as $20 million in taxes. Mr. Ross, 79 years old, is worth $2.5 billion, according to Forbes. His private equity firm invests in energy, financial services, transportation, metals and mining and real estate interests. In addition to choosing him to be commerce secretary, Mr. Trump has offered Mr. Ross the chance to sell whatever securities or equity stakes he still owns on a tax-deferred basis for what probably would be the rest of his life. Thank you, Mr. President-elect!This benefit is not something new for the friends of Mr. Trump. In 2006, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then Goldman\u2019s C.E.O., was tapped to serve as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush and was able to sell his approximately $500 million of Goldman stock on a tax-deferred basis. Mr. Paulson\u2019s timing was propitious. Goldman\u2019s stock hit the skids during the financial crisis two years later.An earlier version of this article misstated Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure at Exxon Mobil.

{"Headline": "After a Year of Faulty Predictions, 3 Approaches to Investing", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersThere is one thing analysts can agree on about the year that is coming to a close: 2016 confounded predictions and expectations. From how stocks would perform to who would win the presidency, this was a bad year for people who tell us what tomorrow will bring.So as people take stock of what has passed and wonder about what\u2019s to come, is there anything to latch on to for guidance? Or is rolling dice just as likely to yield a useful forecast?You will not get any predictions here. Instead you\u2019ll get a look at three reasonable approaches \u2014 call them the 3 C\u2019s \u2014 that investors can take to prepare themselves for next year or any year.The argument here is that a company\u2019s fundamental sales and earnings potential can be analyzed. And while individual investors have been cautious about investing money in the stock market over the last several years, company earnings have continued to be strong.\u201cWith so much negativity out there, you still have to put your money somewhere,\u201d said Thorne Perkin, president of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a theme of U.S. pre-eminence, which we\u2019ve had for years. U.S. equity is the place to be.\u201dSome of the company approach has its basis in how stock markets typically perform. About three-quarters of the time, they go up. And consumers keep buying things.Of course, if there is some external shock \u2014 say, a trade war or a foreign policy crisis \u2014 then it could affect how, when and where companies sell things. And this uncertainty is where the company approach can have pitfalls: What is known now is not everything.\u201cConsumer confidence improved further in December, due solely to increasing expectations, which hit a 13-year high,\u201d Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, which tracks consumer confidence, said in a statement.But there was a caveat: \u201cThe postelection surge in optimism for the economy, jobs and income prospects, as well as for stock prices, which reached a 13-year high, was most pronounced among older consumers.\u201dStew Leonard Jr., president and chief executive of the Stew Leonard\u2019s grocery store chain, which operates in affluent areas of Connecticut and New York, has his own way of measuring the economic sentiment of his customers: He calls it the mashed potato index.Mashed potatoes that are prepared in the store cost about $4 a pound, compared with $1 a pound for potatoes. But with plain old potatoes, you have to peel, cook and mash them yourself.Yet the price disparity between the two is so great \u2014 some 400 percent \u2014 that when Mr. Leonard sees customers buying more prepared mashed potatoes, he stocks the shelves with more high-end food. Customers are feeling flush with cash.\u201cThere isn\u2019t even a close parallel as far as cost goes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s timesaving.\u201dThis holiday season, he said, mashed potato sales were up 31 percent from last year. Catering, he said, was also up 15 percent, and sales of bottles of wine above $20 have also increased since the election.\u201cWe\u2019ve got these things in the store that I rely on a little bit,\u201d Mr. Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t bet the ranch on them, but I keep an eye on them. I really do think they\u2019re a precursor of what\u2019s to come.\u201dYet by the time Donald J. Trump begins his presidency, Mr. Leonard said, his leading indicators will be less reliable. \u201cI can\u2019t really read January or February that well,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is on diets.\u201dThere is one option, however \u2014 particularly after such an unpredictable year \u2014 that all investors can embrace. It\u2019s an approach that allows them to manage the only thing that any investor can control: having a saving, spending and investing plan and adhering to it just as surely when stock prices fall in value as when they rise quickly.As we all know, advice to create a financial plan is akin to recommending a diet after a holiday season of gluttony. Most of us know it\u2019s what we need, but sticking to our resolve beyond the first weeks of the year can prove difficult. (After all, Mr. Leonard knows his consumer indicators revert to the mean after the dieting months of January and February are over.)But several advisers have suggestions on how to keep people sticking to their plans. One of them is thinking negatively about the year.\u201cIf I had had a crystal ball, and it said the U.K. would vote to leave the E.U. and that Trump would win the election, it would have never occurred to any of us that the response would have been a really ebullient stock market,\u201d said Seth Masters, chief investment officer of Bernstein, which manages portfolios for AllianceBernstein\u2019s private client group. \u201cSo what you need to do is have some thoughtful risk management and predict all the ways you think you can be wrong.\u201dSounds like a depressing way to begin a new year, but Mr. Masters explains that concentrating on potential risks is one way to get investors to stick to the long-term plans they created.He said the plans that the firm set up for clients before the 2008 crisis had accounted for the risk of a recession like the one the United States went through. The plans did not place a high probability on such a collapse, but they did chart a course through it.\u201cWe spent a lot of time speaking to clients that there could be a lot of bumps in the road, and that the only way a plan could work is if you stuck to it even when things were terrible,\u201d Mr. Masters said.Of course, during the crisis many investors panicked just as assets were at their lowest. \u201cThe industry may have been putting plans together, but the evidence is pretty damning,\u201d Mr. Masters said. \u201cAt every dip, there have been huge outflows into bonds from equities at the exact wrong time, and then money back into stocks at the wrong time.\u201dWhat\u2019s the solution? Instead of panicking, investors should rebalance their portfolios \u2014 meaning that they should adhere to the allocations set out in their plan. This goes for good times, too, when people are more likely to let positive returns knock their portfolios out of balance.\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many people come in, and they create a plan and then they take it home and never touch it again,\u201d said Darrell L. Cronk, president of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cKeeping it alive, changing it, adjusting it as the return structure changes \u2014 we plot a line to make sure people are staying on that plan.\u201d\u201cThere are no epiphanies,\u201d he added. \u201cDiscipline, discipline, discipline is going to get you a lot farther down the path when emotions ride high and you most want to make those decisions\u201d that deviate from the plan.While this sounds a lot more boring than telling people to buy a certain stock or bet the farm on a commodity, focusing energy on a plan is going to get people a lot closer to their goals in 2017 and beyond.Besides, as Mr. Masters said, \u201cNo one will have the right list of surprises for you, and if they did, you\u2019d think they were nuts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nine out of 10 Wall Street research analysts recommended that investors hold it in their portfolio, if not buy more.That same month, however, a different type of research firm downgraded Pfizer to its lowest rating, reflecting what it considered increased risks from factors that other Wall Street analysts typically ignore: environmental, social and corporate governance issues, or E.S.G.Investing based on so-called E.S.G. factors has mushroomed in recent years, driven in part by big pension funds and European money managers that are trying new ways to evaluate potential investments. The idea has changed over the last three decades from managers\u2019 simple exclusion from their portfolios of \u201csin stocks\u201d such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms makers to incorporation of E.S.G. analysis into their stock and bond picks.MSCI is perhaps better known for its global stock indexes, but its annual E.S.G. index and research revenues have been growing at 20 percent annually and should top $44 million this year, making the segment the firm\u2019s fastest-growing business.On Pfizer, MSCI\u2019s research noted the high volume of regulatory warnings that the company had received as of mid-2015, raising the risk of liability concerning five of its drugs. The downgrade caught Pfizer\u2019s attention, and its representatives met with MSCI officials to update them on legal issues like asbestos lawsuits, and about various drugs like Zoloft, Effexor and Protonix. MSCI kept its rating.The amount of assets managed using E.S.G. factors has more than tripled to $8.1 trillion since 2010, according to a report issued in November by the US SIF Foundation, which tracks sustainable investing. The TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund has doubled in size to a current $2.3 billion in the last five years. Exchange-traded funds linked to MSCI E.S.G. indexes have tripled to $3 billion in the last three years. And there has been a proliferation of E.S.G. index or research providers, including FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices and Sustainalytics, which helps Morningstar rate mutual funds on their E.S.G. factors.Surveys have shown that younger investors like the approach. Calls for fossil-fuel divestment linked to climate-change concerns have also raised awareness. Even the regulatory climate has shifted: The Department of Labor ruled last year that investing fiduciaries could consider E.S.G. factors in their investment decisions as long as they did not hurt expected returns.Lisa Woll, chief executive of US SIF, said that even if a Trump administration \u201crolls back progress\u201d on some environmental and social issues, the field over all \u201cis likely to continue to grow based on demand by a wide range of investors.\u201dAssembled through acquisitions between 2009 and 2014, the MSCI E.S.G. ratings \u201chave come to be the market standard for E.S.G.,\u201d said Amy Orr, the director of capital markets at the Heron Foundation, which pursues an anti-poverty mission.On a recent morning last month, standing before a computer screen elevated by black metal stilts for videoconferencing, Ms. Lee conducted calls with MSCI analysts in Mumbai, Tokyo, Beijing and Massachusetts to consider a few possible ratings changes.They first considered whether a Chinese steel company, Fosun International, should be upgraded because it was moving into financial services and would have lower exposure to toxic emissions. \u201cWe approve, including the rating upgrade. Thanks, Xiaoshu,\u201d Ms. Lee said to her analyst.Next was a downgrade of ENN Energy Holdings, a natural gas pipeline distributor in China that had carbon emission issues and what a utility analyst in Tokyo, Kenji Watanabe, called a \u201cweak board composition.\u201d But a downgrade was deferred for Bollor\u00e9 S.A. \u2014 a French transportation company that recently had a rail accident that killed 79 in Cameroon \u2014 pending an MSCI effort to reach the company.The MSCI ratings do not exclude all stocks in any given category, such as fossil fuels or tobacco, but rather rank each company against its peers based on how it manages E.S.G. risks.In oil and gas, for example, the Norwegian giant Statoil ranks near the top based partly on its record of spills and low emissions, while the American company Chevron ranks near the bottom with higher-risk operations, including forced shutdowns this year of a new $54 billion liquefied natural gas plant in Australia.The building blocks for MSCI\u2019s E.S.G. research came from acquisitions that included a governance ratings firm co-founded by Robert Monks, a pioneer in shareholder activism, and a socially responsible stock research firm, KLD Research & Analytics, which introduced the Domini 400 Social Index in 1990.The goal, Mr. Monks said in a recent interview, is to \u201capply something akin to classical security analysis to areas which have so far escaped consideration in valuing companies.\u201dPerformance does not have to suffer. Although the TIAA-CREF social choice fund and the flagship MSCI exchange-traded fund have trailed the market slightly for the last five years, the Vanguard fund has topped it. The $14.8 billion Parnassus Core Equity Investor fund, which picks stocks using E.S.G. and fundamental analysis, has beaten the market by more than two percentage points annually over the last 10 years.As E.S.G. becomes more popular, companies have become more responsive to MSCI\u2019s data-gathering efforts. Ms. Lee said the response rate had risen from about 15 percent in 2013 to a current 40 percent. Pfizer, for example, first got in touch with MSCI in 2014.The TIAA-CREF social choice fund, which aims to invest in E.S.G. leaders, does not hold several well-known stocks based partly on unfavorable MSCI ratings. Among those excluded are Exxon Mobil (for environmental impact management), Apple (labor-management relations and supply chain issues), Facebook (privacy and data security), Amazon (labor-management practices), and General Electric (labor-management practices, military contracting, weapons).With undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard, Ms. Lee came to MSCI through the 2010 acquisition of RiskMetrics Group, owner of the Innovest sustainability research firm. Operating from a 48th-floor glass-walled aerie opposite One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, she oversees 150 analysts who follow 6,500 companies in 14 offices worldwide.Some investors find data from MSCI and others helpful as a starting point beyond the narrower E.S.G. agenda. \u201cIt really helps us quickly understand whether there are business controversies or other risks \u2014 and opportunities,\u201d said Karina Funk, a co-manager of the $360 million Brown Advisory Sustainable Growth fund.For example, she said, her firm bought stock in American Tower, a cellular tower company, after Brown\u2019s own research found its tower-siting practices exceed standards set by environmental regulators or wildlife management groups, \u201cmaking them a preferred partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The industry as a whole has paid tens of billions of dollars to resolve claims over the sale of those securities.Credit Suisse said the settlement related to business primarily conducted from 2005 to 2007.Concerns about potentially large civil penalties in the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry have weighed on the stocks of some European lenders.Deutsche Bank, in particular, had been under pressure in recent months after it said in September that the United States government was seeking up to $14 billion in the inquiry.Credit Suisse said it would take a pretax charge in the fourth quarter of about $2 billion, in addition to its existing reserves for the mortgage inquiry, to fund the settlement.The Obama administration has used legislation that stemmed from the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s as a means to pursue cases stemming from the financial crisis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Contrarian\u2019s View on Inflation Fears", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewAs the United States economy braces itself for the presidency of Donald J. Trump, many have been quick to point out that the policies of the incoming administration may have the unintended consequence of fueling inflation.They argue that the prospect of a large fiscal stimulus as the economy is approaching full employment may create shortages in the labor market. Additionally, substantial infrastructure spending could spark a rally in commodity prices, lifting the cost of producing manufactured goods.The Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec. 14 reinforced the inflation fear, and cited the strengthening labor market and inflation as it increased the federal funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to between 0.50 and 0.75 percent. Of course the Fed should be alert to threats to price stability. But the current concerns could very well be overdone.Already, markets around the world have reacted to the prospect of these policies. But the sharp rise in the exchange value of the dollar along with a marked increase in bond yields is hardly the backdrop associated with rising inflation in the United States. While many market participants point to the sharp increase in interest rates as evidence of rising inflationary expectations, that does not square with a stronger dollar and lower prices in precious metals and relatively stable energy markets. The Fed announcement of three expected rate increases in 2017 is a more aggressive stance from the central bank, which should serve to further strengthen the dollar.Contrast that with Britain, where the pound\u2019s sharp depreciation after June\u2019s Brexit vote has revived inflation, which hit a two-year high in November.An examination of a similar period in American history when United States policy resulted in large fiscal stimulus through military spending and tax cuts, along with lighter regulation, shows that supply side shocks are not necessarily inflationary. The Reagan revolution of the early 1980s resulted in a stronger dollar and a meaningful, if not painful, decline in precious metals and energy prices. Inflationary pressures waned in the years subsequent to the 1980 election, even as monetary policy became increasingly accommodative.While it would be foolhardy to say history will repeat itself, I am reminded of the quip that it often rhymes.Experience plainly shows that fiscal stimulus, especially when monetary policy is on a more restrictive path, results in higher real rates of interest and a stronger currency. Higher real rates help to tamp down inflation while a stronger dollar reduces import prices.No one should be surprised that markets are already adjusting to reflect a stronger domestic economy, but this does not necessarily lead to higher core or headline inflation. As a matter of fact, the recent market moves have already primed the pipeline with disinflationary forces that will greet the new administration.The incoming administration\u2019s focus on deregulation and support for domestic energy production strengthens the argument against a sudden surge in prices.Wages will probably be a different story. As the economy approaches full employment, wage pressures are expected to mount. Tax cuts, infrastructure spending, deregulation and support for domestic energy production all point to a powerful fiscal elixir which will increase demand for labor and encourage increased consumption.Americans and the world should welcome a surge in wage growth. Income inequality in the United States has become as pronounced as at any time since the Gilded Age. Political and social instability is challenging policy makers as populist uprisings spread from one region to another.As wages rise, consumer prices are likely to remain restrained. The resulting increase in real earnings along with increased job availability should foster an environment which encourages public confidence in political institutions by reducing economic inequality across classes and creating more opportunities for all.There are many who would have preferred a different path. Some of their concerns are well founded. Policies that result in trade wars or mass deportations would undermine the success of a Trump economic revolution. These policies would not only create severe headwinds to growth but could result in recession or worse. These pitfalls must be avoided.If the Trump economic plan is successfully carried out, the Fed is likely to find itself raising rates more rapidly than the market is currently expecting, not because inflation is rising but because the natural rate of interest is rising in line with higher potential output.As the Fed moves to adjust for faster growth, shorter-maturity Treasurys will be more vulnerable to further price declines while the risk of a sudden spike in inflation will diminish. Bond yields are not rising because of increasing inflationary expectations; they are rising because of an increase in anticipation of real growth. Given that inflationary fears are overblown, longer-term bond yields are probably close to their highs for this cycle, and the environment will remain positive for riskier assets like high-yield bonds, bank loans and stocks.Scott Minerd is chairman of investments and global chief investment officer for Guggenheim Partners.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Employee Pension Will Consider Cutting Return Assumption", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCalpers may be getting a bit more real. The $300 billion California public employees\u2019 pension manager is considering cutting its investment return assumption. The move would squeeze the budgets of public authorities and employees, but secure funding for retirees. If the American government pension bellwether can do it, others will follow.Public pension funds in the United States have long relied on unrealistic investment assumptions, but the financial crisis and lackluster market performance have exposed that game. Calpers took a small step in 2012 by lowering its return assumption by 0.25 percentage point, to 7.5 percent, but the fund generated a return of just 0.61 percent in the 12 months that ended June 30. Annualized returns were 5.1 percent over the last 10 years.Ted Eliopoulos, the chief investment officer, has overhauled the fund\u2019s portfolio since taking over two years ago, slashing the hedge fund allocation and awarding fewer, but bigger, mandates to outside managers. Those moves are not sufficient to close the gap for a retirement system that has only 76 percent of the assets needed to ensure current retirement benefits to its members.The Calpers board will next week consider a plan to reduce the return assumption to as low as 7 percent. The cost to employers would be phased in over five years, with the pension contributions of state and local governments rising by as much as $2 billion a year in the fifth year. For employees, the hit could be another percentage point or more in payroll deductions.That is a political red flag, and the postelection stock market surge might tempt some pension trustees to duck. But the Trump bump will not solve their problem. Stocks could easily give up recent gains, and higher interest rates will hit bond returns in the short run. Wilshire, the consultant, forecasts that a classic 60-40 stock-to-bond portfolio will return less than 6 percent a year.Private sector defined-benefit pension plans typically use return assumptions of 4.25 percent at the moment, according to Milliman, another consulting firm. The well-funded pension system in the Netherlands is even more demanding, assuming gains of less than 3.5 percent a year.If Calpers does bite the bullet now, that would improve its own position and send a useful signal. Many American public pensions have worse funding situations and even more optimistic assumptions. It is past time to stop pretending.An earlier version of this column misstated the timing of a Calpers plan to revise its investment return assumption. The five-year phase-in period applies to the cost to employers, not to the new return assumption itself, which would take effect immediately.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank to Settle Mortgage Inquiry for $7.2 Billion", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byDeutsche Bank announced late on Thursday that it had reached a tentative $7.2 billion deal to resolve a federal investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage securities, capping months of negotiations that weighed heavily on the bank\u2019s stock price and reputation.Still, the bank cautioned that the deal was not final, saying that \u201cthere can be no assurance that the U.S. Department of Justice and the bank will agree on the final documentation.\u201dThe payout would settle claims that the bank, like many other institutions during the financial crisis of 2008, sold investors mortgage securities that contributed to the crisis. Collectively, big banks have paid tens of billions of dollars over their sale of these securities.The settlement for Deutsche Bank, abrupt as it was, comes after many months of uncertainty that cast a pall over the bank\u2019s future after reports last fall that the government had asked the bank to pay $14 billion as negotiations got underway.That such an enormous number was even mentioned raised concerns not just about the bank\u2019s business model in the years ahead, but its short-term prospects as well.This deal, while substantial, falls far short of that sum.From the summer of 2015 to last summer, Deutsche\u2019s stock more than halved, hitting a low of $11, as fears over the bank\u2019s future mounted, prompting some hedge funds to withdraw cash they were holding at the bank.Since early November, however, shares of Deutsche Bank have taken part in a broad rally of bank stocks, on hopes that the election of Donald J. Trump, a longtime and substantial client of the bank, would mean a dialing back of bank regulations in the United States. The German bank has substantial operations in New York, as well as in London and Frankfurt.Problems with Deutsche Bank manipulating core lending and foreign exchange rates, pushing toxic mortgages, helping hedge funds lessen their tax bills and failing to put in place proper risk controls have persistently infuriated regulators. But not only the watchdogs were upset.Ultimately the bank\u2019s shareholders supported a business model based on paying extremely large sums to some of the most brazen risk-takers Wall Street had ever produced.According to calculations by Berenberg Bank, since 1995, when Deutsche Bank\u2019s global markets division was first set up, the bank has paid out 65 billion euros, about $68 billion, in bonuses.During this same period, the bank\u2019s board in Frankfurt asked investors to come up with \u20ac23 billion to bolster its perpetually thin cushion of cash.\u201cMoney went everywhere, except to the shareholders,\u201d said Bernd Ondruch of Astellon Capital Partners, a hedge fund based in London. \u201cDeutsche had to pay its way into investment banking, and during the boom years, the bankers took the balance sheet hostage. This was an issue for all the banks but Deutsche Bank was the most aggressive by far.\u201dThese outsize numbers highlight the herculean task before Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, who, has been trying to reinvent the bank and move it beyond its legal problems.It is a strategy that virtually all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s peers have been following, and many of them are already years into a turnaround effort.And unlike peer institutions like Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup, Deutsche Bank cannot fall back on a dominant deposit-taking brand as it tries to move away from its reliance on trading activities.Germany\u2019s banking market remains highly fragmented, and attempts by Deutsche Bank to build its domestic franchise via the purchase of the retail lender Postbank and merger talks with Commerzbank have not been successful.In recent weeks, Deutsche Bank, as part of its broader restructuring efforts, has cut ties with 3,400 trading clients, an extraordinary move for an institution that over a 20-year span has made its name by servicing sophisticated investors in London, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Calpers Cuts Investment Targets, Increasing Strain on Municipalities", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byThe board of California\u2019s state public pension system, Calpers, voted Wednesday to lower expectations for future investment returns, a step that will increase pressure on the budgets of towns and cities across the state.Calpers, a giant with roughly $300 billion in assets, has long been a bellwether among America\u2019s thousands of public pension funds because of its sheer size and influence in the investment industry. It manages the investments for more than 1.7 million current and future retirees, making it the nation\u2019s largest public fund outside the federal government. Calpers\u2019 move to lower its investment expectations is likely to prompt pension systems in other states to do the same.\u201cThis is very monumental for the organization,\u201d one trustee, Richard Costigan, said at a public meeting just before the vote.With the move, Calpers is changing its business plan, so that investment returns will cover less of the cost of retirees\u2019 pensions than previously. That will force local governments to pay more, either through higher taxes or reduced public services. Public workers in California will have to chip in more, too.At the same time, the move has little chance of satisfying critics of public pension systems who have argued for years that the sector\u2019s methodology is dangerously flawed \u2014 not just because many investment projections are overly optimistic, but also because pension plans use those projections to calculate their liabilities, violating basic economic principles.Such critics, many of them economists, say that because public pensions are virtually risk-free for recipients, their values should be based on the returns of safe investments like Treasury securities, which have recently hovered around 2.5 percent for 10-year bonds. Calpers now uses Treasury rates only when a city wants to drop out of its system.Under all other circumstances, Calpers currently assumes that its investment portfolio will return an average of 7.5 percent a year over the long term, and bills its member governments accordingly. Its trustees agreed Wednesday to reduce that to 7 percent, phasing in the reduction over the next three years.The differences may sound small, but just a slight reduction in the assumed rate drives up the cost sharply, because it is multiplied across decades and for thousands of retirees.Shifting expectations down to 7 percent will force the State of California to contribute an additional $2 billion a year for state workers, according to Eric Stern, a policy adviser for the California Department of Finance who briefed Calpers board members about the measure on Tuesday.All public pension funds pool money and invest it in the hope that returns will cover most of the cost of retirees\u2019 benefits. But those costs are rising quickly now, as the baby boom generation retires, and investment returns have not nearly kept pace.Even before the change takes effect, some cities in California have complained that their pension plans are too costly. Calpers bills them once a year for their share, assuming the investments will return 7.5 percent in the future. Calpers confirmed in a recent risk report that for some types of pensions \u2014 especially those for police \u2014 those bills are higher than ever before.Some local governments say they simply cannot keep up, yet they are not allowed an easy exit from the system. Pensions thus played a prominent role in the municipal bankruptcies of Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino, with Calpers arguing that the cities could not lower their pension contributions or switch to less costly plans, even though companies routinely do so in bankruptcy. Those arguments prompted the judge in Stockton\u2019s bankruptcy case, Christopher Klein, to call Calpers \u201ca bully\u201d with \u201can iron fist.\u201dMarcia Fritz, president of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility, said the additional pension costs might push more local governments over a fiscal cliff.\u201cThe ones that are hurting the most are the small, non-volunteer fire districts in rural areas,\u201d Ms. Fritz said.They lack a tax base big enough to cover the substantial cost of keeping firefighters on duty around the clock, she said. Some have been experimenting with other revenue sources but have not found a permanent fix, and rising pension costs could be their death knell.Despite those concerns, Calpers board members decided they had no choice but to lower investment expectations. Outside advisers have been urging the system to do so for years. Its chief investment officer, Ted Eliopoulos, said last summer that investment returns for the previous year were close to zero, and that it would be a big challenge for Calpers to get through the next three to five years.With rising numbers of retirees drawing their benefits, Mr. Eliopoulos said this week that he had been scaling back the risk level in Calpers\u2019 investment portfolio. Stocks \u2014 both domestic and global \u2014 had been reduced to 46 percent of the investment portfolio from 51 percent, for example.Lowering risk, however, generally means lower returns as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Surge Presents Risks for the Trump Administration", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewThe \u201cbig, fat, ugly bubble\u201d in the stock market that President-elect Donald J. Trump so astutely identified during his campaign now becomes one of the greatest potential liabilities of his presidency.If that bubble bursts soon, the pain will correctly be understood to be the result of monetary manipulations during the Obama years. But if it persists and the United States economy manages to further postpone its long-overdue recession (following an expansion that was barely that), Mr. Trump\u2019s ostensibly \u201cfree-market\u201d policies will unfairly bear the blame when the markets finally do return to reality \u2014 perhaps a year or two down the road.The postelection Trump rally in the stock market is evidence of euphoric optimism about the fiscal stimulus, reduced regulations and lower taxes that are hoped for. And yet we mustn\u2019t forget where we are today, with distorted pricing in virtually all markets and extremely levered public and private balance sheets, all driven by monetary interventionism on a scale never seen before: By most measures, the stock market is as expensive as it has been for a century, save only the giddy late 1990s.The challenge, therefore, is for the incoming administration to let the authorities own the initial pain that is sure to come, such as the pain of pulling off the bandages, while letting the later recovery be his \u2014 as it should be. Though the Obama administration was able to blame a previous administration\u2019s presumed free-market policies for eight years of lackluster recovery, it will be much harder for Mr. Trump to transfer blame for any economic crisis that occurs on his watch.There\u2019s something about a government that steps back to let free markets fix themselves that invariably renders it a ripe target for blame. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have done something?\u201dAfter all, if the rally following his surprise election bears Mr. Trump\u2019s name, the danger is that so, too, will the inevitable correction that neither he nor the Fed can stop. What could result \u2014 and what we should all fear, specifically \u2014 is the political pendulum swinging violently back toward big government and even greater market interventionism.If Mr. Trump can focus on the long term and encourage asset prices and investments to correct themselves early (to the extent that he even holds such sway over them), perhaps this controlled experiment can remain obvious to everyone. Worthy or not, as the current general for advocates of the free market, he should hope to lose the short-term battle to win the bigger war, to gain positional advantage for the looming contest ahead.Mark Spitznagel is the founder and chief investment officer of Universa Investments, and is a former senior economic adviser to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

{"Headline": "Wall Street\u2019s Annual Stock Forecasts: Bullish, and Often Wrong", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byStrategiesDon\u2019t expect Wall Street investment houses to predict a stock market decline in 2017. That\u2019s just not what they usually do.Instead, they engage in an annual ritual that is underway right now: Every December as the holidays approach, Wall Street gurus examine the stock market, and nearly all declare that stocks will rise in the forthcoming calendar year.The forecasts are still coming in for 2017, but preliminary tallies suggest that \u2014 no surprise \u2014 strategists are bullish, probably mildly so. Through last year, since 2000, the consensus has always been bullish, holding that the market would rise, on average, about 9.5 percent a year, according to calculations by Bespoke Investment Group. In reality, it rose only 3.9 percent a year, on average, in that period.So the cheery predictions have often been wrong. Does it really matter? After all, the stock market actually rises most of the time.Bullish predictions encourage investors to pour fresh money into the markets, helping asset management companies to enjoy rising profits. Even if returns don\u2019t match the expectations set by forecasters, memories are short and money is being made.But here\u2019s the rub: The stock market sometimes falls, and from time to time, it absolutely tanks. Since the start of 2000, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has ended in negative territory in five calendar years (2000, 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2015) and has been virtually flat once (in 2011). But while a handful of individual forecasters have, from time to time, predicted mildly negative years for stocks, the Wall Street consensus in every single year since 2000 has predicted a rising market.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be as bad as they are,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey are much worse than random chance alone would predict.\u201d (Mr. Mehta was formerly the director of research and analytics for the United States Treasury\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program and for the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.)After examining forecasts by major investment houses going back to 1998, Mr. Mehta found that 8 percent of individual analyst predictions called for a small market decline in subsequent years. But those predictions of decline were worse than random: In the years when the market did fall, 9 percent of forecasts \u2014 never enough to counter the bullish consensus \u2014 predicted that it would happen, essentially the same as in a year in which the market rose.Yet, as Mr. Mehta found, the typical negative individual forecast only called for a 5 percent decline, so the size of forecast errors, like the 49-percentage-point error of 2008, was larger than would be expected from mere chance. On a statistical basis, the forecasters were \u201cactively adding negative value\u201d \u2014 essentially destroying value by issuing spurious numbers.If I were to simply program my computer to predict a market increase of, say 5 percent each calendar year, without fail, Mr. Mehta said, my forecasts would be better than the consensus version \u2014 which is to say, they would be lacking in value. The forecasts are worse than that.Oddly, 2016 is likely to look like a reasonably good year for the consensus forecasts, which last December called for the S.&P. 500 to end 2016 a little above 2200. That is where the market is hovering now. But even this year is no time for gloating: Early in 2016, the market declined sharply and forecasters shifted their predictions lower. Then they adjusted upward after the market rebounded. The consensus forecast this year looks good only if you rely on the December version and discard the other two.Individual forecasts sometimes swing widely yet remain way off the mark. In December 2015, for example, Federated Investors predicted that the S.&P. 500 would rise 18.2 percent this year. By February, it sharply downshifted, forecasting a net loss of 10.5 percent. But facing a rising market, by September, it became mildly bullish, predicting a net 2.7 percent gain in 2016. So far, the first estimate seems to be the best one: On Friday, the stock market was up more than 10 percent for the calendar year.Part of the problem is that calendar years are arbitrary periods when it comes to the markets, which are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to time accurately and consistently. Will the market rise 6 percent in the next 12 months? No one knows.While such forecasts are fruitless, there are others that are less precisely timed, more nuanced and sometimes worth pondering.But Mr. Masters looked at the relatively low stock market prices and at the extremely low level of interest rates engendered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and concluded that the probability of a long-term increase in stock values was very high. That wasn\u2019t a very controversial conclusion. But it contained a message: He was urging investors to take a little risk and hold stocks for the long run. The market is trading very close to 20,000 now, and I spoke to him again last week.\u201cIf anything, we weren\u2019t bullish enough then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said it would probably happen by 2022, and we are already there.\u201dMr. Masters was sheepish about making even that forecast, pointing out that he doesn\u2019t issue annual calendar year predictions. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that accurately,\u201d he said.His outlook is less bullish now. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had a great bull market,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to keep happening. At this point, I\u2019d predict that we will cross Dow 20,000 many times: The market won\u2019t just go up from here.\u201dStock prices have surged since the election and are much higher than they were in 2012, interest rates are rising, and political uncertainty is mounting. He said that the greatest likelihood over the next five or 10 years is that stock returns will be lower than they have been lately, and that bond returns will be constrained too.\u201cIt may be a more difficult time for investors,\u201d Mr. Masters said. But he wouldn\u2019t issue stock market price targets. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes sense to do that very often,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is too complex for that. We can analyze trends, we can give some probabilities \u2014 we can\u2019t really predict the future.\u201dTwitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Rev Up the Economy? Don\u2019t Worry About the Trade Deficit", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe economic policy of President-elect Donald J. Trump is still a work in progress. But if campaign rhetoric is a reliable guide, reorienting trade policy may become one of the main goals of the new administration.That conclusion is correct, but only in a superficial sense. Gross domestic product is, by definition, the sum of consumption spending, investment spending, government purchases and the net exports of goods and services. If net exports rose from their current negative value to zero, and the other three components stayed the same, domestic production would increase and, consequently, so should employment.But a fuller look at the macroeconomic effects of trade deficits suggests that things aren\u2019t so simple.The most important lesson about trade deficits is that they have a flip side. When the United States buys goods and services from other nations, the money Americans send abroad generally comes back in one way or another. One possibility is that foreigners use it to buy things we produce, and we have balanced trade. The other possibility, which is relevant when we have trade deficits, is that foreigners spend on capital assets in the United States, such as stocks, bonds and direct investments in plants, equipment and real estate.The trade deficit is inextricably linked to this capital inflow. When foreigners decide to move their assets into the United States, they have to convert their local currencies into American dollars. As they supply foreign currency and demand dollars in the markets for currency exchange, they cause the dollar to appreciate. A stronger dollar makes American exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which in turn pushes the trade balance toward deficit.From this perspective, many of the policies proposed by Mr. Trump will increase the trade deficit rather than reduce it. He has proposed scaling back both burdensome business regulations and taxes on corporate and other business income. His tax cuts and infrastructure spending will most likely increase the government\u2019s budget deficit, which tends to increase interest rates. These changes should attract even more international capital into the United States, leading to an even stronger dollar and larger trade deficits.But what about those tariffs that Mr. Trump sometimes threatens to impose on foreign countries? They would certainly curtail the amount of international trade, but they are unlikely to have a large impact on the trade deficit.When American consumers facing higher import prices from tariffs stop buying certain products from abroad, they will supply fewer dollars in foreign-exchange markets. The smaller supply of dollars will drive the value of the dollar further upward. This dollar appreciation offsets some of the effects of the tariff on imports, and it makes American exports less competitive in world markets.But it doesn\u2019t matter much, anyway, because in reality, trade deficits are not a threat to robust growth and full employment. The United States had a large trade deficit in 2009, when the unemployment rate reached 10 percent, but it had an even larger trade deficit in 2006, when the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent.Rather than reflecting the failure of American economic policy, the trade deficit may be better viewed as a sign of success. The relative vibrancy and safety of the American economy is why so many investors around the world want to move their assets here. (And similarly, it is why so many workers want to immigrate here.)Mr. Trump says he wants to restore more rapid economic growth. That is a sensible goal. But focusing on the trade deficit is not the best way to achieve it.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Market and the \u2018Trump Effect\u2019: What Do the Tea Leaves Say?", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseSo much for the \u201cJanuary barometer.\u201dDuring the first five trading days of this year, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 6 percent, the worst start to a new year ever for investors.For all of January, it dropped 5.5 percent, the worst January since 2009 and the depths of the financial crisis.For followers of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac and others who look for patterns in the stock market, those were resounding portents of financial doom.\u201cAs January goes, so goes the entire market year,\u201d is one of the best-known aphorisms from the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, an annual compilation of dates, statistics and advice for investors that was first published in 1968 by Yale Hirsch.Moreover, in presidential election years, the almanac posits that the market\u2019s performance during the first five days of trading will determine if the market ends up or down for the year.But after a major postelection rally, the market was a hair\u2019s breadth away from the milestone of 20,000 on the Dow, and the S.&P. 500-stock index and Nasdaq were also setting records. The Dow was up 12 percent for the year, the S.&P. 500 was up in excess of 9 percent, and the Nasdaq gained nearly 8 percent.No barometer, of course, is always right. But over the last 10 years, the January barometer gave false negative indications in 2014, 2010 and 2009, and a false positive in 2011. With its spectacular failure this year, it has been right just 50 percent of the time over the last decade \u2014 which means it is essentially worthless as a predictor.Jeff Hirsch, Yale Hirsch\u2019s son and now editor and publisher of the almanac, acknowledged this week that both barometers had missed the mark this year, but said their long-term record remained intact and that they had accurately anticipated the correction that bottomed out in February. In any event, he has never said that investors should rely solely on the almanac\u2019s predictions in making investment decisions.Human nature being what it is, that\u2019s not likely to stop investors from searching for predictive patterns, such as the relationship between stock performance and presidential elections, which has produced a bullish signal this year.The almanac points out that during the years of a Republican president and a Republican majority in both the House and Senate, the S.&P. 500 has risen on average 14.1 percent. (The market\u2019s track record for a Democratic president and Republican House and Senate is even better at 16.4 percent, on average.)We\u2019re now in the midst of what some are calling the \u201cTrump effect,\u201d which posits that stocks are poised to soar even more, not just because of historical patterns, but thanks to a new business- and investor-friendly Trump administration.\u201cIf this guy pulls it together and really creates some change, if we see some political functionality and he pushes some constructive things through despite his rants and diatribes, we could be at the start of a superboom cycle,\u201d Mr. Hirsch told me. Then again, he continued, \u201cif he fumbles this, then all bets are off.\u201dBelievers in the Trump effect have gained confidence from the powerful market rally that kicked in after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory.This week I asked James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, to compare the market\u2019s performance during the 34 days since the election with every other election year going back to 1928. He told me the postelection rise in the S.&P. 500 of 5.5 percent through Monday was the best ever.But whether further gains are ahead is an open question. Mr. Stack pointed out that all presidential election correlations are of dubious predictive validity because the database is too small; from 1916 through Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November, there have been just 26 presidential elections over the last 100 years.In heavily blue places (like Manhattan), there\u2019s an entirely different Trump effect: the belief he\u2019s about to take the economy over a cliff. Investors who support that idea should dump stocks and retreat to the safety of government bonds \u2014 though the safety of even those may be suspect, given Mr. Trump\u2019s past threat to renege on the national debt.This camp, too, can point to historical precedent. After the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, the S.&P. 500 ran up 9.2 percent by the end of November, the biggest, fastest postpresidential election gain ever. The honeymoon didn\u2019t last long: We all know what happened in 1929.Mr. Trump himself has emerged as a bearish stock market prognosticator, declaring during the first presidential debate in September, \u201cWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.\u201d If so, it has only gotten fatter since.To help navigate these conflicting signals, I turned to Burton Malkiel, emeritus professor of economics at Princeton and author of the classic \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investment.\u201dMr. Malkiel\u2019s advocacy of the efficient market theory, his many years as a director of the mutual fund giant Vanguard, and his current position as chief investment officer for the automated investment firm Wealthfront have all contributed to the rise of so-called passive investing.\u201cThe problem with all these data people is that you can find correlations anywhere,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cMy favorite is milk production in Bangladesh,\u201d which, according to one academic study, explains 99 percent of movements in the S.&P. 500. \u201cIt\u2019s true the stock market has done better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones,\u201d he said. \u201cBut is that just a spurious correlation? In all likelihood, it is.\u201d\u201cI hear all the time that the market has gone crazy since the election,\u201d Mr. Malkiel continued. \u201cIs the market too high now? I have no idea, and neither does anyone else. I\u2019ve been around a long time. One thing I can tell you for sure is that nobody, and I mean nobody, can consistently time the market.\u201dAt the same time, he doesn\u2019t consider it irrational that the market has surged since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\u201cPeople who think Trump is going to take us over a cliff don\u2019t have any superior knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll do something really stupid on trade and the economy will go over a cliff. It\u2019s a possibility. But it\u2019s also a possibility that we\u2019re going to have stronger economic growth. My own view is that we\u2019re going to have better real growth in 2017 than 2016, maybe not 4 percent, but 3 percent, absolutely. It\u2019s not completely nonsensical for the market to be up.\u201dSo what should investors \u2014 of whatever political leanings \u2014 do now?Mr. Stack said he was telling clients to be cautious, not because of any views about a Trump presidency, but because valuations are getting stretched and the bull market is now the second-longest in the last 85 years.\u201cThat makes me nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned over 40 years of investing is that profit opportunities always come around if you\u2019re patient. Don\u2019t be lured in because you\u2019re afraid the Dow is going through 20,000 and you\u2019ll be left behind. There is no last train out of the station.\u201dMr. Malkiel urged investors to ignore their feelings about a Trump presidency. \u201cWhether you think Trump will be wildly successful or he\u2019ll be a disaster, don\u2019t try to move in or out of assets because you think you know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Malkiel advised. He said investors should be broadly diversified, stick to their asset allocation plans and rebalance periodically. \u201cAnd by all means, keep expenses low.\u201dNext up on the calendar: the so-called Santa Claus rally, which posits that stocks tend to rise during the last five trading days of the calendar year and the first two trading days of the next, and if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s a harbinger of bad times.As Yale Hirsch described the phenomenon, \u201cIf Santa Claus would fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201dThat, too, proved wildly off base last year.The Common Sense column on Dec. 16, about the performance of stock markets in presidential election years, referred incorrectly to gains in Standard & Poor\u2019s when the same party has controlled the White House and the Congress. A gain of 14.1 percent in the index was the average for all years with a Republican president and Congress, while a 16.4 percent gain was the average for all years with a Democratic president and Congress; the figures are not for just the first calendar year of such administrations.Advertisement"}

The push for emissions reductions underscored the potential for the industry to be faced with reserves of fuels that cannot be burned if the targets are to be met \u2014 a prospect known as \u201cstranded assets.\u201dMs. Dorsey argued that since its beginnings as a moral statement against profiting from companies whose products were exacerbating climate change, more institutions have come to detect vulnerabilities in fossil fuel companies as the world shifts toward renewable sources of energy.\u201cThis movement began as an ethical concern, was quickly matched with financial concerns, and I think it\u2019s now being increasingly recognized as a fiduciary duty,\u201d she said, with liability risks to trustees of institutions who fail to recognize those weaknesses and act on them.While the overall value of the funds announcing divestment is measured in the trillions of dollars, the actual amount of investment that was tied to fossil fuels within those funds is much smaller, because no single industry sector predominates in most broad investment funds. Ryan Strode, the director of Arabella Advisors, the group that produced the report, said the precise value of dropped investments was impossible to know. The group focuses on the overall value of the funds under management with divestment pledges, he said, because \u201cThis is the measure of the level of influence that these investors have on the market.\u201dWith the election of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax and has pledged to reverse President Obama\u2019s signature global warming initiatives, activism will be more important, Ms. Dorsey said. And, she added, if the new president wants job growth, continuing to invest in renewable energy is the way to go.\u201cThey should focus on the explosive industries where manufacturing jobs are being created,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a fact-driven world, it\u2019s just very clear.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Driven by Anonymous Ideas Gets New Investments", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A hedge fund powered by ideas from anonymous contributors is attracting some prominent investors.The San Francisco-based hedge fund Numerai announced $6 million in new investments on Monday from a group including Union Square Ventures, the New York-based venture capital firm co-founded by Fred Wilson.Union Square Ventures is joining Numerai\u2019s previous partners, including Peter Diamandis, a founder of Singularity University, and Howard Morgan, a founder of the unusually successful hedge fund firm Renaissance Technologies.Numerai, created by a 29-year-old former quantitative trader, Richard Craib, makes its investments based on models submitted by data scientists, who are allowed to remain anonymous and are paid in Bitcoin based on the success of their models. The models all employ machine learning, which allows algorithms to integrate and adapt to new information over time.\u201cThis is likely the largest ensemble of stock market machine learning models in the world,\u201d said Andy Weissman, a partner at Union Square Ventures who is working with Numerai.Since starting last year, Numerai says, it has given $150,000 to its contributors, and it is aiming to eventually pay out $1 million a month.Numerai is the latest investment fund that has won backers with the promise of sourcing investment algorithms from the crowd. Perhaps the most successful of these new ventures, Quantopian, is already on to its Series C fund-raising round. Quantopian has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the new investing firm run by Steven A. Cohen, Point72 Asset Management.With Quantopian, data scientists submit investing algorithms that asset managers around the world can license and use to trade. The algorithm\u2019s authors get a cut of any profits. The investment ideas are not predictions of specific price patterns, but instead are mathematically based models that can be applied to different investments.Numerai is different from similar funds because its contributors remain anonymous and prove themselves through weekly \u201ctournaments\u201d held by the fund manager.Contributors build their mathematical models using historical stock pricing data put together by Numerai. Their models are then tested on live trading data.Numerai builds its own investment model by aggregating ideas from contributors and weighting them according to their success. Unlike many so-called quant funds, Numerai generally buys and hold stocks for months rather than for minutes or seconds.\u201cWe can have very high conviction that a model will generalize to live data because of how we have framed the problem as a pure machine learning competition,\u201d Mr. Craib said.Because it pays in Bitcoin, Numerai can send money to contributors anywhere in the world without collecting personal information, though this raises the risk that Numerai ends up doing business with unsavory people.Mr. Craib seeded the fund with $1 million of his own money \u2014 he was previously a so-called quant at a large asset manager \u2014 alongside outside investors. He would not say how large the fund was at this point. But he did say that 7,500 data scientists had submitted prediction models so far, leading to 2,675 payouts to contributors.Mr. Craib said that if the fund reached $1 billion in size, it should be paying contributors $1 million a month.An article on Dec. 13 about investments by the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures in a hedge fund powered by ideas from anonymous contributors misstated the role of Fred Wilson. He co-founded Union Square Ventures, but does not lead it. (Albert Wenger and Andy Weissman are its managing partners.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will the Trump Era Bring Higher Interest Rates? Don\u2019t Count On It", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBut what if that\u2019s wrong?The central bank will seek to prevent too much inflation from breaking out in an economy it believes is getting close to operating at its full potential, which means Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus might run up against the Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s (and perhaps her successor\u2019s) counter-stimulus.But it\u2019s worth looking at the two big ways that these forecasts could be wrong, and worth considering that the era of low rates might stick around a bit longer than some of the postelection discussion might have suggested.First, the Trump agenda might pack less of a growth punch than some have imagined. If so, you would expect the same cautious approach to rate increases from the Fed.Second, even if the economy does start growing faster, future Trump administration appointees could change their tune on the desirability of higher interest rates. That has been the pattern with other populist politicians of the Trump mold around the world. Politicians, once in office, tend to learn that they like low interest rates. It\u2019s easy to envision a Trump administration pushing for cheaper money and the Fed attempting to hold the line to prevent inflation.On the first point, it\u2019s worth diving into the details of the Trump policies that led to the postelection-day market rally in stocks and the sell-off in bonds.He wants to enact major tax cuts, for one, which all else being equal, would tend to create a short-term boost in economic growth and higher interest rates. But there are some early signals that the Republican lawmakers who actually have to pass any changes to tax law, especially those in the Senate, are wary of tax cuts that would increase the budget deficit as much as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plan would.Another big plank underneath the idea that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policy will be stimulative is an expectation that he will embrace a large-scale infrastructure spending package.But while the president-elect mentioned that idea in his election victory speech, he hasn\u2019t put much meat on the bones of the plan since. The details matter a great deal for how much an infrastructure plan could lift growth. For example, tax credits that make the finances of building toll roads more favorable are less likely to create a huge boost in activity than spending on upgrading physical infrastructure outright.And that\u2019s before you factor in the risk that some elements of Trump economic policy could end up being a drag on growth. Think of a trade war with China or Mexico, immigration restrictions that limit the supply of labor or geopolitical disputes.All that gives the Fed every reason to take a wait-and-see approach to shaping its policy. If the Trump economy really starts to take off, the Fed could move more aggressively to raise rates. But it will do that based on actual evidence and data rather than the president-elect\u2019s rhetoric.Which leads to the other scenario, in which the economy accelerates at the risk of overheating. History is littered with examples of politicians in that circumstance pressuring their central banks to keep rates low to encourage growth.There are two vacancies on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board of governors already, and Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman expires in February 2018; the vice-chairman Stanley Fischer\u2019s term is up in June of that year. Add it up, and within 18 months of taking office, Mr. Trump could have appointed a majority of the Fed\u2019s board, including its chair and vice chair.That doesn\u2019t mean that Trump nominees for those jobs would necessarily refrain from rate hikes if they believed they were warranted. Many potential Republican Fed nominees have opposed the low interest rate tendency of the Fed under Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke.For the past few administrations, the accepted practice has been that presidents should refrain from weighing in on monetary policy and let the Fed act independently. But Mr. Trump has described himself as a \u201clow interest rate person\u201d and was willing to scrap that precedent by attacking Ms. Yellen by name during the campaign.Also, to be technical about it, even if the Fed kept its short-term interest rate targets low despite rising inflation, long-term interest rates, which are determined by the bond market, would probably rise.If there\u2019s one thing we know about Mr. Trump, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t feel bound by the traditions that have governed how recent presidents have acted. And that means that the future of United States interest rate policy, like so much else, is up for grabs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Math: Heads We Win, Tails You Lose", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWhen do 1.5 and 16 add up to 72?That\u2019s the riddle confronting investors in Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., the closed-end fund run by the prominent activist investor Bill Ackman.That\u2019s obviously a big disappointment, considering the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was up 7.6 percent over the same period. But that\u2019s not what some big investors were complaining about to me this week.In the same letter, Mr. Ackman reported that during the nearly four years since it began, Pershing Square Holdings had gained a total of 20.5 percent. That would be considered mediocre at best, considering the S.&P. 500 gained over 67 percent during the same period.And that\u2019s a 20.5 percent gain before deducting fees. Pershing Square Holdings charges investors a 1.5 percent management fee and takes 16 percent of any gains. After those fees were deducted, investors gained just 5.7 percent.That means Pershing Square kept approximately 72 percent of the fund\u2019s gains for itself, leaving investors with the measly remains.A spokesman for Mr. Ackman declined to comment. But the reality is that many hedge funds, not just Mr. Ackman\u2019s, reap far higher percentages of their gains than that stated in their fee structure. That\u2019s because when they experience substantial losses \u2014 as Pershing Square did last year and is on track to do this year (its year-to-date loss through Tuesday was 12.4 percent) \u2014 they don\u2019t have to give anything back.And for many hedge funds the results are even worse. Most hedge funds charge the proverbial two-and-20 \u2014 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains above a certain threshold. By these measures, Pershing Square Holdings\u2019 lower fee structure is a relative bargain.How could Pershing Square have kept 72 percent of the gains, given that its fee structure calls for a performance fee of just 16 percent?The answer can be found in relatively simple math. As a simple example, consider an investment of $1 million in a fund that generates a 10 percent return in years one and two and then loses 5 percent in years three and four. The investor would end up with about $1.09 million, a total gain of $90,000, or 9 percent, over the four years before fees.But now consider the return after deducting a 20 percent performance fee. In years one and two, the fund manager earns $20,000 and $20,400 for a total of $40,400. The fund\u2019s manager earns nothing in years three and four. After deducting the fees, the investor would end up after the four years with just $1.05 million, a total return of 5 percent. But the $40,400 earned by the fund is nearly 45 percent of the investor\u2019s total gains before fees \u2014 not 20 percent. (And that\u2019s not even figuring in a 1.5 or 2 percent management fee.)If the losses are big enough, the hedge fund manager can capture 100 percent of the gross return, or investors can lose money even as fund managers line their pockets.Investors seem to be finally catching on to the fact that most hedge fund managers share generously in the good times, but are exposed to none of the losses in bad.Because of concerns over high fees and disappointing results, some endowments and pension funds, including those in Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island, have cut back substantially on their hedge fund allocations this year, following the lead of Calpers, the largest pension fund in the United States, which said in 2014 that it would exit hedge funds entirely.Through the third quarter of this year, investors had withdrawn about $51.5 billion from hedge funds, according to Hedge Fund Research.\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for some time that the two-and-20 model is dead,\u201d said Christopher J. Ailman, chief investment officer for the California State Teachers Retirement System, which manages assets of close to $200 billion.\u201cTake the Pershing Square example,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors are only capturing 28 percent of the gains, which is totally out of whack. If it were my money, I\u2019d say it should be the other way around \u2014 the investors should be keeping 70 percent, or even more, like 75 to 80 percent. That\u2019s what I\u2019d consider fair.\u201dMr. Ailman said that he and the chief investment officers for several large pension funds were seeking an alternative fee structure that would preserve a performance incentive for managers but more equitably share the risk. \u201cA few very big states are really thinking through this,\u201d he said.One approach under consideration, he said, is to use a rolling multiyear period for measuring performance fees. In year one, for example, an investor would pay only a portion of the performance fee if there was a gain. If there were losses in subsequent years, the investor would claw back the withheld compensation. That would solve the Pershing Square Holdings problem. \u201cQuite a few large investors are thinking along these lines,\u201d Mr. Ailman told me. \u201cOf course the devil is in the details.\u201dSuch an approach is anathema to most hedge funds, which rely on annual performance fees to compensate their highly paid \u2014 some would say overpaid \u2014 staffs.Even so, hedge funds are competing more fiercely over fees. In a nod to investor concerns, earlier this year Mr. Ackman offered investors an option to pay no performance fees on gains of less than 5 percent, but a steeper 30 percent on gains above that level.\u201cManagement fees pretty much used to be 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Ailman said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing them as low as 70 basis points.\u201d And performance fees, known as carried interest, have dropped in some cases from 20 percent \u201cto the low teens and even as low as 10 percent. And these are large, well-known funds.\u201dHedge fund defenders have said it isn\u2019t fair to pick just four years of performance, like the Pershing Square Holdings example, saying it is too short a track record. Thanks to Mr. Ackman\u2019s early successes, his longtime investors have fared much better than the more recent ones, and cumulative fees are closer to the percentages in the stated fee structures.In his letter to investors, Mr. Ackman pointed to much better results for his older hedge fund, Pershing Square L.P. Since it started in 2004, it has produced annualized compounded returns after fees of 14.9 percent, more than double the S.&P. 500\u2019s 7.6 percent.Still, he acknowledged, \u201cwhile this is a good result, it is below our long-term goals and not much solace\u201d for \u201cinvestors who joined us in recent years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wary Drug Makers Move to Fend Off Further Attacks Under Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byIf the nation\u2019s pharmaceutical executives thought Donald J. Trump would grant them a reprieve from scrutiny over high drug prices, he made them reconsider that idea in the last few days.Biotech stocks promptly fell nearly 3 percent on Wednesday. They recovered slightly on Thursday and Friday, but the comments remained a warning blow for an industry that had rallied in the weeks after the election, on the assumption that Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress would be friendly to the nation\u2019s drug makers. Suddenly, it looked as if pharmaceutical companies might join Carrier, Ford and Boeing as targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire.But unlike those other companies, many drug makers have already been taking steps in recent weeks to insulate themselves from future attacks. Some have pledged to limit price increases. Others offered plain-spoken critiques of drug pricing. And the industry\u2019s two main lobbying groups have pushed ahead with major campaigns intended to win back the narrative.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to villainize pharma, and Trump loves pointing out the bad guys,\u201d said Alana Dovner, a research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors. \u201cAnd pharma knows that.\u201d\u201cIf our industry can self-regulate on pricing, we can all focus on investing in innovative medicines and cures and move the pricing discussion to the back burner,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI think everyone, especially the patient, is better off if that happens.\u201dMr. Saunders and others have aimed to distance themselves from companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, two drug makers that have become the public face of predatory drug pricing, accused of chasing profits not by developing innovative new drugs but by increasing prices on old ones that they had recently acquired.Another pharmaceutical company, Mylan, took a turn in the unwelcome spotlight this summer after raising prices on its treatment for severe allergies, EpiPen. The issue prompted congressional hearings and led to a host of federal investigations, which are still underway.The makers of some new drugs have also come under harsh criticism, accused of charging outlandish prices \u2014 up to $300,000 a year. Those prices have set up a fierce battle from those who are being asked to pay the bill, including insurers and patients.In response, the industry\u2019s two major lobbying groups, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, have started major campaigns to rehabilitate their image, a tacit acknowledgment that they have been losing the public relations battle.\u201cWe\u2019re not telling our story very well,\u201d said James C. Greenwood, the chief executive of the biotechnology group, which is often called Bio. \u201cSo we made a huge effort in the last year to try to be better at telling our story.\u201dThe stakes for the pharmaceutical industry were on full display at the recent health care meeting in New York, where emotions ran high and executives sharply debated who was to blame for the situation they find themselves in.In an interview Thursday, Dr. Schleifer said the industry needed to be more honest with the public. \u201cI felt it was time that we acknowledge that the industry is doing some bad stuff, which is overshadowing all the good things we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this attitude that we shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for what we do is just wrong.\u201dDespite his strongly worded comments this week, some continued to believe that Mr. Trump would go relatively easy on drug companies.\u201cWe\u2019re not panicked, we\u2019re not lighting our hair on fire,\u201d Mr. Greenwood of Bio said. \u201cWe are remaining calm. I think the one thing that is consistent about Donald Trump is he wants there to be more jobs in the U.S., and we\u2019re all about that. And he wants our country to be strong and healthy, and we\u2019re all about that.\u201dThe industry is right not to panic, said Brandon R. Barford, a partner at Beacon. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be some time before they push anything in health care other than Obamacare, repeal and replace,\u201d he said.But drug makers should be on guard, Mr. Barford said, because if another pricing scandal erupts, Mr. Trump will most likely seize the moment.\u201cThis is the perfect pivot point,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Banks Ordered to Repay Customers Over Unfair Mortgages", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byMADRID \u2014 Europe\u2019s highest court ruled on Wednesday that customers of banks in Spain can reclaim billions of euros because lenders did not pass on savings from interest rate cuts on variable-rate mortgages, sending shares in several of the country\u2019s top lenders crashing.The ruling centered on the use of a \u201cfloor clause\u201d in Spanish mortgage contracts during the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Such agreements meant that the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage was always held above a predetermined level, regardless of how low central bank rates fell.Spain\u2019s lenders began to use the clauses in 2009, after the global financial crisis pushed central banks around the world to slash interest rates. That helped preserve bank profit margins but failed to pass rate cuts on to customers beyond a certain level.In 2013, Spain\u2019s supreme court ruled that such deals were illegal, in part because the country\u2019s banks did not adequately explain them to customers. The court did not, however, penalize lenders retroactively.The European Court of Justice on Wednesday confirmed that the agreements were illegal, but went further by ruling that customers could claim reimbursement, without any time limit, for all payments made at a rate that was judged to be too high.The decision, which cannot be appealed, means Spain\u2019s banks could have to return 4.5 billion euros, or about $4.68 billion, to customers, according to Afi, a Spanish financial consultancy.The ruling, which came as a surprise because it went against the opinion issued earlier this year by the court\u2019s main adviser, sent bank stocks tumbling, with some falling as much as 10 percent.BBVA, one of Spain\u2019s largest banks, said that it expected the ruling would reduce its profits by about \u20ac404 million as a result of further provisions it would have to make. Another bank, Bankia, said its mortgage reimbursement claims could reach as much as \u20ac200 million, though it has already made provisions for about half that amount.Other lenders, like Banco Santander and Bankinter, were not as exposed to the ruling because they either did not use \u201cfloor clauses\u201d or had already made provisions against possible reimbursement costs.\u201cThis ruling really wasn\u2019t expected and comes with full retroactivity, which explains the very negative market reaction,\u201d said Miguel Jim\u00e9nez, a fund manager at Renta 4, a Spanish brokerage and asset management firm. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about banks facing major losses or solvency problems but certainly significant provisioning in some cases.\u201dSpain\u2019s banks were able to make hefty profits in the lead-up to the financial crisis because of a construction boom in the country. But during that time, lenders also set upper and lower limits on mortgage payments.After peaking in 2008 at over 5 percent, the Euribor rate \u2014 an interbank lending rate that is the figure typically used by European banks to determine the financing costs of home loans \u2014 began to fall sharply in 2009.That reduced borrowing costs for customers, but Spain\u2019s banks began to use the \u201cfloor clauses\u201d to continue charging customers more than the market interest rate. Homeowners then started challenging the terms of their mortgage contracts as abusive, eventually taking the issue to the courts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Potential Hitch in Zuckerberg\u2019s Stock Plan for Facebook", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorMark Zuckerberg wants to give away nearly all his stake in Facebook, and yet still keep control of the company he helped found. What\u2019s a tech billionaire to do?The neat solution to this problem \u2014 creating a new class of shares \u2014 is par for the course for Silicon Valley, but often gives other shareholders short shrift.With the birth of his daughter last year, Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to transfer 99 percent of his wealth to a company he controls with his wife, which would later donate that money to charity. In giving away his shares, however, he would have to confront the issue of giving up his voting control over Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg currently owns about 15 percent of Facebook, but because most of his stock is Class B shares with 10 votes apiece, he has voting control of the company with 53.8 percent of the votes, a number brought up to about 60 percent of the votes since he also has the ability to vote the shares held by Dustin Moskovitz.If Mr. Zuckerberg fulfilled even part of his giving pledge, which included the donation of $1 billion a year over the next three years, it would mean coming close to losing his control of the company he founded.So he turned to a tried and true strategy: Follow Google.Shareholders hated it and only 12.7 percent of the regular shareholders voted for it, but Mr. Page and Mr. Brin used their control to push it through.The gain for other shareholders is not immediately obvious. The best you could say is that it continues bonding the two founders to Google\u2019s success.At Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg proposed the same structure to his board.Given the clear conflict, a special committee of independent directors was formed, made up of Marc Andreessen, Erskine Bowles and Susan Desmond-Hellmann. These directors were technically independent of Mr. Zuckerberg, though Mr. Andreessen had done business with Facebook. Each was dependent on Mr. Zuckerberg to elect them to the board each year. The committee hired their own law firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, and the investment bank Evercore.This independent committee approved the new stock structure. Under the plan, both Class A and Class B shareholders will receive a dividend of two nonvoting Class C shares, which have equivalent economic value to the Class A and Class B.At face value it appears that everyone is being treated equally, but the deal really benefits Mr. Zuckerberg. With a dividend of over 900 million Class C shares, he can now sell his Class C shares and not reduce his voting control. The net effect of the transaction is that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Class B shares will account for only 5 percent of Facebook\u2019s equity but will have voting control over Facebook. It ensures that Mr. Zuckerberg will have lifetime control over Facebook.It\u2019s a nice deal for Mr. Zuckerberg, but there are potential risks for shareholders. One need only look at Viacom, where the share voting power is held by Sumner Redstone, who is 93 and apparently in poor health. Mr. Zuckerberg may be a genius and capable of operating Facebook now. But he could live to his 90s, and like Mr. Redstone no longer be as capable, instead preferring to assert control simply because he can.And, sure, Facebook pumps out cash like a fire hose, but some check on management would be prudent to avoid the temptation to waste that money on foolhardy projects. (Google Glass, anyone?)This time around, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may have hit pay dirt.As part of discovery in the case, the lawyers have obtained text messages between Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Zuckerberg that appear to show that Mr. Andreessen was leaking information and helping the chief executive while the independent committee was considering this transaction. The text messages were disclosed in a filing made public a few weeks ago.As the special committee was deliberating, Mr. Andreessen \u2014 who was supposed to be representing Facebook shareholders \u2014 appeared to be coaching Mr. Zuckerberg in how to deal with the special committee.According to the filing, Mr. Andreessen texted Mr. Zuckerberg ahead of a meeting to speak beforehand. Lawyers for the shareholders contend that this was to give Mr. Zuckerberg \u201cinside information,\u201d including coaching him on the question of how long he could leave to do government service and still maintain control. And during meetings with the board, Mr. Andreesen sent messages like, \u201cThis line of argument is not helping,\u201d ending with a smiley face, and \u201cNOW WE\u2019RE COOKING WITH GAS.\u201dThese are pretty bad text messages, though Facebook\u2019s lawyers will most likely have an explanation along the lines that this is just the way bargaining works in Silicon Valley.A representative of Facebook declined to comment but referred me to a statement given to Bloomberg that said, \u201cFacebook is confident that the special committee engaged in a thorough and fair process to negotiate a proposal in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders.\u201dThere are a few lessons here even for internet titans.First, do we really have to say in 2016 that you should assume anything you text or email is public? Really?Second, the committee, if we put aside Mr. Andreessen for a moment, seems to have been doing their job in at least thinking about the big issues, particularly Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s government service. And in exchange for putting this new plan into effect, Mr. Zuckerberg did give up something gigantic: He no longer can pass along control to his heirs or simply retire and keep his high vote stock. Now he will have to work at the company to keep control, an important get for the independent committee.The real question here is what Mr. Andreessen was thinking. The committee would probably have come to the same conclusion no matter what, given Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s importance to and control of the company, but at least there was some back and forth.One might guess that Mr. Andreessen was trying to curry favor with Mr. Zuckerberg. His venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, did help sell both Instagram and Oculus investments to Facebook, after all.But given Mr. Andreessen\u2019s great prominence as a venture capitalist, there really was no need to pander like that. And indeed, the more likely explanation is that he thought it was no big deal.Andreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Such an attitude is all too common in Silicon Valley when it comes to corporate governance and lawyers.The text messages that have emerged in this litigation may not change the ultimate outcome. The stock plan is something that Mr. Zuckerberg wants, and Facebook will do what it can to make it happen, even if it includes writing a big check to settle with the shareholders.In addition, the record will most likely show real bargaining by the committee and a real change in governance given Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s giving up control if he doesn\u2019t work.And the company can just reconvene the independent committee and try again \u2014 or even just move out of Delaware, where Facebook is incorporated, to a friendlier state.If Facebook were going public today with such a share-class structure, few investors would bat an eye. Let\u2019s see what happens when Snap goes public. No doubt there will be a very firm structure that ensures Evan Spiegel, 26, maintains control for the rest of his life.That\u2019s too bad. I suppose the foolish view would be that if Mr. Zuckerberg was really good for the long term then he shouldn\u2019t care about share voting control. No one would try to oust him if he were doing a good job. But that is na\u00efve, no doubt.Instead, the message of Facebook is that in Silicon Valley, founders will keep control of their companies no matter what. Also, don\u2019t email or text.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

I did invest and I got out, and it was actually very good timing, but I\u2019ve never been a big investor in the stock market.\u201dWhatever Mr. Trump\u2019s motives, the sale does little to mitigate the larger conflict-of-interest concerns that have followed him since the election.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Looks Awfully Expensive Since the Trump Rally", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsA new president won\u2019t take office for another month, but the financial markets\u2019 early verdict on the Donald J. Trump era is in, and it is straightforward.They are saying the Trump administration will be good for corporate profits, and hence the stock market is way up. (The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is up 6 percent since Election Day). It will also mean higher interest rates and inflation over time. (The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen to 2.6 percent from 1.85 percent in the same span.)But the result of those two shifts should make anyone thinking of investing in the stock market nervous. You\u2019d be counting on the profit-boosting elements of the Trump agenda being enacted and the profit-hampering possibilities not materializing. Another way to think about it: Putting money into the stock market right now means accepting less compensation for taking on risk than was available before Election Day.Consider a simplified, stylized version of the choice that all investors face as they choose between the two most common types of financial assets, stocks and bonds. Suppose you have $1,000 to invest over the next 10 years. If you buy one of the aforementioned 10-year Treasury bonds, you\u2019ll get exactly 2.6 percent of $1,000, or $26, each year for 10 years. Then you\u2019ll get your $1,000 back.If you instead buy $1,000 worth of stocks, you\u2019re buying a flow of income that is much less certain. Right now, the earnings of the S.& P. 500 index amount to 4.7 percent of the value of the index (that\u2019s the earnings-to-price ratio, the inverse of the more widely followed price-to-earnings ratio). So if you buy stocks, you\u2019re figuring that you are buying $47 worth of annual income initially. But that\u2019s a number that could either rise or fall over the coming decade before you look to sell.When you try to determine whether stocks or bonds are more attractive, what matters is how those rates compare to each other and what you expect to happen to corporate earnings in the future. Most of the time, investors demand compensation for taking on the risk of buying volatile, unpredictable stocks.On Election Day, for example, the earnings yield on stocks was 5 percent, and the Treasury bond yield was 1.85 percent, meaning that investors were compensated with an extra 3.15 percentage points on their money for taking the risk of putting it into the stock market.The moves since the election \u2014 higher stock prices and lower bond prices \u2014 have narrowed that gap to only 2.17 percentage points at Friday\u2019s close. The amount of compensation you get for the risk of investing in stocks has fallen by a third in the last six weeks. (The gap has come down a great deal in the last five years as stock prices have risen a lot faster than corporate earnings.)Now, there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d level for this risk compensation. It was lower than it is now throughout the mid-2000s, and was even persistently in negative territory during the late 1990s (though that was in the midst of a stock market bubble). The question at any given moment is whether there is a good justification for the size of that gap.The financial markets\u2019 take on the Trump economy is that it will be good for corporate profitability. A cut in corporate income taxes, a key part of the Trump campaign\u2019s tax plan, would accrue straight to businesses\u2019 bottom line. A lighter touch on regulations should mean companies in regulated sectors like banks and energy companies would become more profitable. If there is a large-scale infrastructure program as Mr. Trump has proposed, it will be good news for companies that supply the heavy construction industry.But the weird thing since the election has been investors\u2019 willingness to price in all the stuff that is good news for corporate earnings while seemingly ignoring the elements that are less welcome for businesses\u2019 bottom line.The dollar is up about 5 percent against a basket of other major currencies since the election, a shift that will damage the earnings of firms with a large international business. The rise in interest rates could hurt sales in rate-sensitive sectors like automobiles and housing. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent, which suggests employers will have to pay more to attract and keep workers in the year ahead.And that\u2019s not even to mention the more speculative risks that could come from a Trump administration. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs and pledged to disrupt trade arrangements that form the very underpinnings of modern global capitalism. If his erratic approach to diplomacy leads to geopolitical conflict, that probably won\u2019t be good for most businesses\u2019 bottom lines.If, like most people, you\u2019re a long-term buy-and-hold investor, it doesn\u2019t make sense to try to time the market by moving money into or out of stocks based on the latest headlines. After all, the more positive view of the outlook for big business could well turn out to be right.But it\u2019s worth keeping your eyes wide open about the risk stock investors are taking, the limited compensation they\u2019re getting for it, and the real possibilities that things could turn out differently.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When a Business Faltered, Small Investors Stood Their Ground", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byFair GameIndividual investors can feel powerless when their stock investments go awry. But sometimes it pays to fight back.Since it ceased making distributions, Breitburn\u2019s publicly traded partnership units have collapsed from around $2 each to 26 cents. That is a disastrous decline, but it pales before the potential hit from a whopping tax bill, a result of the company\u2019s plan to restructure its debts in bankruptcy. In such a deal, the taxman considers the amount of debt forgiven by a company\u2019s creditors to be a form of income granted to its unit holders.Adding insult to injury, at least for individual unit-holders, Breitburn\u2019s executives are not facing this tax problem. They dumped most of their units in the weeks following the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing, eliminating any potential tax they would have owed.And then there\u2019s the final blow in this series of ugly events: Breitburn characterizes the company as \u201chopelessly insolvent,\u201d meaning it expects nothing to be left for the equity holders after its assets are distributed.Such an outcome is not unusual for equity investors in a bankrupt company, of course. But Breitburn\u2019s individual investors are just a tad suspicious of their company\u2019s assessment. They point to Breitburn filings indicating that the value of its assets exceeded its liabilities by $1.3 billion and note that energy prices have recovered since Breitburn filed for bankruptcy.\u201cManagement is trying to steal the company from the equity holders,\u201d said John Myrick, a Breitburn holder who works in television post production in Los Angeles. \u201cWe know there\u2019s value there.\u201dOfficials at Breitburn did not respond to messages seeking comment. But in court filings, the company has said the $1.3 billion in excess value it cited was a stale figure that didn\u2019t reflect the depleted value of the company\u2019s assets.Unfortunately for Mr. Myrick and other Breitburn equity holders, they are battling a longstanding bias against them in bankruptcy proceedings. Equity investors rarely have a say in corporate restructurings, typically dominated by major debtholders. As a result, stockholders must accept valuations of a company\u2019s assets without being able to verify them. This can allow debtholders and other creditors to obtain valuable assets for far less than they are worth.Fearing just this outcome, Mr. Myrick and a throng of other small investors hired lawyers to help them win a role in the restructuring process. How they prevailed is instructive.\u201cThese companies will take advantage of people,\u201d Mr. Myrick said. \u201cWe are going to hold them accountable.\u201dLike many Breitburn investors, he bought his units mainly for their generous monthly income distributions. He also liked that Breitburn was \u201can American company that employed American workers.\u201d Another plus, he thought, was that Breitburn executives owned a lot of the common units, aligning their interests with those of outside holders.After the company stopped making distributions, Mr. Myrick became concerned about Breitburn\u2019s future. In January, he met with Antonio D\u2019Amico, head of Breitburn\u2019s investor relations, who told him the company\u2019s hedge portfolio and vast asset base was structured to survive the energy downturn intact.On May 9, the company filed its first quarter financial report. Falling revenues and rising losses showed the effects of the commodities crash, but Breitburn\u2019s balance sheet also noted its $4.7 billion in assets and $1.3 billion of shareholders equity. Mr. Myrick said the filing encouraged him.A week later, Breitburn filed for bankruptcy.Mr. Myrick was stunned. His shock turned to anger when he saw top Breitburn executives dumping virtually all their common units. Among the sellers were Halbert Washburn, chief executive; Mark Pease, president; and Willis Washburn, a senior vice president. David Kilpatrick, a Breitburn director, also sold his entire position.The insiders were exiting, Mr. Myrick suspected, because they knew they would be subject to significant cancellation of debt income and a monster tax bill if they held on.More troubling, the sales meant that as the company reorganized, the interests of Breitburn\u2019s management were no longer aligned with those of the remaining common unit holders.Moreover, Breitburn executives stood to receive new equity in the company through an incentive pay plan submitted to the bankruptcy court. Their grants would not be subject to a debt cancellation tax and came on top of a sweet $10.7 million executive bonus program adopted just weeks before the Breitburn bankruptcy filing.But the unit-holders\u2019 lawyers argued that such a committee would level the playing field for investors seeking \u201cto vindicate their rights against constituencies with adverse economic interests and unlimited budgets.\u201dThe Securities and Exchange Commission also weighed in to support an equity committee in the bankruptcy; the agency countered Breitburn\u2019s argument that it is hopelessly insolvent.Happily, Judge Bernstein ruled in favor of the investors in October, allowing the formation of an equity committee. Proskauer Rose will represent it.\u201cThe retail holders, like John, had enough courage to throw the proverbial tea into the harbor by writing over 100 letters to the court,\u201d Mr. Indelicato said. \u201cThey alone gave equity a voice and earned a seat at the negotiating table.\u201dIt\u2019s too soon to say whether Breitburn\u2019s equity holders will reap any payout in the restructuring. But there is a lesson here for individual investors: If your company tries to run you over, stand your ground. Who knows, you might just win.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s approach to antitrust laws stands out for its importance. Mr. Trump gained a lot of voter support because of the stagnation of working-class living standards in the face of record corporate profits.But the real challenge to competitive markets today does not come from mergers like this one. The great, but mostly unknown, antitrust story of our time is the astonishing rise of the institutional investor \u2014 a large company, like a mutual fund company, insurance company, pension fund or asset management firm, that buys stock in substantial quantities for the benefit of clients and customers \u2014 and the challenge that it poses to market competition.Economic theory tells us that when a single investor owns large stakes in competing firms, the investor will want firms to keep prices high and wages low. Price and wage competition lowers profits and stock values.Will Mr. Trump fight for the interests of the working-class voters who brought him to power? Our approach would raise living standards while making American companies more competitive.If the new administration\u2019s antitrust enforcers ignore this chance to follow through on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises, voters should hold him to account.Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Cabinet Picks Signal Embrace of Wall St. Elite", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe New York Stock Exchange, the hedge fund billionaire George Soros and the chief executive of the investment bank Goldman Sachs flashed across the screen.Now Mr. Trump has named a former Goldman executive and co-investor with Mr. Soros to spearhead his economic policy.With Wednesday\u2019s nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman trader turned hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier, to be Treasury secretary, a new economic leadership is taking shape in Washington.That two investors \u2014 Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross \u2014 will occupy two major economic positions in the new administration is the most powerful signal yet that Mr. Trump plans to emphasize policies friendly to Wall Street, like tax cuts and a relaxation of regulation, in the early days of his administration.While that approach has been cheered by investors (the stocks of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been on a tear since the election), it stands in stark contrast to the populist campaign that Mr. Trump ran and the support he received from working-class voters across the country.Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund executive and member of the Trump transition team, insisted on Wednesday that appointing wealthy investors did not contradict the campaign\u2019s populist message.\u201cThe working-class people of the United States, they need a break,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cAnd we need to switch them from going from the working class into the working poor into what I call the aspirational working class, which my dad was a member of.\u201dStill, Democrats were quick to attack the latest nomination.\u201cSteve Mnuchin is just another Wall Street insider,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a joint statement. \u201cThat is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington \u2014 that is hypocrisy at its worst.\u201dSo far, none of the nominees who will be shaping economic policy have any significant experience in government.Mr. Mnuchin, 53, and Mr. Ross, 79, are both familiar with buying distressed properties and selling for a profit. But they are political neophytes with scant experience in managing large organizations. They will oversee two government agencies that together employ about 130,000 people around the world.In the case of Mr. Mnuchin at Treasury, his experience as a principal investor who made large sums of money through high-risk, high-return wagers suggests that he will look critically at the thicket of regulations that now constrain the risk-taking activities of investment banks.That could mean a reassessment of what has come to be known as the Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that followed the 2008 financial crisis. The rule forbids banks to make certain speculative investments with their own capital.\u201cI would say the No. 1 problem with the Volcker Rule is it\u2019s too complicated and people don\u2019t know how to interpret it,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to look at what to do with it as we are with all of Dodd-Frank. The No. 1 priority is going to be to make sure that banks lend.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Mnuchin also said he would look to cutting corporate tax rates as a way to increase economic growth. And he said the wealthy would not see a big tax cut.There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachs luminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E. Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican, in 2006.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father, Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm.While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broader financial community it is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s track record at hedge and private equity funds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, that makes him appealing.\u201cMnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers \u2014 Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak their language,\u201d said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. \u201cHe comes from a trading desk, and that\u2019s something that is very strong,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, added.While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of Wall Street, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years of experience managing people and organizations under their belt.Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing of IndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in 2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions.After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted by protesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a small-business lender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain.In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted the deal. \u201cHe purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital,\u201d he said of Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.\u201dMr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan, were sued over their mother\u2019s early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, an investor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. The lawsuit, filed by a trustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3.2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from his mother\u2019s account shortly after she died belonged to other victims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit.Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin.In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company Dune Entertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox. It was a successful partnership; Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune\u2019s money) like \u201cAvatar,\u201d which took in $2.8 billion worldwide in 2009.Some have been major hits, like \u201cGravity,\u201d which took in $723.2 million. But there have also been money losers, including \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea.\u201dStill, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attending celebrity-filled parties at the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the Cannes Film Festival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50 jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo \u2014 playing a Merrill Lynch executive \u2014 in Warren Beatty\u2019s new movie \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201dBeyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners are decidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is Louise Linton, a 34-year-old actress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan real estate: Trump Tower for the president-elect and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin.But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin is described by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command a room. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professional acquaintances than close friends.The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates for Treasury, according to a fund manager close to the president-elect\u2019s economic brain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor who has been close to Mr. Trump for decades.Brooks Barnes and Neil Irwin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Just Handed the Global Economy Another Giant Variable", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byGlobal markets were not lacking in precarious unknowns. Italy just added another.As voters on Sunday emphatically rejected constitutional changes aimed at streamlining government and making it easier to revive a moribund economy, they enhanced concerns that Italy\u2019s banks could spiral into a disaster. They reinvigorated worries about the endurance of the euro currency and broader European economic integration. And they amplified the sense that Europe is a land of disappointing growth, political dysfunction and seething populism.\u201cExistential crisis\u201d had not been on the ballot, but that was essentially the result. The lopsided tally against the reforms \u2014 nearly 60 percent rejected them \u2014 prompted the resignation of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, leaving Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy without clear leadership.Investors initially pushed down the euro before it recovered. They cut the price of Italian government bonds, lifting the yield \u2014 a sign that investors will demand greater reward for the heightened risks of lending to Italy. Investors also unloaded Spanish and Portuguese government bonds.The widening spread between lower-yielding German bonds and those issued by debt-saturated European countries amounts to a flashing indicator that investors see risks for the southern periphery. These market moves were muted because the results had been anticipated.Indeed, for Europe and the rest of the world, this dynamic was uncomfortably familiar. For nearly a decade, the 19 nations sharing the euro have lurched from one crisis to the next, with no effective fix. A currency designed to unite the adversaries of World War II has instead generated fresh divisions \u2014 between creditor and borrower; Northern Europe and the Mediterranean.In a year in which Britain voted to abandon the European Union and the American electorate selected Donald J. Trump as the next president, Italy offered its own contribution to the global populist insurrection. Against this backdrop, the basic contours of the world economy are now uncertain.Even that possibility threatens Europe with trouble. If investors worry that Italy may leave the euro, they will demand greater rewards for continued lending. Those with the greatest debt burdens \u2014 Greece, Spain and Portugal \u2014 could see their borrowing costs rise beyond their ability to pay.For now, such grim scenarios appear remote. The referendum maintains the power of the Italian legislature\u2019s upper chamber, a potent check on the Five Star Movement, or any government pursuing radical change.The most immediate consequences fall on the Italian banking system, now choked with some 360 billion euro, or about $385 billion, in suspect debts.Mr. Renzi tried and failed to inject public funds into Monte dei Paschi, the perpetual locus of fears about an Italian-bred financial conflagration. The European Union, led by Germany, effectively forbade that step, citing new rules barring taxpayer bailouts to limit the temptation of bankers to engage in reckless lending.Mr. Renzi instead forged a plan that has Monte dei Paschi scrambling to secure \u20ac5 billion from private investors.\u201cFor Monte dei Paschi, it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to close the capital raise by end of the year,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. \u201cThe political future is so uncertain.\u201dMost experts assume a caretaker Italian government will wind up seeking permission from European authorities for some form of a taxpayer-financed rescue of Monte dei Paschi, while agreeing to wipe out the investments of a thin slice of bondholders.The consensus is that Italy can patch immediate holes in the banking system. But the referendum has destroyed what momentum existed to address the condition that is both cause and effect of the banking problem \u2014 a dire lack of economic growth.Mr. Renzi pursued reforms aimed at spurring companies to invest. He made it easier for companies to terminate low-performing workers to eliminate a chief impediment to hiring them in the first place \u2014 the fear that giving someone a job was akin to adopting them as a dependent forever.He sought to speed civil processes in the notoriously inefficient court system to make it easier for banks to recoup bad debts by collecting collateral.The constitutional changes he sought were aimed at clearing another blockage to reform. They would have trimmed the powers of the upper chamber of the legislature, a place where proposals die.Voters clearly did not trust Mr. Renzi to wield greater power. Now, they will be represented by someone with less power where it matters a great deal: Brussels and Berlin.Debt-saturated nations in Europe have long argued that their burdens would be lighter if they could spend more money to spur faster economic growth.But the European Union \u2014 anchored by Germany \u2014 has cited rules limiting the spending of member governments with big debts. Instead, Brussels and Berlin argue, such countries must deliver so-called structural reforms, stripping away labor protections and trimming pension benefits.In a testament to the severity of this creed, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble effectively threatened to banish Greece from the euro if Athens did not deliver on reforms it promised as a condition of successive European bailouts.Mr. Renzi was a rare leader who carried credibility in such quarters. He gained modest relief from European spending strictures in part by pointing at his reforms.\u201cRenzi is the only leader in recent history who has advanced a structural reform agenda,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.Now, Mr. Renzi is gone, along with his reform trajectory. What is most palpably still here is an Italian economy that is growing anemically, soon to be presided over by a caretaker government with a limited mandate.\u201cWhat chance does a less effective prime minister overseeing a caretaker government have of getting a hearing in Brussels and Berlin?\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible.\u201dItaly has no fuel for growth. It has no clear way to extricate itself \u2014 or the other parts of the planet connected to money \u2014 from the perils of its grinding banking crisis. And the one reinforces the other.Advertisement"}

Prosecutors say he and two Israelis, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, used the stolen account details from JPMorgan Chase, Fidelity Investments, E-Trade and others for a wide range of frauds, including manipulating stocks. They then laundered the money abroad, the authorities say. Israel deported Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein to the United States in July. Mr. Aaron pleaded not guilty Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, called the scheme \u201csecurities fraud on cybersteroids,\u201d and said the group had perpetrated \u201cthe largest theft of personal information from U.S. financial institutions ever.\u201dDespite the gravity of the charges, Mr. Aaron had lived freely in Moscow for eight months in a downtown apartment. Even after his arrest this year on a visa violation charge, Mr. Aaron was not immediately deported.There is no indication Mr. Aaron had any ties to the political hacking that has roiled Washington since the summer.Russia has no extradition treaty with the United States and a long history of stonewalling on cross-border cybercrime investigations. Most famously, it has refused to extradite Edward J. Snowden, who is wanted in connection with obtaining and releasing a vast trove of surveillance data from the National Security Agency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Highlights: Italy Considers What\u2019s Next After Matteo Renzi Loses Referendum", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported by\u25a0 Mr. Renzi had said he would resign after voters rejected changes to the Constitution that he supported in what amounted to a referendum on the prime minister\u2019s government.As promised, Mr. Renzi submitted his resignation to Mr. Mattarella on Monday evening at the Quirinale Palace, the president\u2019s official residence, but the president asked Mr. Renzi to defer his resignation to see through the approval of his government\u2019s budget.An official from the office said the budget was expected to be passed this week.Mr. Mattarella\u2019s request was not unusual: His predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano, had \u201cfrozen\u201d the resignations of two prime ministers so that pending laws could be passed.Once Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation eventually takes effect, Mr. Mattarella will work with Italian political leaders to discuss what comes next. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and JASON HOROWITZItaly greeted the news of Mr. Renzi\u2019s symbolic defeat with uncertainty on Monday. A headline in the daily La Repubblica declaring, \u201cThe No Triumphs, Renzi Quits,\u201d echoing the sentiment in most newspapers.Commentators acknowledged Mr. Renzi\u2019s dignified reaction to what mostly seemed a vote against his tenure, and they called for responsibility from political forces.\u201cNow the reality is the risk of a return to the swamps and to instability,\u201d Mario Calabresi, editor in chief of La Repubblica, wrote in a front-page editorial on Monday. \u201cA scenario that Italy really doesn\u2019t need.\u201dOnce Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation is official and he steps down, Mr. Mattarella would then hold talks with the political parties trying to form a caretaker government or call early elections.According to the Italian news media, one candidate who could lead a temporary government is Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a technocrat. The speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso, a longtime anti-mafia magistrate, is also a possibility.Although most opposition parties are pushing for quick elections, opponents of Mr. Renzi in his Democratic Party are more inclined to take their time. \u2014 GAIA PIANIGIANIBeppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement who campaigned against the proposed constitutional changes and against Mr. Renzi, declared on Monday that \u201ctimes have changed.\u201dHow much so may depend on Mr. Grillo\u2019s ability to parlay his latest success into a full sweep of the political establishment he has thumbed his nose at for years.Mr. Grillo, a former comedian, said that Italians should waste no time pressing for a new electoral law and for the dismantling of the old order.The Five Star Movement won a quarter of the vote in 2013 national elections. Mr. Grillo said then that cooperating with traditional parties in any sort of alliance would be akin to capitulation.A breakdown of returns shows that opposition to the constitutional changes was widespread, though more pronounced in the south.Only three regions backed the changes: the historically leftist areas of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna in central Italy, and Trentino-Alto Adige in the far north.In the economically struggling Sicily and Sardinia, which voted against the changes, the divide between the camps was as large as 44 percentage points. The pattern was similar in areas with high unemployment and social problems.\u201cThe country isn\u2019t growing, and voters blamed their personal condition on the government,\u201d said Stefano Folli, a commentator for La Repubblica.The results also reflected a generational divide. According to a survey reported by the news channel Sky TG24, young voters rejected the proposed changes, while more than half of those over 55 supported them. \u2014 GAIA PIANIGIANIIn analyzing the results, Italian pundits did not always agree, except on one point: the severe consequences for Mr. Renzi.\u201cDoes Renzi represent the country from a political, cultural point of view? Yesterday\u2019s vote is a clear rejection of Renzi\u2019s economic policies and of how he envisioned the country,\u201d the political commentator Mario Sechi said. Mr. Renzi \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him,\u201d he added.For Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the \u201cno\u201d campaign brought together divergent political forces.Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renzi\u2019s \u201creformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium,\u201d he said.The nearly 60 percent of the population that voted against him is \u201chighly divided, with nothing in common, and no leader,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. What joins them is a conservative, anti-European outlook. \u201cWithin that, you have the most extreme left and right.\u201dThe person to watch in the short term is Mr. Mattarella, the president. \u201cThis is the first real test of the president of the Republic, who has kept mostly in the background,\u201d said Antonio Polito, deputy director of the Milan-based daily Corriere della Sera. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDOThe euro first fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading after the vote, but recovered by the morning in Europe, and it even gained ground compared with last week. Major European stock markets were all slightly higher. \u2014 JACK EWINGThe vote results and Mr. Renzi\u2019s decision to step down drew a jubilant response from other populist leaders in Europe.How leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.The image of Italy as a nation that \u201cbobs more or less happily in stagnant water between the third largest public debt in the world and a banking system in a deep coma\u201d must be \u201cvigorously contested,\u201d he wrote.\u201cJust as a \u2018Yes\u2019 victory wouldn\u2019t have been a passport to paradise, the \u2018No\u2019 vote is not a condemnation to hell. In any case, hard and serious work is needed to face a massive challenge, of finding real growth and modernizing a system that\u2019s been weakened by a violent crisis and by innumerable problems that have been dragging on for decades.\u201dVincenzo Boccia, the president of Italy\u2019s main business lobby, Confindustria, said the referendum results highlighted the need to tackle pressing economic issues like \u201cdebt, deficit and still-insufficient growth.\u201d\u201cGrowth is the only way to eliminate inequalities and poverty,\u201d he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Italian companies have been making \u201ccrucial efforts\u201d to compete in international markets, he added, and need the government to back them up. \u2014 ELISABETTA POVOLEDOThe populist victory in Italy was hailed by many like-minded leaders across Eastern Europe, where similar sentiments are on the rise, but their reaction was tempered by widespread concern that the results would accelerate the fraying of the European Union, upon which the region has come to depend.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Poland, the largest economy in the region, seemed torn between praising a victory by populists who share its governing party views and worrying about vulnerability to Russia.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Tomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic strategist in Prague for the lender CSOB, tied the Italian defeat directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and predicted a dire future. \u201cDemocracy, and the future of the euro in Europe, is truly walking on the edge of a knife,\u201d he said.In Slovakia, where anti-euro sentiment is widespread, many residents say that embracing the currency led to higher prices for everyday goods. \u201cWe can expect a referendum about leaving the eurozone,\u201d predicted Richard Zulik, leader of Slovakia\u2019s liberal Freedom and Solidarity party. \u2014 RICK LYMANFinance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro expressed relief that the economic reaction to the Italian referendum was muted. Yet the vote could still roil the European Union: It threatens to embolden opponents of the single currency, which could destabilize the Italian economy and foment turmoil in the banking sector.Helping to stoke that concern is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s oldest lender, which faces questions about whether it has sufficient capital.Asked whether a planned capital increase for the bank would now be delayed, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the so-called Eurogroup of finance ministers, emphasized that Italy first needed to select a new leader.Even as Brussels scrambled to stave off negative financial consequences, ministers from fiscally hawkish countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not want to be seen by their own electorates as being overly permissive toward Italy.\u2014 JAMES KANTERAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Fund Seeks Both Financial and Social Returns", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cThere is a lazy mindedness that we afford the do-gooders.\u201dThat was Bono, the musician turned activist turned investor, lamenting the pitfalls of what has become an increasingly fashionable form of financing: social impact investing.Just about every big Wall Street firm and big-time philanthropist has recently tried to get in on what\u2019s often called double bottom line investing. The idea is that an investment isn\u2019t just intended to score a high return; perhaps more important, it is supposed to make a significant difference in an area that had been considered un-investable. Goldman Sachs, for example, created social impact bonds to reduce the recidivism rate for adolescent offenders at the Rikers Island correctional facility in New York City.Most of these efforts have had mixed results; either investors lost money, or the social impact was negligible or nonexistent.It has become, as Bono told me, \u201ca lot of bad deals done by good people.\u201dMr. McGlashan has long overseen TPG Growth, a fund he started that was an early investor in the sharing economy, with stakes in Uber and Airbnb, as well other technology successes like Spotify. His first fund had an annualized rate of return \u2014 the metric that private equity firms use to measure themselves \u2014 of 20 percent; the second fund\u2019s return was 45 percent.Others have tried to build social impact funds at a much smaller scale. Rise does away with benchmarks manufactured after the fact and has created a series of strict metrics by which to measure social impact. And an outside auditor has been brought in to keep it honest.And the investors involved don\u2019t consider this charity \u2014 pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are expected to be among the biggest investors. At least two large pension funds and one sovereign wealth fund have committed nine figure sums, according to people briefed on the investments, which have yet to be made public.\u201cThe reality is that no matter which side of the aisle you\u2019re on, and no matter where your framework is, if I can build a great business that\u2019s profitable and successful and, oh, by the way, here\u2019s the impact and the multiple of impact that\u2019s created through that business\u2019s successes, I think that\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d Mr. McGlashan told me.The new fund is expected to invest about half of its money domestically in areas like health care, education and clean energy technologies. The other half will be invested in emerging markets in sectors like microlending and other financial services, housing and education.\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of charity here,\u201d Mr. McGlashan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make money and build profitable successful businesses and create a top performing fund. But in the process, what we\u2019ve committed to is that we will not do a deal where there\u2019s less than a two and a half times multiple of impact,\u201d suggesting a meaningful social impact that can be measured.The problem with most of these kinds of funds is what Mr. McGlashan calls \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d a euphemism for lying, which some in philanthropy feel is rampant among socially conscious investors. Everyone wants to claim some form of success using a shifting mix of metrics aimed at demonstrating how the fund worked.\u201cNone of this makes sense unless you can actually define what \u2018impact\u2019 means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be religion; it has to be quantitative. It has to be something that a third-party view would validate.\u201dBono put it this way: \u201cI asked them to hang a sign in their office saying, \u2018Warm Fuzzy Feelings Not Welcome Here,\u2019 because we need them to be tough-minded. We need some intellectual rigor, and you\u2019ve got to get these metrics right.\u201dMr. McGlashan, often in concert with Mr. Skoll, spent the past year working with Bridgespan Group, a consulting firm that has long worked for philanthropists \u2014 including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 to come up with a rigorous set of metrics with which to measure performance.If it works, Mr. McGlashan hopes to one day change the fee structure of funds like this so the investors are paid based on social impact, not necessarily just on financial performance. For the first Rise fund, Mr. McGlashan\u2019s group, which will include most of TPG Growth\u2019s professional staff, will be paid on financial performance, which is likely to make his job harder, not easier. He needs to find good investments, but his board and investors will also be focusing on whether the fund also delivers on its social impact promise.Mr. Skoll said he expected to know whether the fund would be successful in relatively short order. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a good idea within two years,\u201d he said.Bridgespan\u2019s metrics for Rise could become a model for other investment firms if they prove successful, especially in a global political climate that is rethinking its capitalistic system.\u201cCapitalism is going up on trial, and I think that it\u2019s clear that putting profit before people is a nonsustainable business model,\u201d Bono said. \u201cI think giving those two equal time is the way forward, and I think that in the present climate, we need to rethink, reimagine what it is. It\u2019s not that capitalism is immoral; it\u2019s amoral. And it\u2019s a better servant than master.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have to be a bit modest about where we are with Rise and be actually a bit tough on ourselves. I\u2019d be more comfortable speaking about this in a year\u2019s time or two year\u2019s time as we go along.\u201dLet\u2019s plan on that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Top Chinese Financier Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 One of China\u2019s best-known financiers, sometimes called his country\u2019s equivalent to Carl C. Icahn, has pleaded guilty to insider trading and stock price manipulation, in a case that forms part of a broader nationwide push against financial improprieties.The plea follows a series of signals from China\u2019s leaders that they are stepping up investigations of financial improprieties. Allegations of such activities are central to three big campaigns underway in China.They include an anticorruption drive that has already led to the arrest of more than 100,000 officials; a push to clean up financial markets after last year\u2019s stock market crash that has produced a series of investigations of traders, executives and regulators; and an effort to slow or halt large outflows of money from China through illegal or semi-legal channels.Steve Vickers, a political risk consultant in Hong Kong, predicted that Mr. Xu\u2019s court case would prove a harbinger of other financial prosecutions. \u201cI would think you\u2019ll see a whole series of cases,\u201d he said.Mr. Xu, sometimes nicknamed Big Xu, was the reclusive owner of Zexi Investment, a Shanghai-based firm with financial results that far outperformed its rivals during the years up to and even after China\u2019s stock market bubble burst in the summer of 2015. He has been likened to Mr. Icahn for his vigorous assertion of minority shareholder rights.The Hurun Report, a monthly magazine based in Shanghai that tracks the wealth of China\u2019s richest people, estimated last year that Mr. Xu and his relatives were worth $2.2 billion. Mr. Xu was a celebrity investor when share prices were more than doubling from late 2014 through mid-June of last year, drawing in millions of novice investors who then lost their savings in the ensuing crash.Share prices eventually stabilized at a little more than half their peak, but only after the Chinese government poured tens of billions of dollars into buying large blocks of shares in many of the country\u2019s biggest and most liquid stocks. The market intervention partly undid the government\u2019s efforts in previous years to privatize part of its huge holdings of large Chinese enterprises.The debacle drew angry calls on social media for the authorities to investigate prominent traders, especially those like Mr. Xu who seemed to have avoided losses.Zexi Investment has largely ceased to function.

State-controlled news media have said that Mr. Xu could receive up to a decade in prison if the guilty plea is endorsed.The court\u2019s statement said that it had heard evidence that Mr. Xu had helped set up and secretly control about 100 securities accounts. They were mostly registered in the names of friends, employees and relatives, and Mr. Xu received a portion of the profit from the coordinated trading of the accounts, the court said.Mr. Xu also profited from conspiring with top executives at 13 companies to control the timing and content of favorable corporate announcements, the court said. Two co-defendants with Mr. Xu also pleaded guilty.According to Chinese news media, Mr. Xu\u2019s legal representative in the case was Qian Lieyang, one of China\u2019s most famous lawyers for prominent and politically connected defendants.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Treasury Pick Moves in Secretive Hedge Fund Circles", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byAs a hedge fund manager, Goldman Sachs trader and bank chief executive, Steven T. Mnuchin has long been a member of the financial elite.Yet even on Wall Street he was not widely known before Donald J. Trump chose him to be his campaign fund-raiser last spring.Now, Mr. Mnuchin is on a path to become the first hedge fund manager to head the Treasury. As befitting that closed-door world of finance, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s record shows a willingness to take on risks and a penchant for secrecy that members of both parties expect will be a focus of his Senate confirmation hearing.A case in point is a Delaware company that he owns, Steven T. Mnuchin Inc., whose existence has not been reported outside of official records.Mr. Mnuchin set up the company months before Goldman went public in May 1999. It had a Goldman mailing address and at least one Goldman director. It stayed that way years after he left the Wall Street bank in 2002 to start his hedge fund career.Its purpose is a mystery. The only clue is in a description on corporate filings in Delaware calling the entity an \u201cinvestment in partnerships.\u201dBarney Keller, a representative for Mr. Mnuchin, said the company \u201cheld small legacy Goldman Sachs investments\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t made any new investments since 2002.\u201dOver the course of his career, Mr. Mnuchin, 53, has kept a low profile and has rarely granted interviews. His one previous spell in the limelight was when he ran OneWest Bank.He and other deep-pocketed investors cobbled together the California bank out of the wreckage of IndyMac, a lender that the federal government seized in 2008 as the financial crisis grabbed hold of the nation. His tenure at OneWest spurred controversy because tens of thousands of borrowers \u2014 many of them older people \u2014 were foreclosed on.When a group of protesters gathered outside his Los Angeles house in October 2011 to voice their anger at OneWest\u2019s foreclosure practices, police officers were called to disperse the crowd. He responded later by periodically scrubbing the internet of any reference to his home address to protect the privacy of his three young children, according to a filing Mr. Mnuchin made in a 2014 divorce proceeding.He is more comfortable in his own element \u2014 wealthy hedge fund managers like himself.Days after being tapped by Mr. Trump to be his finance chairman in May, Mr. Mnuchin flew out to a hedge fund conference at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. There, in a swirl of rock concerts, pool parties and casino nights, he schmoozed with billionaires.Mr. Mnuchin dined with Kenneth C. Griffin, the Chicago hedge fund titan, and government veterans like David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director and retired general, and John A. Boehner, the former House speaker. He shook hands with Leon Cooperman, a 73-year-old pioneer in the industry and another Goldman Sachs alumnus.It is these ties, however, that are expected to be fertile ground of investigation for senators who must confirm his selection as Treasury secretary.\u201cI think he would be controversial \u2014 former Treasury secretaries have been top bankers and businessmen or lawyers and they were well-recognized top leaders in their professions,\u201d said Prof. Richard Sylla at the Stern School of Business of New York University, whose research focuses on financial history and economics. \u201cBut Mnuchin wasn\u2019t that famous as a Goldman Sachs guy, and probably not even as a hedge fund guy, so why is he there? Well, he took the job of raising money for Trump.\u201dMr. Mnuchin shares a network with some of the biggest names in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, but his work with Mr. Paulson is of particular interest.An adviser to Mr. Trump, Mr. Paulson, who is best known for making a $15 billion wager that the housing market would collapse, has managed some money for the president-elect.The seemingly off-the-cuff declaration was cheered by hedge fund managers and others who have bet big on the privatization of Fannie and Freddie. One of Mr. Paulson\u2019s bigger bets is that the federal government will return Fannie and Freddie to private investors largely unfettered.And Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s remark may have benefited someone else: Mr. Trump has invested $3 million to $15 million with Mr. Paulson\u2019s hedge fund, according to the financial disclosure statement filed during his run for president.To date, the Trump transition team has not commented on whether Mr. Trump continues to own stakes in Mr. Paulson\u2019s firm and other hedge funds listed on the disclosure statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not sharing any additional information at this time,\u201d said Jason Miller, a Trump representative.The president-elect has said that he will announce a plan for separating himself from his many business interests before his inauguration on Jan. 20. Similarly, Mr. Mnuchin will have to file financial disclosures with the Senate Finance Committee before his confirmation hearing. On Monday, he began the process by filing three years of tax returns.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s time at his hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, which he formed with two former Goldman colleagues in 2004, is one area that the Senate Finance Committee is expected to examine more closely.At its peak, the firm had roughly $2 billion and was backed by the billionaire investor George Soros. It had a taste for real estate, movie financing deals and exotic investments including life insurance policies, which Dune bought through a third party at discounted prices from cash-poor older Americans.Dune had plans to package the insurance policies \u2014 called life settlements \u2014 into bonds that could be sold to investors. Life settlements represent one of the most macabre actuarial bets that Wall Street has dreamed up. It\u2019s a wager that the elderly person selling the policy will die sooner rather than later, meaning the hedge fund does not have to make many premium payments to keep the insurance policy in force and collect the payout upon that person\u2019s death.But the market for life settlements largely collapsed during the financial crisis.Eventually, Dune, like many hedge funds during the worst of the crisis, faced investor withdrawals. Mr. Mnuchin and one of his co-founding partners, Chip Seelig, decided to wind down the operation. The real estate arm of Dune was spun off into a firm led by Dune\u2019s third co-founder, Daniel M. Neidich.After the split, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Seelig set up shop in Southern California. Both became big players in movie financing, lending money to hits like \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cGravity\u201d along with flops like \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea.\u201dIn late 2008, Mr. Mnuchin joined with Mr. Paulson to put together the OneWest deal. They were part of the initial round of bidding for the assets of IndyMac, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had seized that summer. The group, which also included Mr. Soros and other investors, won the deal with a $1.55 billion bid.One of the competing bids was put together by J. Tomilson Hill, head of the Blackstone Group\u2019s hedge fund and asset management group, and Goldman.\u201cAs a deal person, I had nothing but admiration for how entrepreneurial he was and how quickly he adapted to the circumstances,\u201d Mr. Hill said in a recent interview. He was one of the first to call Mr. Mnuchin to congratulate him on his new job as campaign finance chairman.The remnants of IndyMac reopened under the name OneWest with Mr. Mnuchin as chairman and chief executive. But controversy followed, including complaints over foreclosures on soured mortgages that IndyMac had written before the crisis. In particular, it drew scrutiny for its business in reverse mortgages \u2014 products pitched to older people who had paid off their initial mortgages but needed cash.The Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating complaints about the foreclosure practices of OneWest\u2019s reverse mortgage business, which resulted in 16,000 foreclosures alone.An analysis in 2015 presented by the California Reinvestment Coalition, which lobbied against the merger, found that 68 percent of the 36,000 foreclosures in California by OneWest, including those on reverse mortgages, occurred in communities that were primarily nonwhite. A government filing shows OneWest offered to modify about 101,000 mortgages for its customers.Mr. Mnuchin stepped down from the helm of OneWest in March, not long before he became among the first in finance to come out for Mr. Trump and against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Keller said Mr. Mnuchin was \u201cproud of his record at OneWest.\u201dStill, the worlds of finance and politics can be small ones, and Mr. Mnuchin even has a connection to Mrs. Clinton. The in-house accountant at Goldman who prepared a tax filing for Steven T. Mnuchin Inc. many years ago has among her clients, at her current accounting firm, the former Democratic presidential candidate.Susan C. Beachy and Ciaran McEvoy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Butter and Shrimp Make Holiday Magic", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteBefore I ever tucked into a dish of potted shrimp, I\u2019d always imagined it to be the kind of thing a British vicar might be offered when he stopped to call on a pair of elderly sisters for tea. Wholesome and nourishing, but not at all sexy.My first taste, at a seafood restaurant in London, threw that idea on its head. The tiny pink shrimp were succulent and plump, bursting with brininess. Even better, they were coated in golden butter \u2014 not melted, but semifirm at room temperature \u2014 which turned velvety when plopped on the hot toast served alongside.From my American perspective, it was a bit like a lobster roll, but with even more of a textural contrast between the crunchy brown toast and the tender shrimp.Historically, shrimp, as well as other seafood and meats, were potted as a way to preserve them. The cooked shrimp were put into crocks or ramekins and covered in spiced, clarified butter, which sealed them from contact with air.Next, I increased the spices in the butter. Traditionally, a bit of mace, a hint of pepper and a trace of anchovy suffice. In my recipe, I use all three, along with cayenne, garlic and thyme. I also added a pinch of celery seed, inspired by lobster rolls.With modern refrigeration, you no longer need to clarify butter, which removes its water content, to improve its preserving abilities. And so you may think you can skip that step here. You can, but you shouldn\u2019t. With its smooth, satiny texture, the clarified butter cap is an elegant contrast to the soft shrimp below.Potted shrimp is an extremely rich dish \u2014 think of it like a shrimp p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u2014 so serve small portions as an appetizer either before a light meal, or with a big salad as your meal.

{"Headline": "Surge in Dollar Provokes Jitters in Emerging Markets Around World", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byThe election of Donald J. Trump has set off a monthlong run of investor ebullience, whose highlight has been a sustained increase in the value of the dollar against the world\u2019s currencies.It is a surge that has been embraced on Wall Street as a powerful emblem for a United States economy potentially poised to hit a higher gear thanks to tax cuts, government spending and regulatory relief \u2014 policy measures that the president-elect has promised to enact immediately.But around the globe, the surge in the dollar is provoking financial jitters.Emerging market countries and corporations that have been binging on cheap dollar debt for more than a decade now face a spike in servicing costs and elevated debt burdens.And the global financial giants \u2014 banks, insurance companies and mutual, pension and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 that have financed this $10 trillion borrowing bonanza must confront a period of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions that will make them less willing to extend credit to companies and investors alike.\u201cIt is the ubiquitous nature of the dollar and its role in the global banking system,\u201d said Hyun Song Shin, the head of research at the Bank of International Settlements, a forum for global central banks. \u201cWhen the dollar goes up, it directly impairs the risk-taking capacities of banks and investors alike.\u201dA sharp move up in the currency should be seen as a blinking red warning light for investors, he wrote. When it moves in the other direction, then it is \u201crisk on,\u201d to use trader parlance for when it is time to lay down speculative bets.Since the election last month, a broad index for the dollar has risen 4 percent. This move, however, masks even sharper increases against a number of currencies.The dollar has gained 10 percent against the Mexican peso and 8 percent against the Japanese yen.Against the Chinese yuan, the move has been less pronounced \u2014 just 1.5 percent. But Mr. Trump\u2019s combative language toward China has ignited concerns in Beijing that local savers will try to send more of their deposits abroad, putting more downward pressure on the yuan.The rockiest reaction so far to the dollar\u2019s tear has been in Turkey.When the Turkish lira fell to its lowest level in decades against the dollar last week, the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took the unusual step of urging Turks to sell the dollars that they had been hoarding and buy their local currency.With its high levels of debt in dollars and reliance on volatile capital flows for its financing needs, Turkey, more than most of its peers, has been vulnerable to the episodic fits of the emerging markets contagion that have plagued the global economy in recent decades.Boldly new, as well as contentious, Mr. Shin\u2019s thesis has not been wholly embraced by economists and policy makers.For example, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the regulator that keeps the closest eye on incipient financial risks, has made it clear on numerous occasions that the dollar\u2019s recent rise should be seen as a positive sign.It is not just what a strong dollar says about a growing United States economy, but it is the further prospect that, as a result, Japan and Europe may also emerge from their years of deflationary slough.But as Mr. Shin and his team of economists at the Bank of International Settlements see it, it is not just the threat of the dollar\u2019s rise precipitating a crisis in a dollar-sensitive market like Turkey, South Africa or Brazil that is cause for worry.His concerns also center on the global banking system and the possibility that the dollar\u2019s rise will accentuate what he refers to as an emerging dearth of dollars, which could bring back memories of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when a global rush into dollars created a liquidity panic.Short-term borrowing rates skyrocketed, forcing hedge funds to shut down and banks to fail.\u201cThe lessons of the dollar is that everything is connected,\u201d he said. \u201cSpillovers and spill backs can loom large.Since the election, the cost of borrowing dollars short term in all these currencies has risen markedly, with Japan being the outlier.Connections between sustained periods of dollar strength and bouts of financial instability have been drawn by other analysts, like Julian Brigden at Macro 2 Intelligence Partners. In particular, he points to two such periods.The first is 1979 to 1985, when the dollar rose over 80 percent after Paul A. Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, increased interest rates and President Ronald Reagan came to power pushing tax cuts.Then there were the years between 1995 to 2002, when currency crises rippled through Southeast Asia and the implosion of the dot-com boom in the United States rocked stock markets.That would be the flip side of quantitative easing, the policy of the past decade where central banks have flooded the world with cash in a bid to spur growth and combat deflation.\u201cThis is a concern for Fed Chair Yellen,\u201d said Paul Christopher, an investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. \u201cIn the type of global economy we live in, she has to be careful about the dollar increasing too much, creating dollar shortages and liquidity problems as a result.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the surge in the dollar and its effects on emerging markets misstated a goal of quantitative easing. It is to combat deflation, not inflation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bookworm\u2019s Travel Plan", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byEssayYears ago, while I was in Antigua with my family, disaster struck. I ran out of good books. This was before the age of Kindle, so I didn\u2019t have the download option, but even if I\u2019d had it, books via pixels aren\u2019t for me. I need the real thing: a solid slab that I can hold in my hands.And now I was looking at six days in the tropics without a single decent book and nothing but sand and sea and endless food on the horizon.Ordinarily, finding myself with the wrong sort of reading material wouldn\u2019t have posed a crisis, but because there wasn\u2019t a real bookstore on the entire island, it wasn\u2019t just a crisis, but an all-out emergency. What was I supposed to do during those long hours on a beach chair? It was like being incarcerated in paradise.But more than that, bookstores are, for me, destinations in and of themselves, little slices of the local culture that are the same, yet somehow different, unique, each with its own local flavor or bias or accent.The school year finally started, and the kids had some place to go \u2014 me, not so much. Finally, I busted out my umbrella, took to the streets and stumbled into a time warp consisting of dust and books. Piles of them. Whole mountain ranges of them. It was a veritable temple devoted to the past two or three centuries of first-rate, secondhand and antiquarian books: the Bront\u00eb sisters, the Mitford sisters, George Eliot, James Joyce, James Jones, Henry James.I walked home with it tucked under my arm, this massive Victorian book in this massive Victorian town. And for the rest of the year, whenever I felt low, or just needed to be in a place where the dust itself hinted of adventures, I\u2019d be back at the shop, with its big front windows crammed with (what else?) books and the wonderful smell of dusty old books.It\u2019s funny, my need for a book I can lose myself in, and the bookstores in which they can be tested, tasted and thumbed-through, because for most of my growing-up years, I wasn\u2019t much of a reader. I preferred comic books, TV and wandering through the wooded hills surrounding my childhood home in Northern Virginia.I still love to wander, only now I do it, as often as not, through books. Why merely go to Russia, when you can go to 19th-century Russia, which reminds me that it\u2019s probably time I reread \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov.\u201dThough for all intents and purposes, and with apologies to Cervantes, the English perfected the novel; the art of universally themed and many-chaptered storytelling got an early start in the Middle East when the Jews composed and codified the Hebrew Bible. It should come as no surprise that the original \u201cPeople of the Book\u201d live in places where there are seemingly as many bookstores as there are falafel stands \u2014 and because I go to Israel often to visit family, I\u2019ve gotten to know my way around them.In Jerusalem\u2019s religious neighborhoods, there are endless hole-in-the-wall bookstores selling religious texts, in Hebrew, German, Aramaic and Yiddish; even if you have no interest in reading the works of the lesser Hasidic rebbes, you can breathe in some weird essence of the long-ago and far away.I know they\u2019re heavy and take up space in your suitcase and can sometimes disappoint. But like a passport, books \u2014 and the bookstores where you can sample them \u2014 let you go where you\u2019ve never been before.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Benefits From Market Speed Bumps? The Exchanges", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewSince the election, stock prices have risen sharply on hopes that a wave of pro-growth policies under Donald J. Trump will drive up equity prices even further.But Mr. Trump\u2019s administration will soon face a trend that threatens to move the long-term benefits found in stock markets away from investors and toward exchanges.Because IEX planned to delay incoming and outgoing information to the broader market by 350 microseconds each way, the Securities and Exchange Commission was forced to reinterpret a key provision of Reg NMS to approve IEX\u2019s application. In particular, the agency declared any inbound or outbound delay less than one millisecond (1,000 microseconds) to be \u201cde minimis\u201d \u2014 or irrelevant and not harmful to investors.Unfortunately, this trend is emerging. The New York Stock Exchange introduced a so-called discretionary pegged order type to compete with IEX. The Nasdaq stock market has also proposed a new extended-life order.Yet the plan that should cause the most concern for investors is a new speed bump proposed by the Chicago Stock Exchange.First, it\u2019s discriminatory. The Chicago exchange delay would be felt only by those buying a stock posted by market makers. The time advantage for market makers provides them a \u201clast look\u201d that allows them to withdraw their offer if the price is moving in an unfavorable direction based on information obtained outside the Chicago exchange. Moreover, the capacity of market makers to actively update their quotes during the delay means the price for those trying to buy the stock may no longer exist.Second, this ability for market makers to back away from their offer at any time would most likely increase downward price pressure when markets are under stress. As additional exchanges adopt similar quotes to compete, the effects of so-called disappearing quotes on price pressure would intensify.The Chicago Stock Exchange argues that fast traders are driving market makers away from its exchange. Yet, the same study on the TSX Alpha Exchange found the speed bumps \u201cincrease profits for liquidity providers on TSX Alpha but negatively impact aggregate liquidity.\u201dIn total, this proposal will lead to more revenue for market makers and the Chicago Stock Exchange at the expense of investors.After all, if a delay of less than a millisecond is truly \u201cde minimis,\u201d any 350-microsecond delay, no matter how it\u2019s applied, should not harm markets or their participants.Yet, IEX\u2019s delay structure gives an advantage to hidden pegged orders, while the Chicago exchange\u2019s proposal creates advantages for market makers. That different venues can use the same delay to manipulate markets in favor of their own order types underlies my original concerns about the IEX precedent and the millisecond rule.The Securities and Exchange Commission has two options. It could decide to treat IEX as a pilot of the millisecond rule and issue a moratorium on any new delays until the commission can assess the impacts. Or, the agency could issue additional clarifying guidelines for the use of delays to minimize potential abuse.Otherwise, I fear the millisecond rule might be the tool that actually rigs markets in favor of individual exchanges while undermining the broader market and increasing costs and lowering returns for investors.If a Trump stock market boom keeps going, a Trump S.E.C. should ensure that investors benefit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kylie Jenner and the Year of the Drop", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe Year in Style 2016Last Friday, on a sunny December morning, chaos descended upon a glossy shopping mall in the Canoga Park section of Los Angeles.Thousands of young women (and a few men), many of whom had slept in the parking lot of the Westfield Topanga mall overnight or traveled from several states away, surged en masse at 10 a.m. toward a monochrome, recently erected temporary store on the first floor. Hours later, most shoppers were still there, waiting in snaking lines and shrieking intermittently. Others, their eyes downcast, tapped on smartphones.\u201cThe empire, it\u2019s all for you,\u201d Ms. Jenner said as she arrived to open her store, part of which she designed herself by taking inspiration from the bedroom of her mansion in Calabasas, Calif. (imagine a gigantic bed with white sheets, a pink neon autograph on black walls and video installation of Ms. Jenner in lingerie and a fur coat rolling around in bed with her rapper boyfriend, Tyga). She waved and blew kisses \u2014 the scene was streamed on Snapchat \u2014 before taking a few selfies with fans. Pandemonium ensued.[See more Year in Style articles]\u201cIn the e-commerce age, older consumers have shown that they want ease, convenience and plenty of variety from their shopping experience,\u201d said Avery Booker, the chief executive of Enflux, a digital influence-mining tool. But, he said, when it comes to Generation Z, those born in the years from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, and the younger millennials, \u201cin many cases the opposite is emerging.\u201d\u201cThey are excited not just by a product\u2019s rarity,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut also by what credibility owning that product can give them within their social media communities, as well as its possible resale value.\u201dThe flourishing secondary markets, fueled by online resellers and prompted by the growing clout of drop culture, has been one of the most significant changes to the retail landscape in recent years. Mere hours after the latest Kylie Lip Kit, Supreme sneaker or H&M/Alexander Wang piece has sold out on official distribution channels, these items are often available elsewhere on the internet, though with one or more zeros added to the price. For savvier fans, the use of auto-fillers or bots to skip the digital lines for valuable items is increasing.Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of the innovation group at advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, said Generation Z was far more entrepreneurial than its predecessors.\u201cIf millennials are digitally savvy, then Generation Z are total digital natives,\u201d Ms. Greene said. \u201cThey are completely au fait with the internet and social media platforms, and comfortable using them to create anything from fan forums to charities and their own minibusinesses. Their identities are defined by their interactions and relationships online, both with one another and celebrities.\u201cThat\u2019s why stars like Kylie Jenner, who interact with them like peers on the mediums they feel most comfortable with rather than more traditional retail platforms, are seeing such astronomical success.\u201dSome independent businesses are also recognizing new opportunities to profit and are building new services accordingly. Depop, which was started in Britain in 2012, is a buying, selling and swapping app for clothes, accessories and other wares. It created communities of influencers and like-minded shoppers and has strong roots in the resale market. Eighty percent of its user base is under 30.\u201cBrands like Supreme and Palace really understand successful 21st-century branding and how to appeal to younger consumers from the selfie generation,\u201d said Maria Raga, the chief executive of Depop. \u201cThere is no question that our business is capitalizing on their success. Many of the most successful resellers to emerge out of the drop culture don\u2019t just see what they do as a way of making money. They see it as a way of building their own brand. They can gain huge profiles and followings in their own right.\u201dIt\u2019s not necessarily in their nature to save the earnings from transactions either. \u201cTo keep up their social media credentials, Generation Z feel they need to change their clothing much quicker than shoppers in their late 20s upward,\u201d Ms. Raga said. \u201cPlus there is always a hot new pricey brand on the up. Most of them are students. They aren\u2019t really earning money yet. So to buy more, they need to keep selling stuff.\u201dCharles Fitchew, a 13-year-old in Manchester, England, is one example. He said he did 95 percent of his shopping online, with the traditional majority of any new purchases coming from drops. Lately, however, he said a growing number now came from transactions that took place on Facebook messenger chat groups, particularly for sneaker resales, which tend to be dominated by young men. (No surprise: Kylie Jenner\u2019s sales are predominantly driven by teenage girls and women in their 20s.)\u201cThese days, if you want the coolest stuff you have three options,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can queue up overnight outside a store before a drop or hope for the best online. You can go to an established site if you miss out or can\u2019t be bothered to wait, like eBay or Depop, but expect to pay double the original price. Or you can go on Snapchat or a Facebook Talk group, get a better bargain and really be able to ask questions about the quality and condition of what\u2019s being sold.\u201d\u201cIf it isn\u2019t up to scratch, then the seller gets kicked out by the rest of the community,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s how things work at our age. The best things should never be easy to get, otherwise what\u2019s their value? To be honest, I can\u2019t really imagine things being any other way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman President Named Trump Adviser, Opening Door for Younger Executives", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byThe jockeying to be the next chief executive of Goldman Sachs is expected to intensify after President-elect Donald J. Trump officially asked the firm\u2019s president, Gary D. Cohn, to become his top economic policy adviser on Monday.Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure from the top ranks of the Wall Street firm removes a crucial impediment for the next generation of Goldman leaders because he was seen as the natural heir to the top spot. Mr. Cohn is among a handful of senior executives who have held sway atop Goldman since before the financial crisis, and he is among the last of them to leave, even as Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman, seems in no hurry to step down.Goldman is expected to announce a new slate of deputies to Mr. Blankfein in coming days, including the naming of two co-presidents \u2014 a role Mr. Cohn initially shared with Jon Winkelried until the latter\u2019s departure in 2009.Goldman named 84 new partners this year, more than its previous partner class two years ago. Wall Street banks have been constrained by new regulations cutting into big businesses, such as trading, and pinching profit margins \u2014 reasons Goldman has been expanding into new areas like consumer banking.The firm is moving into the future with the wind at its back, after several years spent battling the financial crisis and the regulations that arose from it, which generally hit Goldman harder than other banks.During the presidential campaign, it looked as if the pressure on Goldman would continue. Mr. Trump blasted Hillary Clinton for her ties to the firm and hinted in ominous tones about the company\u2019s outsize role in shaping the country\u2019s policy.But since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, he has looked to Goldman Sachs veterans to stock his administration. In addition to the appointment of Mr. Cohn, the former Goldman executive Steven Mnuchin was tapped as Treasury secretary, and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a Goldman alumnus.Mr. Trump has also talked about rolling back the financial regulations that have reined in Goldman\u2019s famous trading operations in recent years and crimped its profits.In addition, the anticipation of big spending programs by the government under Mr. Trump has helped to push interest rates up, which generally helps financial firms like Goldman.Most banks have had their stocks rise since the election, but Goldman\u2019s shares have experienced immense gains, rising by nearly a third since early November.He added: \u201cToday, for a variety of reasons, capital and regulatory reasons, the competitive landscape has changed pretty dramatically. And we\u2019re as uniquely positioned as we ever have been in the competitive landscape.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s transition team officially announced on Monday that Mr. Cohn would be his assistant on economic policy and the director of his National Economic Council, a move that had been expected since last Friday.\u201cAs my top economic adviser, Gary Cohn is going to put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe fully understands the economy and will use all of his vast knowledge and experience to make sure the American people start winning again.\u201dMr. Cohn has been with Goldman Sachs since 1990 and rose up as a trader alongside Mr. Blankfein.\u201cGary and I have been partners for more than 25 years, so I know better than perhaps anyone that he has the intelligence, commitment and experience to be successful at any endeavor he undertakes,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said in a statement on Monday.In his own statement, Mr. Cohn said, \u201cI share President-elect Trump\u2019s vision of making sure every American worker has a secure place in a thriving economy, and we will be completely committed to building a nation of strength, growth and prosperity.\u201dMr. Cohn is a particularly unlikely choice for the Trump administration because he has been a registered Democrat and has, in public appearances, reflected the sort of internationalist view of the economy that Mr. Trump has often criticized.At a conference in Florida soon after the election, Mr. Cohn said the big problem facing the country and the world was a \u201cglobal growth issue.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve it with domestic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201dThe job that Mr. Cohn is expected to accept has long been identified with Goldman and its influence in the capital.The role of N.E.C. director was established by President Bill Clinton and given to Robert E. Rubin, Goldman\u2019s co-chairman at the time. Stephen Friedman, who served as co-chairman with Mr. Rubin, later held the economic adviser position under President George W. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Weather Italy Referendum Result, but Banks Are Vulnerable", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byStocks in Europe and the United States rose, and the euro recovered from early losses \u2014 a reaction that was muted in part because opinion polls had predicted the \u201cno\u201d vote, giving investors time to adjust their portfolios, and also because political instability in Rome is not exactly unusual.But analysts said the potential for market turmoil remained if the vote resulted in a long period of government paralysis and delayed plans to fix Italy\u2019s ailing banks, whose shares fell sharply on Monday.\u201cIt will be very much related to two factors,\u201d said Nicola Nobile, a senior European economist at Oxford Economics in Milan. \u201cWhat is going to happen to the banking system, and if we\u2019re going to have a government soon.\u201dThe vote was another sign of popular resistance across Europe to changes that economists say are needed for the 19-country eurozone to overcome problems that have threatened its existence. Such overhauls are particularly urgent in Italy, which has had no lasting growth for a decade and is the second-most-indebted country in the eurozone after Greece.The European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council, which is scheduled to meet on Thursday, is expected to extend its purchases of eurozone government bonds to hold down borrowing rates. But analysts say that central bank measures cannot keep the currency bloc together indefinitely if its members are unwilling to take steps that are essential to growth.The political uncertainty caused by the vote will postpone plans to rebuild Italian banks and to help them deal with problem loans, which account for nearly a fifth of total debt and are a serious drag on the economy.Though market interest rates, or yields, on government bonds rose across Europe \u2014 indicating that investors now consider the region to be a riskier place to put their money \u2014 the increase was highest in Italy, a sign of the heightened uncertainty over the country\u2019s prospects. American Treasuries followed European bonds lower, sending yields up.After the vote, the euro initially fell as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading, but it recovered by the morning in Europe and even gained ground compared with last week. Major European and United States stock markets were all slightly higher as well.Political instability will make it even more difficult than it already was for Monte dei Paschi to raise the 5 billion euros, or $5.3 billion, it needs to clean up its portfolio of bad loans. Mr. Renzi\u2019s government had been trying to encourage reluctant investors to put up the money.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.In the worst-case scenario, the bank would not be able to raise the money and there would be a so-called bail-in of the lender in which shareholders, bondholders and depositors would bear the losses.\u201cThat would be quite painful for the banking system,\u201d Mr. Nobile said. \u201cThe negative reaction would not just be with Monte dei Paschi.\u201dShares in Monte dei Paschi were down 3.5 percent in afternoon trading while the shares of UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, fell 6 percent before paring some of the losses.UniCredit has scheduled an investor presentation for next week and had been expected to outline plans to raise more capital. The timing of the presentation now looks unfortunate.Problems at Italian banks could spread across the eurozone. Large banks around the Continent continually lend money to one another, which allows problems at one institution to spread quickly.European banks have lent \u20ac385 billion to Italian banks, or slightly less than 2 percent of total credit, according to analysts at Credit Suisse. BNP Paribas of France is the most vulnerable, with just under 10 percent of its outstanding loans in Italy. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank in Germany have about 3 percent of their credit portfolios in Italy, according to Credit Suisse, which said the sums are not large enough to undermine the eurozone banking system.However, history shows that the extent of banks\u2019 exposure to one another does not usually become clear until a large lender gets in trouble.In the worst case, Italy could again be at the center of a crisis like the one that nearly destroyed the eurozone in 2011. The vote could set off a political chain reaction leading to a government headed by the populist Five Star Movement.\u201cThe risk in Italy is that a Five Star party-led government is coming next, and it will move to pull Italy out of the E.U.,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cThat prospect undermines the creditworthiness proposition underlying Italian bonds.\u201dThere is danger of a vicious circle if the Italian economy sags. More businesses and consumers would have trouble paying their debts, and the number of problem loans could rise further. Bad loans are a dead weight on the Italian economy, because they prevent banks from providing credit needed for businesses to expand. And problems at Italian banks would become even more intractable.Italy\u2019s national debt is equal to 136 percent of gross domestic product. The government depends on investors willing to continue rolling over the debt at reasonable interest rates.Investors have already been demanding a higher premium on Italian bonds. The yield on Italian 10-year government bonds has nearly doubled since August, to around 2 percent. That is still far below the more than 7 percent reached in late 2011, during the darkest days of the eurozone financial crisis. But the increase is a sign that investors consider the bonds to be more risky.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Play the Trump Stock Market Rally", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byFundamentally\u201cIf you have big tax cuts and more infrastructure and defense spending, that adds to demand, which is likely to spell inflation,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds.That is partly why shares of big banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase and blue-chip industrial companies like Caterpillar and General Dynamics have surged since election night.But after more than a month of this rally, value-minded investors think it may be time to start looking for bargains in areas of the market that have been left behind.\u201cThe biggest opportunity is in the international markets,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \u201cThose stocks are getting pounded by one big factor \u2014 the dollar.\u201dA strong dollar not only reduces the value of gains that Americans enjoy on their overseas investments, but it also serves as a headwind to domestic companies as a strengthening currency makes their goods more expensive to foreign buyers.In the immediate aftermath of the election, the dollar surged as much as 4 percent against a basket of foreign currencies, on the belief that market interest rates in the United States would keep rising and the Federal Reserve would start lifting short-term rates, too. Both moves would provide greater incentives for global investors to park their cash in dollar-denominated assets.But Mr. Paulsen looked at the start of the last five periods in which the Federal Reserve began a sustained campaign to raise short-term rates. \u201cEvery one of those times was associated with a decline in the dollar,\u201d he said, not a rise.While it\u2019s true that rising bond yields can strengthen the dollar, rates are often raised to stave off inflation, and that can hurt a currency. If the Federal Reserve starts hiking rates this month because it sees a need to quell inflation, that could weaken the dollar, Mr. Paulsen said.\u201cIf the dollar comes down,\u201d he said, \u201cthat definitely brings the foreign markets, particularly the emerging markets, into play.\u201dLewis J. Altfest, chief investment officer for Altfest Personal Wealth Management, concurs with this logic and is adding to his investments in emerging market equities, he said, especially after they\u2019ve taken another hit. Since the Nov. 8 election, emerging market shares such as the Chinese internet giant Tencent have fallen, while a broad range of shares in the American market have gained.Historically, emerging market stocks have traded at roughly a 15 percent discount to United States shares based on price/earnings ratios that rely on five years of averaged profits, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group.Today, that has widened to a near 50 percent discount.Emerging market stocks weren\u2019t the only investments that had taken a hit because of rising interest rates lately.In the aftermath of the election, the yield on 10-year Treasuries jumped to 2.4 percent, while 30-year Treasury yields rose to 3.1 percent. Both are up a full percentage point from their levels this summer, which helps to explain why the average long-term government bond mutual fund fell more than 7 percent in the month after the election.In any case, bond investors may have overreacted in selling.The same goes for Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s speculation about new longer-dated bonds. It could take years for the Treasury to actually issue such bonds, Ms. Jones said, and as that realization takes hold and selling slows down, there may be some short-term opportunities in Treasuries, she added.Investors may want to consider sectors that have underperformed during this postelection surge, even if they haven\u2019t declined.Take technology. American tech stocks haven\u2019t moved much since election night.Why? Conventional wisdom said that the new president\u2019s views on immigration and trade would hurt tech companies the most, in part because these firms generate a greater portion of their sales overseas \u2014 58 percent \u2014 than any other sector of the market, according to FactSet, a financial research firm.But Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank, said the Trump administration\u2019s incipient economic goals appear to be threefold. \u201cThe first is to grow the economic pie, and then to widen the slices of both wages for workers and profits for companies,\u201d he said.To accomplish that, the economy would need to increase productivity. \u201cUltimately, business investment has to be part of the solution, and because of that, tech will be critical,\u201d Mr. Ablin added.This may not directly help consumer-focused companies like Apple, \u201cbut this should be good news to tech companies that sell to other businesses, like Salesforce.com,\u201d Mr. Ablin said.Health care is another fertile area to consider, market strategists say. While big pharmaceutical companies rallied immediately after the election \u2014 on the assumption that a Trump administration will relax regulations \u2014 other parts of the sector have been largely flat on uncertainties surrounding the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Medical equipment stocks, for instance, have slumped on fears that if Obamacare is eliminated and fewer Americans are insured, hospitals will purchase less new equipment.\u201cHealth care is an interesting area postelection because there is still so much uncertainty about Obamacare,\u201d said Mary L. Pierson, co-manager of Fairpointe Capital\u2019s mid-cap stock strategy.Yet Ms. Pierson noted that some equipment makers are likely to grow with or without Obamacare, citing Varian Medical Systems, an equipment manufacturer based in Palo Alto, Calif., that makes devices for radiotherapy used in treating various forms of cancer. The company generates more than 50 percent of its revenues overseas. What\u2019s more, nearly 95 percent of all radiotherapy equipment installations over the next decade are expected to be handled by just two firms \u2014 Varian and its rival, Elekta.Ms. Pierson sees Varian\u2019s mediocre postelection performance as \u201can opportunity for us to add to our position.\u201dPaul J.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Win Gives Stocks in Private Prison Companies a Reprieve", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byStrategiesAs terrific as Donald J. Trump has been for the stock market, he has been absolutely spectacular for a troubled niche: companies that run for-profit prisons and immigration detention centers for states and the federal government.So Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory represented a radical change in fortunes for them \u2014 a boon for investors and a potential nightmare for critics. \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme case of politics affecting the stock market,\u201d said Ryan Meliker, a senior analyst with Canaccord Genuity. \u201cPolitics drove down the shares of the companies over the summer \u2014 and now the situation is reversed.\u201dThese two companies, both real estate investment trusts, are not household names. In fact, on Nov. 10, Corrections Corporation of America changed its trading name to CoreCivic. According to Jonathan Burns, a company spokesman, the move was part of a long-planned rebranding that emphasizes diversification into areas like inmate transportation and residential re-entry programs for former inmates.But that market had appeared to be shrinking. Investors shunned the two companies over the summer when the Obama administration signaled its displeasure. A Justice Department memo concluded that privately operated prisons were inferior to those operated directly by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in three critical areas: They do not provide comparable services, do not save substantially on costs and do not maintain \u201cthe same level of safety and security.\u201dPrivate prisons began a resurgence in the United States in the 1980s with the law-and-order, privatization and anti-union campaigns of the Reagan revolution. They helped ease overcrowding in state and then federal prisons as inmate populations swelled, while budgets were constrained.On Aug. 18, Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, said in that Justice Department memo that the Federal Bureau of Prisons was \u201cbeginning the process of reducing \u2014 and ultimately ending \u2014 our use of privately operated prisons.\u201d The memo was a bombshell: In one day, shares of CoreCivic (then Corrections Corporation of America) fell 35.5 percent. GEO dropped 40 percent.From a purely financial standpoint, that horrendous market decline may have been an overreaction.Even as the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that it was ending a contract with CoreCivic to house inmates in Cibola County, N.M., CoreCivic promptly got a new contract to run the same center on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The Obama administration\u2019s approach is \u201can inconsistent revolving door policy,\u201d Carl Takei, staff attorney for the national prison project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said. The A.C.L.U. objects to private prisons as a matter of principle, he said, adding that they engage in \u201cprofiteering.\u201d\u201cThese companies by their nature depend on and profit from mass incarceration,\u201d Mr. Takei said.Pablo Paez, a spokesman for GEO, said in an email: \u201cWe do not believe in cost-cutting for profit sake as critics like the A.C.L.U. contend, instead we believe in running an efficient operation that provides adequate staffing and relies on state of the art technology for monitoring, communication and health care.\u201dMr. Burns of CoreCivic said in an interview, \u201cWe have played a pivotal role in improving the conditions and environment for many inmates in many states, and we continue to do that.\u201dOliver Hart, the Harvard professor who is one of this year\u2019s Nobel laureates in economic science, has problems with for-profit prisons for other reasons. The difficulty is not just that the companies\u2019 profit incentives don\u2019t entirely align with civic interests, he said in an interview.\u201cThere is a problem in contracts that we call residual control,\u201d he said. While it\u2019s relatively easy to shift a public service like garbage collection to private companies, he said, it\u2019s not reasonable to do so for some government functions, like decision-making in foreign policy.\u201cYou don\u2019t want private contractors to have ultimate control over use of violence,\u201d Professor Hart said.\u201cPrisons are somewhere in the middle\u201d between garbage collecting and decision-making on war and peace, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s generally better not to privatize prisons.\u201dBut the market has concluded that the business may have its best days ahead of it.\u201cThe outlook for the companies really changed overnight with the election of Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Dwyer of KDP Investment Advisors said.The new administration\u2019s policies are not clear, but Mr. Trump\u2019s statements have been starkly different from those of President Obama \u2014 and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who each called for the end of private prisons.The implications for investors are clear, he added: \u201cThere is a big upside for these companies.\u201dTwitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cashing In on Climate Change", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byYou\u2019ve saved your money and amassed a surplus. You\u2019ve read a few books on investing and gleaned the basics \u2014 the importance of diversification, of investing for the long term, and of buying and holding rather than trying to beat the market. But you also know that human-caused climate change will (if it hasn\u2019t already) start eroding economic output. Extreme weather, droughts and crop failures could mean mass migration and political instability. As Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, recently put it, the \u201cgreenhouse-gas crisis\u201d won\u2019t burst like the housing bubble of 2008 because \u201cclimate change is more subtle and cruel.\u201dWhat\u2019s a climate-aware investor to do?Individuals aren\u2019t the only ones contemplating this question. Sixty-nine percent of Fortune 500 companies reported more demand for \u201clow carbon\u201d products this year, according to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project. And some of the country\u2019s largest pension funds, including the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System and New York State\u2019s retirement fund, have begun tilting away from fossil fuels.This approach has been called \u201csocially responsible investing.\u201d But these days, money managers aren\u2019t doing it only because they think it\u2019s morally correct; they also worry that, over the long term, fossil fuels are a losing bet.Some experts told me that the historic accord on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions reached in Paris last year was a turning point in how investors think about climate change. The United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest emitters, ratified it in September. It\u2019s now unclear what will happen to the agreement; President-elect Donald J. Trump has said he wants to pull the United States out of it.But it\u2019s worth noting that business interests \u2014 and Mr. Trump sells himself as a consummate businessman \u2014 were integral to making the Paris deal happen in the first place. They realize that \u201cenvironmental stability is absolutely at the base of financial stability,\u201d Christiana Figueres, the diplomat who organized the conference, told me. Extreme weather, like the 2011 monsoon floods that ravaged parts of South Asia where electronic components that go into hard disks and cars are built, have driven that lesson home.Something more hopeful is happening as well. Renewable energy prices have dropped, and are nearly competitive with fossil fuels. China aims to build enough charging stations to power five million electric cars by 2020. What will happen, Ms. Figueres asked, if China phases out the combustion engine altogether? \u201cYou can begin to see the signals,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tide is beginning to change.\u201dAdvances in battery technology are part of this change. The wind doesn\u2019t blow all the time, nor does the sun shine all day. Energy produced intermittently needs to be stored. A lack of easy storage options has been an obstacle to renewables. But battery costs have declined by more than 70 percent since 2008. Mark Fulton, a founding partner of Energy Transition Advisors, says that what\u2019s about to happen with the battery and renewables is an old-fashioned technological disruption story, akin to the advent of the internet. From an investor\u2019s standpoint, this kind of disruption could mean losing your shirt or, if you plan properly, handsome returns.One of the myths around socially responsible investing is that aligning investments with ethics means lower returns. But that\u2019s not the case. George Serafeim, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, and his colleagues analyzed data going back over 20 years. Companies that were committed to sustainability outperformed companies that weren\u2019t, they found. A dollar invested in sustainability-minded companies in 1993 would have grown to $22.58 by 2014, but just $15.35 if invested in companies with no such commitments. Why might this emphasis increase profits? These firms may also be more likely to invest in human capital and be better run overall.But even if you divest, says Jean Rogers, chief executive of the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, there\u2019s no escaping the ripple effects of climate change. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so ubiquitous, it\u2019s very hard to diversify away from climate risk,\u201d she told me.Another approach is a kind of divestment lite. Asha Mehta, director of responsible investing at Acadian Asset Management, told me that her clients increasingly request a \u201cdecarbonization\u201d of their portfolios. Worried that complete divestment might hobble a portfolio\u2019s performance, however, Ms. Mehta might reduce a portfolio\u2019s carbon footprint to, say, 80 percent of a benchmark like the S.&P. 500 by removing the biggest emitters. A firm called Osmosis Investment Management takes a different tack. It researches the overall efficiency of companies \u2014 how many resources a firm uses to create how much product. And instead of excluding certain industries entirely, Osmosis chooses only the most efficient within a given sector. It caters to institutional investors, but plans to release a fund for individuals soon.You can, of course, try to do what Osmosis does on your own; the Carbon Disclosure Project has a trove of information on how companies fare on the sustainability front. But here\u2019s the problem. More than 5,600 corporations disclose sustainability information, but no standards govern these disclosures. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and others are working to devise such standards. Pressure is also mounting on the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the disclosure of sustainability information. The commission recently asked for feedback on reforming the disclosure process, and a good chunk of letters mentioned sustainability and climate change.Under a Trump administration, it seems less likely that the S.E.C. will respond to these concerns. But that may have a paradoxical effect: If investors can\u2019t count on regulators to enforce transparency on sustainability, says Sonia Kowal, the president of Zevin Asset Management, they may take matters into their own hands.So if you\u2019re concerned about how climate issues might damage your nest egg, you might begin by raising your voice. Ask your fund managers about their plans. And look at how the funds you own vote on sustainability-related issues, such as whether to calculate and disclose a company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, or whether to develop a risk-assessment plan for climate change.Does that make you an activist? \u201cThe word I prefer is \u2018investor advocate,\u2019 \u201d Jackie Cook, who operates Fund Votes, told me. \u201cYou\u2019re advocating for your own investments.\u201dFor many, the perceived gap between socially responsible investing and good business has narrowed almost to the point of convergence. And maybe that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. A Citi report from last year put the costs of climate change, without mitigation, at $44 trillion by 2060. Many analysts have pointed out that a yearslong drought preceded the conflict in Syria \u2014 an example of how shifting climate can encourage political instability that ripples around the world. And this year, a report from the World Economic Forum said that the No. 1 global risk in the next 10 years was water crises. Nos. 2 and 3 were climate adaptation failure and extreme weather.The economy can be only as healthy as the planet that houses it. Pushing for transparency on sustainability issues, and asking money managers to consider climate change, is really the purest form of self-interest.Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Disease,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Earlier this year, Xu Caiyuan watched helplessly as the numbers flashed across a computer screen in his office in Shanghai\u2019s glittering financial district.\u201cDuring the stock market plunge, many middle-class investors lost their money, and they don\u2019t know why,\u201d Mr. Xu, 38, said over lunch in a Southeast Asian restaurant overlooking a park in Shanghai\u2019s French Concession. \u201cThe reason the market plummeted is because this is a man-made disaster.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a human factor behind the stock market crash,\u201d he added. \u201cThe crash took me by surprise. I thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t normal.\u2019\u201dIn person, Mr. Xu does not look like a legal brawler. A slim, short man, he showed up to lunch wearing hip glasses and a navy suit with white dots. But as he pulled out documents related to his lawsuit and spoke about them in sharp bursts, his combative side became evident.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there will be justice, but I can choose to do things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason we appealed to the courts is we trust in the courts and the legal system.\u201dMr. Xu had already achieved some prominence in financial circles as an activist investor, known for bringing lawsuits against companies he had invested in that he thought had failed to act in the best interests of shareholders.His attempt to sue the C.S.R.C. after the January 2016 crash was different, because he was taking on the government. A lower court and a high court rejected the lawsuit this year, despite the news media coverage. In October, he filed an appeal with the Supreme People\u2019s Court, hoping the judges would force a lower court to hear the case.He has been traveling between Shanghai and Beijing all year to deal with the courts, and now awaits an answer.Zhang Ren, a lawyer at the Beijing Century Law Firm who has been advising Mr. Xu, said the government\u2019s attempts to ignore Mr. Xu\u2019s lawsuit \u201care embarrassing.\u201d\u201cAnd the Intermediate Court\u2019s negligence is embarrassing, too,\u201d he added, referring to a lower court in Beijing that rejected Mr. Xu\u2019s lawsuit.Mr. Zhang said the case was one that could be a legal marker. \u201cWhen China becomes more democratic and respects the rule of law, this could be a precedent,\u201d he said.Another lawyer, Liang Min, disagreed, saying Mr. Xu was pushing a \u201csensationalistic\u201d case with no basis in proper administrative law.Mr. Xu comes from Wenzhou, in Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, known as a hotbed of entrepreneurship. The youngest of three children, Mr. Xu attended Huadong Normal University in Shanghai, where he studied management. He said he began investing in stocks in 1998, even before he had graduated.\u201cAt the time, I would look through the financial reports and annual reports of listed companies and make decisions,\u201d he said.AFTER graduation, he worked several years as a university administrator, then became a full-time investor and eventually started a company to manage investment funds. He now has a small office in the Lujiazui neighborhood, the center of Shanghai\u2019s financial industry.He manages two private equity funds, both named after him: Caiyuan No. 1 and Caiyuan No. 2. He belongs to a Wenzhou business association in Shanghai \u2014 it is common for Wenzhou entrepreneurs to band together in cities where they live \u2014 and to an investors\u2019 group in Lujiazui.Mr. Xu said that the funds weathered the market crashes and that his lawsuit was tied solely to his personal investments. He declined to say how much money he lost in the market turmoil, but said some friends had lost the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars.Mr. Xu became a public figure in 2008, when he led a shareholder suit against Gangfan, a state-owned steel company based in Sichuan Province that was undergoing restructuring, accusing it of wrongly failing to buy back stock warrants held by investors. A local court ruled in favor of the shareholders. The central government agency in charge of state-owned enterprises then ordered Gangfan to pay the investors 7 billion renminbi, or more than $1 billion.The victory made news. Since then, Mr. Xu has brought a half-dozen similar lawsuits. In 2010, he was named a \u201cWenzhou Economic Figure\u201d by Wenzhou Economic Newspaper for his efforts to protect shareholders\u2019 rights.\u201cSome of the listed companies, when they see me, they avoid me like the plague,\u201d he said. \u201cA regulatory body, for example the C.S.R.C., it has headaches.\u201dNot all of the lawsuits have been successful. He failed in an attempt to sue a pharmaceuticals company in Inner Mongolia with large property holdings \u2014 \u201cThis company was set to be a big enterprise in Inner Mongolia, so I think it had influence,\u201d he said.Police officers in Inner Mongolia called Mr. Xu to question him over the telephone. Officers in Shanghai did the same.Through the years, Mr. Xu has continued investing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an opportunist,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always invested based on the value of the companies.\u201dThe case Mr. Xu is trying to make against the China Securities Regulatory Commission is not an easy one. Mr. Xu said he believed the market crashed in part because state-owned enterprises sold large holdings and withdrew from the market under cover from the agency, which reassured people that big investors were staying in the market.He also said the C.S.R.C. had issued a statement called Document No. 21, in which its head, Mr. Xiao, said that a large state securities company would keep up its investments to stabilize the market. That turned out not to be true, Mr. Xu said \u2014 in reality, the company and other state-owned enterprises sold off stocks.The C.S.R.C. spokesman did not respond to multiple calls made to his office on Friday seeking comment.Mr. Xu also tried to file a second lawsuit against the agency, this one accusing the agency of not disclosing information properly. The First Intermediate Court accepted the case in September, but then last month reversed itself. Mr. Xu said he was also appealing that decision.\u201cI think Wenzhou people are very persistent,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cThey can endure hardship. They don\u2019t surrender to failure.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect dollar equivalency for the 7 billion renminbi that Gangfan was ordered to pay investors. It equals more than $1 billion, not $100 million.Kiki Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Problems With China\u2019s Financial System, Add the Bond Market", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byNow another fast-growing part of China\u2019s vast and increasingly complicated financial market is showing signs of distress: its $9 trillion bond market.Prices for government and corporate bonds have tumbled over the past week, a sell-off that continued on Tuesday. The situation has spooked investors, prompting the government to temporarily restrain some trading and to make emergency loans to struggling financial institutions.\u201cThe adjustment has not yet finished,\u201d said Miao Zuoxing, a partner at the FXM Brothers Fund, a Shanghai-based investment fund that trades stocks, bonds and futures. \u201cIt will continue and normalize until money is put where the government can see it.\u201dAt least 40 companies have said they would postpone or cancel bond offerings rather than risk being forced to pay high interest rates to sell the bonds \u2014 or being unable to sell them at all. Among them was the Jiangsu Sumec Group Corporation, an industrial trading house that exports items as varied as gardening tools and auto parts; the company said on Thursday that it would not go through with the sale of $130 million in short-term bonds.\u201cDue to recent, relatively large market fluctuations, our company decided to cancel the issue of the current bond,\u201d Jiangsu Sumec Group said in a statement, \u201cand will reissue it at a chosen time.\u201dChina has particular reason to worry. As the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States, it relies on a rickety financial system that is mired in debt and susceptible to hidden stresses. Higher overseas interest rates could also prompt more Chinese investors to move their money out of the country, either to chase higher returns elsewhere or to avoid what some see as China\u2019s growing problems.The outflows are \u201cadding to domestic banking system stresses and weakening the already fragile foundations of the entire financial system,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University who was formerly chief of the China division at the International Monetary Fund.A healthy bond market is crucial to China\u2019s restructuring plans. The country has been counting on its fast-growing bond market as one way to bring market discipline to its traditionally state-directed \u2014 and wasteful \u2014 economy.In the mature financial system of the United States, businesses have plenty of ways to get money. They can borrow from a bank, raise money selling stocks or bonds, or seek funds directly from any number of investors.But in China, state-run banks are by far the main source of funding. That helped power the country\u2019s economic rise, but it also led to loans going to politically connected borrowers rather than to where the economy needed it most. That is one reason the Chinese economy is now stuck with more steel, glass, cement and auto factories than it needs.Particularly in the past two years, China has taken steps to encourage the development of robust stock and bond markets as well as private lenders, needing a way to ensure the flow of money was being directed by profit-minded investors rather than politicians and their allies at state-owned banks.The stock market crashed last year, and private lending has been slow to take off. But until this past week, the bond market had performed well. The investment arms of local governments and other large borrowers rushed in recent months to issue bonds at low interest rates and to pay off bank loans issued at higher rates \u2014 just as the government intended. Bond issuance jumped 47 percent in the first 11 months of this year from the same period last year.What the government did not foresee was an explosion of speculative bond trading by Chinese banks.Still, it is becoming increasingly clear that many of them are backed by bonds. The bond holdings of wealth management products more than doubled over the 18-month period that ended in June. Adding to the risks, banks are also making large, leveraged bets on the direction of bond prices.Now the government is moving to rein it in. On Monday evening, The Financial News, a newspaper controlled by China\u2019s central bank, published questions and answers with a central bank official who was identified only as being in charge of the reviews of banks\u2019 financial soundness. The official told the newspaper that starting next year, the central bank would include wealth management products in these reviews.A press officer at the central bank confirmed that the interview was an accurate reflection of the institution\u2019s views but declined to elaborate.On Tuesday, the yield on one-year government bonds rose to 3.11 percent, compared with 2.35 percent two weeks ago, a considerable jump for bonds. Yields go up when bond prices go down, and a higher yield makes it more expensive to issue bonds.Corporate bond yields are also rising fast, as investors have begun demanding a better return from entrusting their money to China\u2019s frequently opaque companies. That reverses a trend from this year, when investors were so enthusiastic for Chinese bonds that they bought corporate bonds as well, narrowing the natural spread between government and corporate bonds.Mr. Miao, of FXM Brothers, predicted that corporate bonds would continue to sell off until the spread between government corporate yields was wider again.\u201cWhen the corporate bubble has burst,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we could say the adjustment is finished.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Investors Join China\u2019s Tycoons in Sending Money Abroad", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byAdam Dahill saw promise in the three-story brownstone on a quiet Bedford-Stuyvesant street, despite its weather-beaten facade, crumbling front steps and broken windows. But he needed nearly $1.3 million to buy it and turn it into the sort of Brooklyn dream home for which the city\u2019s lawyers and bankers pay big money.No problem. For funding, Mr. Dahill borrowed money from a new and eager group of international financiers: middle-class Chinese investors.\u201cI don\u2019t discriminate if someone wants to finance the property we developed,\u201d said the 36-year-old Mr. Dahill, who works as a mortgage broker by day. \u201cChinese? Great. American? Fine. I don\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re interested.\u201dA new generation of smartphone apps and online lending platforms in China and around the world are helping small investors leap legal and language barriers to put their money to work globally. This informal lending network \u2014 which allows Chinese investors to fund overseas projects and buyers \u2014 largely bypasses banks and other traditional sources of funds, bringing money to places as varied as a sports center in Illinois and apartment blocks in Tennessee.\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of resentment,\u201d said Angelo Richardson, a 45-year-old self-described entrepreneur who lives nearby. Mr. Richardson, who has lived in Brooklyn for 24 years, said his monthly rent had nearly doubled to $1,500 from $900 in just two years.These new financial platforms \u201chire really good lawyers,\u201d says Xiaochen Zhang, a co-founder of the advocacy group CrowdFund China Society. \u201cThis is still a gray area, so lawyers play a big role.\u201dZhang Xiaowen, a 36-year-old serial entrepreneur from Jiangsu Province in China, put up about $4,500 that Mr. Dahill tapped on an online lending platform. The deal promised a quick 13 percent return that \u2014 crucially, for Mr. Zhang \u2014 will be paid in American dollars. Mr. Zhang initially invested Chinese renminbi, meaning he is effectively moving part of his wealth offshore.\u201cOtherwise,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, \u201ctransferring money out of the country can be so difficult.\u201dSo far, the new investing channels have largely been unaffected. Mobile apps like Niuniu, Jimubox and Tiger Stocks allow investors to buy and sell foreign stocks from their smartphone. Online portals allow them to pool their money to buy a piece of international real estate outright, or to fund buyers abroad like Mr. Dahill in New York.Unlike other ways China\u2019s wealthy invest abroad, these new services are often priced for ordinary people. Micai, a \u201crobo-adviser\u201d app that also provides online investment services, has an investment threshold of $5,000. Wealth Migrate, a South African crowdfunding platform that was introduced in China this year, is experimenting with $100 real estate investment products.\u201cThe Chinese people have the same needs as other investors,\u201d said Scott Picken, the chief executive of Wealth Migrate. \u201cThey want wealth preservation and peace of mind.\u201dMr. Zhang, the investor who partly backed Mr. Dahill\u2019s property, made his investment through the website of Haitou360, a New York-based investment service with offices in China. Haitou360 \u2014 the Chinese portion means \u201cto throw into the sea\u201d \u2014 then aggregated investments from clients to buy loan packages from well-known American crowdfunding platforms like RealtyMogul and Patch of Land.China limits Chinese currency transfers abroad by individuals to no more than $50,000 worth a year. But Haitou360 structures its investments so that a legal entity essentially acts on behalf of individual investors, bypassing those limits.\u201cWe solve multiple problems \u2014 we manage the risk of overseas real estate investment, and we overcome the capital control limits everyone has,\u201d said Jerry Wang, the chief executive of Haitou360. The structure puts the onus on individual investors to make sure they comply with China\u2019s capital controls, he said.Through these channels, Chinese money has found its way into real estate projects far beyond a few Brooklyn brownstones: homes in New Jersey, medical facilities in Georgia, motel chains. Oversea Crowd, a Chinese private equity firm, has used crowdfunding to raise investments starting at $10,000 from Chinese clients to help fund several luxury student apartments near public universities in Georgia and North Carolina. Their latest apartment complex financed through crowdfunding will soon open near Harvard\u2019s business school.For investors, the returns depend on the period of investment \u2014 sometimes up to five years, other times, only 30 days. On average, longer-term investments have returns of 9 to 11 percent. The company collects an upfront fee, usually equal to a percentage of the investment. Investors receive returns in foreign currency, usually dollars.Before he helped fund Mr. Dahill\u2019s loan for the Brooklyn brownstone, Mr. Zhang, the Haitou360 investor, invested a small amount of money online as a test. Two months later he received a return of a little more than $6, a tiny amount but one that won his trust in online investment.He is now considering a \u201cstudy abroad\u201d investment product that would allow him to begin investing in American real estate immediately. Future returns would be directly transferred monthly to his son, now a child, to pay for tuition and living costs if he were to attend college in the United States.Some on the receiving end of that money flow are looking for ways to deal with it. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Halsey Street is in transition. Down the street from Mr. Dahill\u2019s house, city notices and plywood affixed to brownstones denote more homes under construction. Another house nearby had a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign.Block associations are asking local homeowners to let them know before listing a home so that they can tap nearby residents to find potential buyers.\u201cWe are seeing international investors who are spending money and moving on properties here. It is changing the complexion of the community,\u201d said Tremaine Wright, the chairwoman of Community Board 3, the representative body for Bedford-Stuyvesant. She is a lifelong resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant whose parents and grandparents have also lived in the neighborhood.\u201cBed-Stuy has long been a community of people who owned their homes and resided in their homes,\u201d she added. \u201cNow it\u2019s being changed into a place where a lot of people are investing money and not making a longer-term commitment.\u201dEmily Feng reported from Beijing and Alexandra Stevenson reported from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1MDB Case Hangs Over Goldman Sachs as Investigators Dig for Answers", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byEven as Goldman Sachs is gaining a more prominent profile in the administration of Donald J. Trump, the Wall Street investment firm is undergoing scrutiny in an investigation in a sprawling international money laundering and embezzlement scheme.Prosecutors have said that billions of dollars that Goldman raised for a Malaysian government investment fund \u2014 known as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB \u2014 were channeled into a web of personal bank accounts and was ultimately used to buy paintings, luxury real estate and investment stakes in movies like \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201dInvestigators are now questioning what Goldman knew about the final use of the money.Goldman has said it believed the money was being used to buy legitimate assets for the investment fund, which was run in part by the Malaysian government and its embattled prime minister, Najib Razak.In recent months, lawyers for Goldman have presented information about its dealings with the Malaysian fund to federal prosecutors and the New York Department of Financial Services, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about private meetings.One such meeting took place recently at the Justice Department in Washington. The next meeting is set to take place in Washington in January, the people said.The 1MDB case has become a signature campaign in the global effort by prosecutors to crack down on kleptocracy and the relative ease with which the superwealthy move their money beyond the oversight of government authorities.The Justice Department has been particularly interested in the role that American banks and law firms have played in hiding the assets of the superwealthy.Goldman Sachs and the Justice Department declined to comment.During the campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs for its ties to the global financial elite. But since his election, Mr. Trump has relied heavily on Goldman executives. In addition to Mr. Cohn\u2019s appointment, Mr. Trump has picked a Goldman veteran and hedge fund manager, Steven T. Mnuchin, to be his Treasury Secretary and made another alumnus of the firm, Stephen K. Bannon, his top strategist.The 1MDB case hangs over Goldman at a time when its fortunes are otherwise looking up after many hard years.The firm has faced significant reputational damage after criticism that it profited from the subprime mortgage crisis. The company has also struggled under a raft of new regulations imposed on the financial industry after the mortgage meltdown.But since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, investors have been betting that Mr. Trump will roll back some of the legislation that has hit Goldman particularly hard.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans could also benefit the firm if interest rates rise and banks are able to charge more for loans. Goldman\u2019s shares have shot up more sharply than the broader market and other bank stocks. Since the election, Goldman\u2019s stock price has risen nearly 32 percent.On the international front, a British judge ruled in Goldman\u2019s favor in October after a trial on accusations that the firm had pushed Libya\u2019s sovereign wealth fund into costly, improper investments.In the 1MDB case, there have been no clear signs that the United States government is putting together a criminal case against Goldman or any of its executives.The recent meetings in Washington between Goldman and the Justice Department may have just been an opportunity for the firm to help the government gather material about other targets in the 1MDB investigation, of which there are many. The Federal Reserve is also said to be reviewing the situation.Jack Blum, a lawyer who led corruption investigations for several Senate committees, said that Goldman should have done a thorough investigation of what 1MDB was doing with the money that the bank helped it raise and move around the world, especially given the history of corruption in Malaysia.\u201cIt is a very serious problem when a company is making a hell of a lot of money out of something and everybody in the place says, \u2018I don\u2019t know about it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Blum said.Mr. Blum said that assigning legal blame in situations like the 1MDB case was generally hard because it would be difficult to prove that Goldman executives knew what was going to happen with the money before it happened.Goldman has looked to distance itself from Mr. Leissner, who was at the center of the bank\u2019s relationship with the Malaysian government.Mr. Leissner, who is married to the American fashion designer Kimora Lee Simmons, left Goldman in January after the firm found a letter that Mr. Leissner wrote, on Goldman letterhead, vouching for Jho Low, a close associate of the Malaysian prime minister and a central target of various government investigations.The Journal reported on Thursday that Goldman bankers helped Mr. Low transfer some $3 billion to a small Swiss bank, despite several red flags raised by the Swiss bank and lawyers.The billions of dollars were raised for 1MDB by Goldman in multiple bond transactions that earned the bank outsize fees. The fees were large enough that they needed to get approval from top Goldman executives, including Mr. Cohn, The Journal reported.In June, the New York State Department of Financial Services wrote a letter to Goldman asking for information about the proceeds of the bond sales \u201cincluding, but not limited to, whether any \u2018red flags\u2019 existed concerning such payments.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once an Oil Executive, Now a Crusader Against Fossil Fuel Stocks", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseThe trustees of Cooperstown, N.Y., hardly expected their village (population 1,834) to emerge as a flash point in a national debate over climate change and socially responsible investing.But when they voted in October to divest the pension fund they oversee of all fossil fuel holdings, Cooperstown became the first community in the nation to do so \u2014 not just coal (like Stanford University), but also oil and gas.Just as the divestiture movement has roiled college campuses across the country, pitting environmental activists against college endowment managers, the trustees\u2019 decision caused a stir locally. The town treasurer and tax collector publicly opposed the move, and a village resident took to the local newspaper to suggest the trustees were indulging their personal causes at the expense of prudent portfolio management.The issue has upset the usually tranquil village on the shores of scenic Otsego Lake, which bills itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s hometown\u201d and is home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Talk of carbon neutrality and fiduciary duty has at least temporarily supplanted Donald J. Trump, who easily carried Otsego County.Cooperstown \u201cis abuzz,\u201d said Jim Kevlin, the editor and publisher of the local newspaper, The Freeman\u2019s Journal (founded in 1808 by James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s father) and its companion website, allotsego.com.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten into arguments with a lot of my friends,\u201d said Louis Allstadt, a retired Exxon Mobil executive and town trustee credited with spearheading the divestiture movement (or blamed for it, depending who you ask). \u201cEven at my weekly lunch group.\u201dMr. Allstadt is emerging as something of a small-town hero in the divestiture movement, in part because he has gone full circle on the issue, from managing all of Mobil Oil\u2019s exploration efforts in the United States, Canada and Latin America and helping oversee Mobil\u2019s merger with Exxon during a 31-year career in the industry, to an antifracking, anti-fossil-fuel activist.He has owned a house near Cooperstown since 1973, which served as both a vacation getaway and home base during the years he was based overseas. He moved to the village in 2008 and, after his postretirement conversion, gave over 150 speeches in upstate New York as part of a successful campaign to ban fracking in the state.\u201cIt\u2019s so much worse than the conventional drilling I was familiar with,\u201d he said. \u201cI started talking about how to make it safer, and inevitably someone would ask, \u2018Can you make it safe?\u2019 And basically, the answer is no.\u201dMr. Allstadt ran for town trustee as an independent, with support from both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cI wasn\u2019t running as a \u2018green,\u2019 or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI mostly focus on efficiency and lowering costs.\u201d (There are two independent trustees and four Democrats, which makes Cooperstown something of an anomaly in heavily Republican Otsego County.)Mr. Allstadt is becoming more than a local celebrity. He will be featured next week at a news conference in New York City hosted by the fossil fuel divestment advocacy group Divest-Invest Philanthropy.\u201cCooperstown showed immense leadership in its decision to divest,\u201d said Lindsay Meiman, a spokeswoman for 350.org, the environmental activist group and a supporter of Divest-Invest.But the move sparked immediate opposition outside the environmental movement, starting with the town treasurer and tax collector, Derek Bloomfield, who argued at the trustees meeting in October that energy stocks provided valuable diversification.\u201cSocial investment should be done with one\u2019s own money,\u201d he maintained, according to a report in The Freeman\u2019s Journal, adding that in his view, \u201cfossil fuels have done more to raise mankind out of poverty than any other development through the ages.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve created a great threat to humanity,\u201d Mr. Allstadt shot back.Mr. Allstadt argued that the industry faced insurmountable obstacles in the future and fossil fuel stocks would suffer as a result. \u201cYou don\u2019t just keep driving your car when you see a cliff ahead,\u201d he told The Freeman\u2019s Journal.The discussion \u201cgot a little contentious over the historic merit of fossil fuels,\u201d the mayor, Jeff Katz, told me this week. He and his family were drawn to Cooperstown by its baseball legacy; he has written two books on the topic, including \u201cSplit Season,\u201d about the strike-marred 1981 baseball season.As a former options trader in Chicago, Mr. Katz is also financially sophisticated. He and the trustees oversee a pension fund, with total assets of about $900,000, that benefits the town\u2019s volunteer firefighters and emergency squad. Of that amount, about $140,000 was invested in an S.&.P 500 fund that included fossil fuel stocks. But last year, State Street started an exchange-traded fund that excludes fossil fuels from the S.&P. 500 (the fund\u2019s symbol is SPYX), offering a cost-efficient way to purge fossil fuels from any portfolio.On Oct. 24, the trustees voted unanimously to move to the nonfossil-fuel ETF.\u201cIt\u2019s something people believe in, and we thought it\u2019s a positive way for the name of Cooperstown to be out there,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt\u2019s meaningful in that way. It\u2019s not so meaningful financially. We\u2019re not a $100 million pension fund. No one will suffer if Exxon Mobil triples in the next year.\u201dHe added that he and the trustees didn\u2019t realize Cooperstown would be the first community in the nation to divest itself of all fossil fuels.But the trustees\u2019 decision, and especially Mr. Allstadt\u2019s comments about driving off a cliff, struck a nerve with a village resident, David Russell, who moved with his family to Cooperstown from Westchester County soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Russell is an asset manager who commutes to Manhattan, but he is also steeped in pension fund management as a former counsel to the New York state comptroller H. Carl McCall, who oversaw the state\u2019s vast public retirement plan.\u201cIt\u2019s a very pristine place up here,\u201d Mr. Russell told me this week. \u201cFeelings run very high about the environment. A lot of people went crazy over fracking.\u201d\u201cLou Allstadt went from being a retired oil executive to a pied piper against fossil fuels, which is fine for him personally,\u201d he added. \u201cBut as a trustee, you have to look at this through the lens of fiduciary duty, which means acting in the best interest of the beneficiaries. Village trustees shouldn\u2019t be stock pickers, and they shouldn\u2019t be injecting social issues into the decision.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d never written anything in the paper before,\u201d Mr. Russell said, \u201cbut I felt strongly that someone had to speak up.\u201dSo he drafted a lengthy op-ed for The Freeman\u2019s Journal, arguing that the trustees had a duty to seek the \u201cbest risk-adjusted returns\u201d for the fund and should be \u201cfree from any conflicts of interest or political beliefs/statements.\u201dMr. Russell noted that so far this year, the SPYX fund, minus fossil fuels, had lagged the SPY fund by 16 percent.He added that stock in the two leading firearms manufacturers \u2014 Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger \u2014 which were sold off by many pension funds after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy, have risen 400 percent and 100 percent since then, easily outpacing broad market indexes.\u201cI\u2019m not saying oil stocks are great investments,\u201d Mr. Russell told me. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But no one else does, either.\u201dThis prompted a further exchange of letters from both Mr. Allstadt and Mr. Russell.In his last letter, which ran on Nov. 25, Mr. Allstadt proposed they \u201cgive readers a break,\u201d and \u201ctry to convince one another over a cup of coffee,\u201d an invitation Mr. Russell has so far declined.Though he has not garnered the national attention Mr. Allstadt has, Mr. Russell has attracted his share of local supporters. He said he had gotten many calls and comments from people thanking him for speaking out and urging him to keep doing it. Some have suggested he run for trustee, although \u201cmy wife would divorce me,\u201d he said.Mr. Katz said he had no plans to revisit the decision despite Mr. Russell\u2019s missives. He praised the spirited and sophisticated civic debate, even if it has ruffled a few feathers. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad it\u2019s gotten so personal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty unusual to read that level of discourse in the local weekly. That level of conversation is a credit to the community.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the surname of the former New York state comptroller. He is H. Carl McCall, not McColl.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fish Seek Cooler Waters, Leaving Some Fishermen\u2019s Nets Empty", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byPOINT JUDITH, R.I. \u2014 There was a time when whiting were plentiful in the waters of Rhode Island Sound, and Christopher Brown pulled the fish into his long stern trawler by the bucketful.\u201cWe used to come right here and catch two, three, four thousand pounds a day, sometimes 10,\u201d he said, sitting at the wheel of the Proud Mary \u2014 a 44-footer named, he said, after his wife, not the Creedence Clearwater Revival song \u2014 as it cruised out to sea. But like many other fish on the Atlantic Coast, whiting have moved north, seeking cooler waters as ocean temperatures have risen, and they are now filling the nets of fishermen farther up the coast.Studies have found that two-thirds of marine species in the Northeast United States have shifted or extended their range as a result of ocean warming, migrating northward or outward into deeper and cooler water.Lobster, once a staple in southern New England, have decamped to Maine. Black sea bass, scup, yellowtail flounder, mackerel, herring and monkfish, to name just a few species, have all moved to accommodate changing temperatures.Yet fishing regulations, which among other things set legal catch limits for fishermen and are often based on where fish have been most abundant in the past, have failed to keep up with these geographical changes.The center of the black sea bass population, for example, is now in New Jersey, hundreds of miles north of where it was in the 1990s, providing the basis for regulators to distribute shares of the catch to the Atlantic states.Under those rules, North Carolina still has rights to the largest share. The result is a convoluted workaround many fishermen view as nonsensical. Because black sea bass are now harder to find in their state waters, North Carolina fishermen must steam north 10 hours, to where the fish are abundant, to even approach the state\u2019s allocation. Mr. Brown and other New England fishermen, however, whose states have much smaller shares, can legally land only a small fraction of the black sea bass they catch and must throw the rest overboard. And New England states like Maine, where fishermen are beginning to catch black sea bass regularly, have only a tiny allocation and no established fishery.\u201cOur management system assumes that the ocean has white lines drawn on it, but fish don\u2019t see those lines,\u201d said Malin L. Pinsky, an assistant professor in the department of ecology, evolution and natural resources at Rutgers University, who studies how marine species adapt to climate change. \u201cAnd our management system is not as nimble as the fish.\u201dThe mismatch between the location of fish and the rules for catching them has pitted recreational fishermen against commercial ones and state against state. It has heightened tensions among fishermen, government regulators and the scientists who advise them and raised questions for fishery managers that have no easy answers.Reflecting these tensions, Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, both Democrats of Connecticut, noted in a letter to the acting inspector general of the Commerce Department in June that fishermen in their state were experiencing \u201cextreme financial hardship\u201d because the apportionment of resources was so outdated.\u201cWe request that your office investigate how the current system impacts the region\u2019s fishermen and whether the structure should be reformed to bring quota allocations in line with current data on actual fish population distribution,\u201d the senators, joined by Representative Joe Courtney, also a Democrat of Connecticut, wrote. \u201cAs species of fish move north, the allocation levels should migrate with them.\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Although such shifts in allocations are possible, said Tom Nies, the executive director of the New England Fishery Management Council, in practice they are difficult to execute.\u201cIf you\u2019re giving fish to somebody, you\u2019re taking them away from somebody else,\u201d Mr. Nies said.But, he added, fishery managers at state and federal levels are examining ways to take into account the effects of warming ocean temperatures. Those approaches include changes in how permits are structured and giving states with nascent fisheries representation in councils that oversee states where the fish are well-established.\u201cI would be surprised if you find very many fishermen who will tell you that climate change is not happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear recognition from everybody that this is a problem, and a lot of people are working on how to address it.\u201dOne approach being actively pursued by scientists and managers is developing methods to incorporate temperature data and other characteristics of the environment into the surveys that regulators use to set fishing quotas.Richard J. Seagraves, the senior scientist for the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, said that in a series of surveys distributed and town hall-style meetings held by the council, \u201cthe most pressing concern expressed by all parties was the failure to address ecosystem considerations, like a changing climate and the physical effects on fish stocks.\u201dThe government periodically monitors fish species to see if they are thriving or at risk of extinction. The surveys are intended to determine how much fishing a given species can sustain, in order to avoid overfishing.But even in the best case, trying to estimate the size of fish populations is an uncertain proposition. And the migration of species in response to warming temperatures has made the task considerably harder.\u201cFrom a scientific perspective, there are some really interesting questions,\u201d Dr. Pinsky said. \u201cWhere did the fish go? Did we eat them? Or did they go somewhere else? Those are questions we haven\u2019t really had to grapple with.\u201dA 2014 survey of butterfish \u2014 a small, silvery fish that provides food for many larger fish species and is popular in Japan \u2014 illustrated the problem with traditional assessment methods.A previous survey of butterfish had been unsuccessful at figuring out how robust the population was \u2014 there was too much uncertainty in the assessment\u2019s sampling of the fish. Because regulators could not make a judgment about the status of the species, butterfish fishing was temporarily suspended.But when a team of scientists began talking to fishermen, they realized that the earlier survey had not taken into account the movements of the butterfish in response to changes in water temperature.\u201cWhat we learned from working with the fishermen was that the animals were probably occurring outside the survey,\u201d John A. Manderson, a research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s northeast fisheries science center.Dr. Manderson and his colleagues developed a way to factor movement patterns and temperature shifts into models for assessing the fish. Once their work was incorporated into the next survey, which found that butterfish were still plentiful, the fishery reopened.Dr. Manderson said that listening to fishermen, who are often in the best position to know how many fish there are and where they are, was the key to understanding what was occurring.\u201cWhat started out as an academic exercise turned into a collaborative one,\u201d Dr. Manderson said.Yet it remains difficult to tease apart how much of the dip in a fish population is a result of climate change and how much is a result of overfishing, or even of a natural fluctuation in population numbers from year to year.\u201cI think you\u2019ve got to be careful when you react to these things,\u201d Mr. Nies, of the New England fishery council, said. \u201cYou want to make sure you\u2019re reacting to a signal and not to noise.\u201dHe noted that there had been cases where regulators incorrectly concluded that a species had collapsed, citing the haddock population in the mid-1990s.\u201cHere we are 20 years later and we\u2019ve got more Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank haddock than has ever been detected in the last 100 years,\u201d he said.A growing number of scientists and managers favor moving eventually to what they call ecosystem-based management, a system that is focused on the environmental niche a species occupies, rather than individual species themselves.Under such a system, regulation would be aimed at making sure that there are enough fish available to maintain an ecological balance of predators and prey, and quotas might be based on a category of marine species, rather than specific fish. The West Coast has already adopted some version of this approach in the north Pacific, setting an overall quota for groundfish caught in the Bering Sea.Temperature affects fish species differently.\u201cClimate change is going to make it hard on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or warming waters,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who is the president of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen\u2019s Association, a trade group. \u201cBut as the impacts of climate change descend upon us, there are also species that are going to be victorious, hugely victorious.\u201dYet the changes are happening so fast that regulators will have to adapt quickly if they are to have any hope of keeping up. Marine species, Dr. Manderson said, are moving north at 10 times the rate of animals on land.\u201cOur ideas of property rights and laws are purely land-based,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ocean is all about flux and turbulence and movement.\u201dHe added, \u201cEven the science is too slow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump said on Wednesday that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was still in the running to become his secretary of state despite their bitter differences during the campaign, as he narrowed his choices and planned an announcement next week for the crucial post.Mr. Trump said the drawn-out selection process and highly publicized flirtation with Mr. Romney was not intended to torment a campaign nemesis but rather to find the right person to serve as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat.\u201cIt\u2019s not about revenge, it\u2019s about what\u2019s good for the country, and I\u2019m able to put this stuff behind us,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Nearly a month after his stunning election upset ended a bitterly divisive presidential race, Mr. Trump flatly refused any responsibility for the rifts, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not president yet, so I didn\u2019t do anything to divide.\u201dTold that his promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants who kill and rape Americans echo Mr. Duterte\u2019s talk about annihilating drug dealers and users, Mr. Trump did not dispute the comparison.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.\u201cWell, hey, look, this is bad stuff,\u201d he told Time. \u201cThey slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl\u2019s forehead, O.K.? What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said of the Russians.Mr. Trump also said he would have more \u201cbig announcements\u201d on personnel on Wednesday and Thursday.Another contender for secretary of state, he said on \u201cToday,\u201d is Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, whom he called a \u201cgreat, great gentleman\u201d who has \u201cbuilt a tremendous company over a period of years with great style.\u201d He said he had ruled out \u201cin my own mind\u201d other prominent candidates who have been considered for the post \u2014 a group that includes Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York; Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director; Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee; and John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations \u2014 but he declined to say which ones.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work it out, but you know that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to negotiate prices, and the planes are too expensive, and we\u2019re going to get the prices down, and if we don\u2019t get the prices down, we\u2019re not going to order them.\u201dHe also explained his apparent decision in June, divulged by a member of his transition team on Tuesday, to sell all of his stock holdings, a move he said he made to avoid \u201ctremendous\u201d potential conflicts of interest in the event he won the election.\u201cI don\u2019t think its appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I\u2019m making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In the interview with Time, he suggested he was willing to moderate some of his hard-line campaign stances and adjust others to appeal to a broader portion of Americans.Mr. Trump, whose campaign was fueled largely by promises to build a wall on the country\u2019s southern border and deport those who came in illegally, said he would like to find an accommodation for the undocumented young people \u2014 often referred to as Dreamers \u2014 who were brought to the United States as children. After Mr. Obama took executive action to create a program granting them legal status, many of those who came forward to register now worry that they could be easily found and deported.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d Mr. Trump told Time. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs.
