{"Headline": "Alibaba Faces Growing Pressure Over Counterfeit Goods", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Alibaba has a fakes problem.It also comes as Alibaba moves to satisfy increasingly sophisticated Chinese consumers who want higher-quality goods \u2014 a shift that has also drawn intensifying competition from Alibaba\u2019s rivals.Alibaba says it has increased efforts to find and eliminate counterfeit goods. In its report on Wednesday, the Office of the United States Trade Representative acknowledged those efforts \u2014 but said they were not enough.Taobao \u201cis an important concern due to the large volume of allegedly counterfeit and pirated goods available and the challenges right holders experience in removing and preventing illicit sales and offers of such goods,\u201d the agency said, citing complaints from brand owners about the proliferation of fakes on Taobao.\u201cWhile recent steps set positive expectations for the future,\u201d it added, \u201ccurrent levels of reported counterfeiting and piracy are unacceptably high.\u201dIn an email to the group that oversees how Alibaba\u2019s platforms are governed, Daniel Zhang, the company\u2019s chief executive, pushed the group to continue fighting counterfeiters, whom he described as being \u201clike bacteria in the air that we breathe.\u201d But he also compared the American move to trade protectionism and said Alibaba would face similar efforts elsewhere as it expanded.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if we encounter other situations similar to that of \u2018Notorious Markets\u2019 in the future, where protectionism leads to malicious acts to players in the market,\u201d he wrote in the email, which the company shared publicly.In recent years Alibaba has de-emphasized Taobao, a vast platform resembling eBay where sellers big and small can set up online stores. Analysts say its growth prospects are limited, and a growing number of Chinese consumers say they want to buy from sources they can better trust.\u201cThe problem is that anybody can open a Taobao shop and sell anything,\u201d said Shaun Rein, the founder and managing director of China Market Research Group.Yu Yang, an information technology engineer in Beijing, said he had started using Taobao more than a decade ago. \u201cBut I almost stopped completely about three or four years ago,\u201d he said, adding that it had become difficult to tell fake from real basketball sneakers, which he collects.Alibaba said its core Chinese retail business had 439 million annual active users during the year that ended in September, though it did not break out how many of them were Taobao users. That business makes its money by charging fees to, and providing advertising for, vendors.Alibaba has tried to steer business to its Tmall platform, which is geared toward larger sellers of higher-end name brands like Nike and Est\u00e9e Lauder. But that business faces intense competition from JD.com and others that manage their own inventory and act more as curators for finicky customers.Tmall is the dominant player in the business-to-consumer segment, as Tmall and its rivals are called, with a little more than half of the market, according to figures from the data firm iResearch. But the data also shows that it has slowly lost market share to others.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Culture, Not Its Companies, Dominates in China", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 The majesty of the Golden Gate, the windy chill of Alcatraz, the tourist hubbub of Pier 39 \u2014 Zhao Haoyu\u2019s itinerary for San Francisco had it all.Yet when Mr. Zhao, a Chinese tourist, arrived with his wife in September, they spent their first day wandering the humdrum suburban office parks that Facebook and Google call home.Joining a guided bus tour with a dozen other Chinese visitors, the two became part of the steady flow of Chinese tourists to Silicon Valley that represents \u2014 despite pervasive censorship and outright hostility from the Chinese government \u2014 the tremendous influence Silicon Valley wields in China.\u201cYou hear so much about these companies in China,\u201d said Mr. Zhao, a native of the southern Chinese city of Kunming who is in his 30s. \u201cWe just wanted to experience it.\u201dNeither prizes rebellion or disruption, so China\u2019s young entrepreneurs and investors have looked for guidance and inspiration in a place that does: Silicon Valley.China\u2019s tech world has copied the valley\u2019s innovator-meet-investor network of incubators, accelerators and venture capitalists. Start-up employees and leaders actively seek to question authority and think outside the box \u2014 two attributes widely discouraged in corporate China.\u201cI was having difficulty finding a partner who specializes on the technology side,\u201d said Mr. Yao, who estimated that he watched the movie more than 10 times in 2013 and 2014. \u201cI started to wonder how people in \u2018The Pirates of Silicon Valley\u2019 found their partners. So I watched the film over and over and learned a lot from it.\u201dAt times China seems to embrace Silicon Valley clich\u00e9s more eagerly than Silicon Valley itself.A prominent techie cafe in Beijing has a large wall with a timeline charting the initial public stock offerings of American tech companies alongside those in China. Some companies have created Apple-style product unveilings that are ticketed, cultural events. A developer in China is planning to start work on \u201ctech towns\u201d \u2014 planned communities where the innovative-minded can live and work together. Start-up offices often have open seating plans with office pets, foosball tables and a boss sitting with the employees.\u201cSilicon Valley has become a kind of beacon of cultural change in China,\u201d said David Chao, a partner at the venture capital firm DCM. \u201cHollywood could impact what kind of handbag a lady buys in China, but it never impacted corporate culture like Silicon Valley has.\u201dEven so, most Chinese companies have not fully absorbed the culture. Many are still highly top-down and bureaucratic, and open office plans often mask more deeply conservative customs. In place of California\u2019s sunny suburbs, China\u2019s innovation hub sits in the traffic and smog-choked northwestern part of Beijing, crammed into office towers above malls that sell all manner of electronics.The trend is nonetheless driving young people to take more risks and demand more from employers, even as it brings with it a problem familiar to Silicon Valley: hangers-on more interested in being a part of the scene than anything else.\u201cThere are people choosing technology not because they love it or want to do a start-up,\u201d said Jesse Lu, a Chinese entrepreneur who spent time at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up accelerator in the United States. \u201cThey just do it because they enjoy the lifestyle of a start-up. They enjoy choosing their hours, having small teams, not listening to anybody, doing what they think is right. It\u2019s a new fashion.\u201dSilicon Valley seems largely unaware of its cultural influence in China and appears to do little to cater to it.Last year, Facebook fired an enterprising Chinese employee who played to the unmet demand and charged one group of tourists $20 each to tour the campus and eat in the company\u2019s cafeteria. Now, the only thing notable for tourists to see is its thumbs-up sign.In Mountain View, Mr. Zhao and the tour group snapped photos of a cluster of brightly painted plaster statues designed after various Google corporate mascots. Next door is Google\u2019s visitor store, a sort of swag graveyard set up in converted office space where the company sells all manner of clothes and trinkets \u2014 including Frisbees and water bottles \u2014 imprinted with the Google logo.\u201cThey used to not let our buses on the campus, but now they built this area where we can come and take pictures,\u201d said Ken Guan, the leader of the tour group.\u201cPeople are surprised,\u201d he added. \u201cThey think it will be a booming commercial area, but it\u2019s just a bunch of offices.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Prosecutors Ask Court for More Time in Detained Tibetan\u2019s Case", "Date": "2016-12-28", "News": "Supported byThe prosecutors had sent the case against Tashi Wangchuk, 31, who is accused of inciting separatism, to the Yushu Intermediate Court in Qinghai Province in September. But this month, they asked the court to send the case back to them for further investigation, according to a judge and a defense lawyer.The move is \u201cvery rare,\u201d the lawyer, Lin Qilei, said in an interview. Prosecutors expect the additional investigation, which is likely to be carried out by the police, to be finished by Jan. 4, Mr. Lin said.It is unclear what the development may signal about whether the court will accept the case against Mr. Tashi, a businessman who has advocated Tibetan language education on a personal blog and in interviews with The Times. If the court accepts the case for trial, Mr. Tashi, who has said he is not a separatist, will almost certainly be convicted.The international advocacy on behalf of Mr. Tashi may have contributed to the fact that the court has yet to accept the case. The Chinese legal system operates with little transparency and under political imperatives, often from senior Communist Party officials, so it is difficult to discern how decisions are made.Prosecutors, known in China as the procuratorate, then asked the police twice to conduct further investigation. A judge with the Yushu Intermediate Court, who gave only his surname, Cui, said that the prosecutors had asked the court this month to send the case back to them for still more investigation and that the court had done so.In the 2015 interviews, Mr. Tashi said that he did not support Tibetan independence. He said he simply wanted to promote greater Tibetan language education and use of the language in public life, a right that is guaranteed by the Chinese Constitution, which provides a framework for autonomy in ethnic regions of China.Mr. Tashi also praised President Xi Jinping of China for having \u201cpromoted a democratic and law-abiding country these last few years.\u201dMr. Tashi traveled to Beijing early last year to try to file a lawsuit against Yushu officials, accusing them of suppressing Tibetan language education. He tried to persuade Chinese state news organizations to report on those efforts.He also came into contact with Times journalists in Beijing in May, and he met with them when they later traveled to Yushu. He repeatedly insisted that all his interviews be on the record and said he understood that they could potentially lead to his imprisonment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Meeting Trump, Japanese Mogul Pledges $50 Billion Investment in the U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byOn Tuesday, Mr. Son, a Japanese mogul, struck another big pledge after meeting with President-elect Donald J. Trump: to invest $50 billion in the United States, a move that he said would create some 50,000 jobs.But the $50 billion investment pledge is not an entirely new initiative that SoftBank is undertaking. Instead, the money is projected to come from the Japanese company\u2019s previously announced Vision fund, a $100 billion vehicle for investing in technology companies worldwide.The fund \u2014 which includes Saudi Arabia, a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire during the presidential campaign, as a key partner \u2014 was always expected to strike a significant portion of its deals in the United States.The advisory group was noticeably shy of technology names; Mr. Son is perhaps the most prominent tech executive so far to have met with the president-elect.Although it has its headquarters in Japan, SoftBank has deep roots in the United States. It is the majority owner of the wireless operator Sprint, which two years ago unsuccessfully pursued a takeover bid for T-Mobile. That effort was effectively blocked by the Obama administration on antitrust grounds.Mr. Son was not expected to discuss specific issues with Mr. Trump during their meeting, including the prospects of renewing a Sprint bid for its rival, according to a person briefed on the matter. Shares of Sprint and T-Mobile briefly rose Tuesday afternoon, before giving up their gains.Beyond what Mr. Trump and Mr. Son said, \u201cwe aren\u2019t able to say more,\u201d a SoftBank spokesman in Tokyo, Matthew Nicholson, said.\u201cI just came to celebrate his new job,\u201d Mr. Son, 59, told reporters at Trump Tower. \u201cI said: \u2018This is great. The U.S. will become great again.\u2019 \u201dSuch bold talk is customary from the American-educated Mr. Son, who has built one of Japan\u2019s biggest personal fortunes through sometimes brash deal-making. SoftBank, which began life as a software distributor, became one of Japan\u2019s biggest phone service companies through shrewd negotiations that gave the company early exclusive rights to the iPhone. It has since become a global empire with stakes in the likes of Sprint and Alibaba Group of China and in a welter of start-ups in the United States and abroad.In speaking with reporters alongside Mr. Trump on Tuesday, Mr. Son clutched what appeared to be a presentation from the meeting. One page featured the logos of both SoftBank and Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing giant that assembles Apple\u2019s iPhone. On the page \u2014 and circled \u2014 was the text committing to investing $50 billion in the United States and generating 50,000 jobs over the next four years.Below it appeared to be Mr. Son\u2019s signature.Foxconn said in a statement that it was in preliminary discussions about a potential American expansion, adding that the scale had not yet been decided. Foxconn has said in the past that it plans to expand its limited operations in the United States.Any Foxconn investment is not likely to mean a major flow of jobs back to America. The company has been plowing funds into automation and has said in the past that it would invest in a plant to build robots in Pennsylvania, indicating that new American jobs would probably be higher-end and limited in number.Foxconn employs about one million workers in China. But many of those jobs are low skilled, and as overall wages have risen in China, their pay levels have become less appealing to workers there. Maintaining enough staffing to meet production needs can be a challenge.Jonathan Soble and Paul Mozur contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill Gates Leads New Fund as Fears of U.S. Retreat on Climate Grow", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has bred fears that the United States will take a back seat in global efforts to tackle climate change.Could a billion-dollar investment fund led by Bill Gates and his fellow technology titans fill the void?Mr. Gates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, announced on Monday the start of a fund to invest in transformative energy research and development to reduce the emissions that cause climate change. The work would supplement and build on basic research already underway at government labs that may be threatened by the incoming administration.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s expressed skepticism about climate change and his appointment of fossil fuel advocates to his cabinet, Mr. Gates said he expected the president-elect to recognize that government funding of basic research would eventually be good for business, jobs, infrastructure and other economic elements that Mr. Trump campaigned on.\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal,\u201d Mr. Gates said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any inside knowledge of what the energy policies of this administration will look like,\u201d said Mr. Gates, who said he had a brief telephone call with Mr. Trump several weeks ago but declined to describe it further. \u201cIt\u2019s possible they will reduce energy research. But it\u2019s also significantly possible they would increase energy research.\u201dThe fund will consider investing in electricity generation and storage, transportation, agriculture and energy-system efficiency. Seed money for start-ups and projects ready for commercialization, among other efforts, will be considered, fund officials said.But those projects have yet to yield real-world results. Eight years after it was founded, TerraPower has not built a working prototype. Last year, it said that it was shifting some of its focus away from what had appeared to be a promising \u201ctraveling-wave reactor\u201d design that burns fuel made from depleted uranium. The start-up is now exploring a different nuclear concept based on molten chloride reactor technology, which uses a molten salt mixture, instead of water, as the primary reactor coolant.And while scientists see carbon-capture methods as a potential game changer in efforts to stabilize the global climate, they fear the technology would remain prohibitively expensive.The elusiveness of concrete breakthroughs \u2014 and the long time frames and significant capital required for energy start-ups to develop materials, hardware and technology \u2014 have underscored the difficulty venture capitalists have faced so far in funding breakthroughs, as well as in generating returns for investors.Mr. Gates said that his new fund would tap into scientific expertise \u201cway more than any venture fund would have.\u201d He said the fund would announce a management team within three months.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very deep scientific team both at the companies itself and as our advisers,\u201d he said.A powerful ally, he said, is the University of California system, which is a partner in the fund.Janet Napolitano, president of the system, said the schools had \u201chundreds of scientists working on the issue of how do you create an affordable, reliable energy supply that doesn\u2019t contribute to the greenhouse gas problem.\u201dAnother major difference, Mr. Gates said, was that the fund\u2019s investors were in it for the long haul. They saw the value of waiting decades for a big reward.\u201cAnd once you can make cheap electricity reliably,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a huge market for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "$25 Million in Breakthrough Prizes Given in Science and Math", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byThis year\u2019s winners include five molecular biologists who won $3 million each for work in genetics and cell biology, one mathematician, a trio of string theorists who split one $3 million physics prize, and another 1,015 physicists working on the LIGO gravitational wave detector split a special $3 million physics prize. In addition, there were six smaller \u201cNew Horizons\u201d prizes totaling $600,000 for 10 \u201cearly career\u201d researchers, and a pair of high school students won $400,000 apiece for making science videos.The Breakthrough Foundation was founded by Sergey Brin of Google; Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe; Jack Ma of Alibaba and his wife, Cathy Zhang; Yuri Milner, an internet entrepreneur, and his wife, Julia Milner; and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan.It sprang from Mr. Milner\u2019s decision in 2012 to hand out $3 million apiece to nine theoretical physicists, in the belief that physicists are equal to rock stars and deserve to be paid and celebrated like them. Over the years, as more sponsors have joined, the prizes have spread to life sciences and mathematics. The winners each year are chosen by a committee of previous winners.For the last few years, the awards have been given out in an Oscar-style ceremony held at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, with a variety of Hollywood celebrities, who this year include Morgan Freeman, Alicia Keys and Jeremy Irons.There were two physics prizes awarded this year.According to string theory, all the forces and particles of nature are composed of tiny little wriggling strings. In 1995, Dr. Polchinski showed that the theory also contains objects of two dimensions or more, called \u201cbranes,\u201d short for membranes. This led to a whole new branch of cosmology, in which branes could be island universes floating in an extra-dimensional space like leaves in a fish tank, colliding and otherwise interacting with each other through a higher dimension.In a celebrated calculation in 1996, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Vafa used string theory to compute the information content, or entropy, of a black hole. Their result verified a prediction made by Stephen Hawking using more approximate methods that black holes would leak radiation and eventually explode.Some recent work includes a \u201cdecoupling theorem\u201d \u2014 a sort of very abstract generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applied to oscillating waves like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proven by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter of Indiana University shows similar relationships in the superposition of waves.Dr. Elledge has described DNA as being constantly under attack but having the ability \u2014 he calls it a sort of chemical intelligence \u2014 to monitor its own integrity and activate various defense mechanisms.His research interests range far and wide. In 2015, he and his team reported that they had developed a test that, using less than a drop of blood, could reveal nearly every virus a person had ever been exposed to. Other scientists saw vast potential in the test, suggesting it could be used to track patterns of disease across populations and to learn more about how viruses, and the body\u2019s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer.Dr. Noller is a biochemist and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to obtain the first image of the ribosome\u2019s molecular structure. His work also helped show that ribosomes are ribozymes, a type of RNA molecule that can facilitate chemical reactions. In this case, the ribozymes stitch amino acids together to build proteins.The Wnt signaling pathway is found in every branch of the animal kingdom. It is involved in things as diverse as setting off breast cancer in mice and helping orchestrate the body plan of fruit flies. It has become an important part in many aspects of biology because the molecular cascade it sets off affects the growth of the entire ecosystem of the body.But insight into its inner workings may provide a way to combat its progression. Dr. Zoghbi\u2019s findings have helped provide the groundwork to fighting the disease.Dr. Zoghbi also helped uncover the culprit behind another neurodegenerative disease, Rett syndrome. This crippling condition mostly affects young girls and is often fatal. There are fewer than 1,000 cases a year in the United States. Her team searched for the cause behind the malady for 16 years, eventually identifying it as a mutation in the gene MECP2. By identifying the gene, she also found that it plays a part in other neurological disorders, providing a starting point to fighting the diseases.Organelles, proteins and other molecules inside the cell are constantly becoming damaged or worn out, especially as the cell divides. If too much rubbish builds up, it can become toxic and kill the cell. Autophagy is also a tool that the cell uses to refuel itself if it is starving.During autophagy, the cell produces internal garbage bags called autophagosomes that capture waste. The autophagosomes are sealed by a double membrane that keeps in the junk. They then fuse with organelles called lysosomes, which carry enzymes that help dissolve whatever is inside.Researchers think that failures in autophagy could contribute to Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also think it could help us better understand the process of aging.In addition to the big $3 million prizes, there were six $100,000 New Horizons prizes \u2013 half in physics and half in mathematics. The young physics winners are: Asimina Arvanitaki of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, Peter Graham of Stanford and Surjeet Rajendran of the University of California, Berkeley, who split one prize; Simone Giombi of Princeton and Xi Yin of Harvard who split another prize; and Frans Pretorius of Princeton.In mathematics, the New Horizons winners were Mohammed Abouzaid of Columbia University; Hugo Duminil-Copin of the University of Geneva; and Benjamin Elias of the University of Oregon and Geordie Williamson of Kyoto University.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s victory in the United States presidential election.The primary beneficiary of Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat is Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement, a party that advocates a referendum on whether Italy should give up the euro.Those fearing the advance of populist forces could claim some respite, though.For Mr. Trump\u2019s children, family and business have always been intertwined.The Trump Organization said that it was preparing an \u201cimmediate transfer of management\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s three eldest children \u2014 Donald Jr., 38; Ivanka, 35; and Eric, 32 \u2014 along with a team of executives.But the professional histories of the three children, who also serve on the presidential transition team, show how deeply the Trump family, Trump business and Trump politics are interwoven.Take, for example, the Trump International Hotel in Washington.\u2022 The children each hold a stake in the lease that allows the organization to operate the hotel from the federal government\u2019s Old Post Office Building in Washington.\u2022 Mr. Trump, as president, will appoint the head of the General Services Administration, the government agency that manages the property, while his children oversee the hotel.\u201cGiving to the Trump family would be seen by many foreign leaders as the way to get in with the Trump administration,\u201d said Meredith McGehee, an adviser to the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group.

The current chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is only the latest.But if you dig into Yahoo\u2019s numbers, the business, once in rapid decline, is stabilizing. There has yet to be any significant sign that this hacking or the previously announced one have materially affected Yahoo\u2019s earnings or revenue.Given this, it seems that talk of Verizon being able to walk away from the Yahoo deal is overblown.Yahoo earned $229 million in the third quarter, before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, with revenue of $858 million (both adjusted to take into account acquisition costs and other one-time earnings.)These numbers were hailed as pretty good, within the midrange of Yahoo\u2019s estimates for 2016. Yahoo\u2019s free cash flow was also $167 million, up from $18 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ms. Mayer has tried to refocus Yahoo\u2019s business on the so-called Mavens (mobile, video, native and social). Here, the company appears to be stable. Mavens revenue has gone from almost nothing in 2012 to $385 million in the 2016 third quarter. That was down 4 percent from 2015, but largely because of declines in video with the three other segments growing modestly.Given Yahoo\u2019s more than one billion monthly active users and that there is so much uncertainty surrounding its business, it is hard not to view Verizon\u2019s deal as a bargain at $4.8 billion. Snap has only 150 million active users and is being hyped as going public with a $25 billion valuation at 25 times forecast revenue (Yahoo\u2019s buyout price is only about six times current revenue).In the case of the Yahoo hackings, it doesn\u2019t appear that this threshold has been met.It is hard to see Yahoo incurring higher costs. These breaches happened more than three years ago. It is difficult to know or even trace any bad effect given the passage of time. Even if you could trace the effect, the hacked information in many cases is stale or unimportant. Yahoo said it included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, passwords and possibly encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. In the last three years, much of this information has changed, though admittedly birth dates have not.Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that Verizon isn\u2019t pursuing the possibility of using the material adverse effect clause to alter the deal terms. This is M&A Strategy 101. Verizon will most likely request as much information as possible from Yahoo to slow things down and make Yahoo nervous. According to the playbook, it will eventually claim that Yahoo is not complying with these information requests. That\u2019s probably what is going on now behind the scenes.If Verizon is pursuing this strategy, it is doing so to cajole Yahoo\u2019s board into cutting $1 billion to $2 billion off the deal price just to be done with the matter. Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization of $36.9 billion, because of its ownership of a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, makes $1 billion a rounding error.The parties have incentives, therefore, to simply recut the deal and lower the price or have Yahoo explicitly assume the direct liabilities related to the hacking. In Yahoo\u2019s case the biggest incentive is simply to end its long nightmare and move on.But I\u2019m hoping that Yahoo stays firm. Of all the internet 1.0 businesses \u2014 Lycos, Kozmo.com, broadcast.com, pets.com \u2014 Yahoo and Amazon are the only ones still standing. It is a credit to both companies, but also evidence that for all her faults, Ms. Mayer has stabilized a troubled business. And if the Yahooers actually believe this, Verizon will not have much to stand on.If Yahoo stands firm right now and no new bad facts come out, Verizon will have to close or be forced by a court to do so. That Yahoo hasn\u2019t already sued to force a closing shows how gun-shy the company has become.For the rest of us, we will have to wait. In the meantime, we should change our passwords.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

It also makes smartphones, designed to improve selfie-taking, which are endorsed by the Chinese actress Angelababy.The share listing will offer a rare gauge of whether global investors agree with the sky-high valuations often found in China\u2019s tech start-up scene. Venture capitalists and private investors have leapt into the field, which has given rise to successful app- and gadget-makers amid an e-commerce and financial technology boom.But many of China\u2019s hottest start-ups have been snapped up by its three major internet companies \u2014 the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, the social media and gaming conglomerate Tencent Holdings and the search provider Baidu \u2014 before they go public. That leaves it unclear whether the high valuations of many Chinese start-ups can be sustained.The Hong Kong Exchange has not seen a technology offering of this size in nearly a decade. The biggest previous I.P.O. of this type was Alibaba\u2019s listing of its business-to-business e-commerce unit in 2007, in which it raised $1.7 billion, according to data from Dealogic.Meitu said in a news release that it planned to use the proceeds from the offering to expand its smartphone business, buy or invest in other businesses and bolster its marketing.\u201cThrough growing our user base and enhancing users\u2019 engagement in a cost-efficient manner, we are determined to develop Meitu as a portfolio of innovative photo and community apps so as to retain and attract more business partners to our ecosystem \u2014 which could ultimately contribute to our revenue,\u201d Cai Wensheng, the founder of the company, said in a news release.The company has a variety of beauty-focused apps with about 456 million users, but most of its revenue comes from selling smartphones in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.Shares are expected to start trading on Dec. 15.The offering is sponsored by Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and China Merchants Securities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son Chases First Place With Tech Deals", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Masayoshi Son is a Japanese billionaire who wants to control the way your car talks to street lamps.The 59-year-old technology investor \u2014 a grandson of South Korean immigrants who has amassed one of Japan\u2019s largest personal fortunes by pursuing grand, Silicon Valley-inspired visions \u2014 is best known outside his homeland for buying the American mobile phone carrier Sprint for $21.6 billion in 2013.His goal is nothing less than to change how the material world works \u2014 and to turn his company, the SoftBank Group, into the future\u2019s most important technology business. Specifically, he is planning for a day when millions of everyday objects run on chips and tiny computers that talk to one another \u2014 allowing street lamps, for example, to save power by switching themselves off when cars are not around.The bets are risky. SoftBank is buying ARM for a rich $32 billion, and it plans to plow another $25 billion in the Saudi joint venture over the next five years. Neither guarantees that SoftBank will stay globally relevant in a fast-changing digital world.Mr. Son\u2019s track record includes big victories, like an early investment in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. But his deal for Sprint has so far resulted mostly in red ink. And his ambitions led to the departure of his handpicked successor, leaving questions over who will oversee SoftBank\u2019s future.\u201cSon acts on instinct,\u201d said Satoshi Shima, a former senior lieutenant to Mr. Son who is now a professor at Tama University. \u201cIt\u2019s a genius instinct, but it\u2019s not logic.\u201dThe ARM purchase is crucial to Mr. Son\u2019s ambitions. The British company aims to wire up self-driving cars, internet-enabled home appliances, medical devices and even clothing.\u201cSoftBank has had a lot of businesses, but they\u2019ve always ranked, say, third in Japan, or fourth in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Son said in July after announcing the ARM deal. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re directly controlling a business that is No. 1 in the world.\u201dWith a $14.9 billion personal fortune, Mr. Son is ranked by Forbes as Japan\u2019s second-richest man, behind Tadashi Yanai, the owner of Fast Retailing and its Uniqlo brand. But he spent his early life in poverty: His father started out as a bootlegger and small-time pig farmer before finding success in restaurants and pachinko, the Japanese offshoot of pinball. By the time he was a teenager, his family was wealthy enough that he was able to travel to the United States for college, eventually ending up at the University of California, Berkeley.Mr. Son founded SoftBank in 1981 as a distributor of computer software. For start-up money, he has told biographers, he sold a prototype electronic translation machine to Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, for about $1 million. Mr. Son, who trained in economics, not engineering, came up with the general idea for the machine while still in college, then recruited others to create it \u2014 an approach he has followed throughout his career.Takenobu Miki worked closely with Mr. Son for eight years before leaving SoftBank in 2006 to found an online language-training start-up. Initially, he was the only full-time employee at SoftBank, which, despite sounding like a tech start-up, operated \u201clike an investment fund, with a portfolio of holdings that Son would adjust based on changing growth rates,\u201d Mr. Miki said.One item in the portfolio was Yahoo, an early investment that earned Mr. Son a fortune. The investment displayed Mr. Son\u2019s willingness to act on a general conviction: in this case, that web portals would be crucial to the early commercial development of the internet. He did relatively little research on Yahoo itself, Mr. Miki recalled. \u201cHe asked some contacts in Silicon Valley which was the best web portal, and they said Yahoo. So he bought.\u201dMr. Miki also remembers working with Mr. Son to create a growth projection for SoftBank that extended 300 years into the future.\u201cThe goal was to become a 100 trillion-yen company,\u201d Mr. Miki said, an amount equal to about $1 trillion. \u201cEven at that time, Son wanted to become No. 1 in the world.\u201dSoftBank declined to make Mr. Son available for an interview for this article.Mr. Son revels in confrontation, a trait that sets him apart in harmony-obsessed Japan. Twice, he has threatened to set fire to himself or the offices of Japanese telecommunications regulators \u2014 the first time in a dispute over access to fiber-optic cable, the second in a fight over internet censorship. He apologized in the second instance, in 2010, calling the threat an inappropriate joke.In 2013, he apologized again at a news conference after he became involved in a shouting match with government officials over plans to allocate cellular spectrum to KDDI, a SoftBank rival. \u201cI thought I had grown up,\u201d he said.Mr. Son has made bold, expensive acquisitions before. In 2006, he borrowed heavily to buy the Japanese arm of Vodafone, the British cellphone carrier, which was badly lagging two Japanese rivals. He tore up the company\u2019s pricing strategy, using discounts to undercut the industry\u2019s cozy near duopoly, then negotiated exclusive rights to carry Apple\u2019s iPhone. Subscriber numbers and profits soared.Hoping to repeat his success in the United States, SoftBank spent $21.6 billion to acquire Sprint in 2013. But there were no exclusive iPhone deals to be had, and American officials blocked a plan by Mr. Son to buy another carrier, T-Mobile, which would have given the business more scale. Sprint has hemorrhaged money \u2014 it lost $302 million last quarter \u2014 though lately its subscriber base has been expanding.SoftBank\u2019s deal with Saudi Arabia will give Mr. Son even more money to play with, though it could also make future investments more complicated because the involvement of the Saudi government could lead to extra scrutiny when striking deals in other countries.After the Sprint deal, it seemed Mr. Son was looking ahead to retirement. That would have fit with a life plan he drew up while still in his 20s, in which he resolved to build a business empire and hand it over to a successor in his 60s. In 2014, he hired a star Google executive, Nikesh Arora, and all but anointed him to that role.But with the ARM acquisition, the chance for another big, transformative deal appears to have proved too tempting. Mr. Arora announced his resignation in June, a month before the acquisition. Mr. Son said he wanted to stay on for another decade or so to \u201cwork on a few more crazy ideas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shadow of Amazon, European Challenger Looks to China for Inspiration", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it.\u201cWe wanted to take that experience back to Europe,\u201d Mr. Gentz said.This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe\u2019s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world\u2019s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent\u2019s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess.The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando.These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley heavy-hitters a run for their money across the region, still one of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 markets.\u201cIf you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional e-commerce player,\u201d said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary move.\u201dZalando\u2019s inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges.Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox Net-a-Porter, may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on e-commerce.For most Americans \u2014 and even some Europeans outside its core German-speaking markets \u2014 Zalando is not a household name.To meet the needs of Europe\u2019s national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders.\u201cZalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,\u201d said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London.Still, the company remains a relative minnow \u2014 its $9.5 billion valuation is one-fortieth that of Amazon. And Europe\u2019s fast-growing online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by e-commerce giants.To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape.On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on push-scooters sped through Zalando\u2019s first custom-built logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more \u2014 from Italy to Germany \u2014 are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London.As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando\u2019s I.P.O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion.For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando\u2019s website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility.\u201cNo one else offers this level of partnership,\u201d said Roland Auschel, Adidas\u2019s head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.The e-commerce company has also offered up its in-house advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with \u201conline influencers,\u201d or personalities with large social media followings.For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger.\u201cIn the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,\u201d Mr. Borg said.\u201cThat is our biggest challenge,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do we change the online experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Ride-Hailing Rules Focus on Where Drivers Call Home", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Fresh from school with a degree in hotel management, Luo Haichao left his hometown and moved to Beijing to look for a bigger paycheck. He eventually found one in a different sector: driving cars. China has created its own local versions of Uber and Lyft, and the ride-hailing business is booming.But now Mr. Luo \u2014 and potentially tens of thousands of other drivers \u2014 will have to get off the road.Citing safety and other issues, the cities of Beijing and Shanghai said on Wednesday that Chinese ride-hailing companies must stop using out-of-town drivers like Mr. Luo and hire only local residents to sit behind the wheel.In a statement, Didi said the rules represented a \u201csignificant step toward a more sensible and liberal framework,\u201d and were less limiting on pricing, cars and driver restrictions than earlier drafts. A spokeswoman declined to comment on how the Beijing and Shanghai residency requirements for drivers would affect its business.But the new ride-share regulations show that the technology industry in China is coming up against long-held concerns in the country about overcrowding, a widening wealth gap and access to education, health care and other services.\u201cAt the bottom of the conflict is tension between powerful vested interests and a new rising class,\u201d said Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. The political power of China\u2019s taxi services \u2014 which see ride-hailing companies as dangerous rivals \u2014 presents a particularly strong challenge, he said.It is not clear how many drivers would be affected, but the numbers could be significant. In Shanghai, for instance, fewer than 10,000 of the 410,000 active drivers registered to Didi Chuxing have permanent residency papers, according to Didi. Also on Wednesday, the southern boomtown of Guangzhou joined cities that had previously instituted less-restrictive residency requirements. In its statement, Didi said the city of Beijing had given it five months to implement the rules.Officials in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment. But they were quoted by local news outlets citing safety concerns and a need to track drivers, as in the case a year ago, when a 28-year-old Beijing ride-share driver made headlines when he punched a drunk passenger, breaking an eye socket. The officials were also mentioned as citing local regulations already in place that require taxi drivers to be residents of the city where they work.At issue is China\u2019s unique household registration \u2014 or hukou \u2014 system, which was intended to keep rural workers from flooding into more populous regions. The larger cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, need a steady influx of people like Mr. Luo to function.The ride-hailing business poses especially tricky concerns for local governments. Taxi drivers, who are required to be local residents, feel threatened and have flexed their political muscle. In some cities, taxi drivers have gone on strike, sometimes harassing ride-share drivers.That has discouraged some ride-share drivers. \u201cThere are fewer and fewer rewards,\u201d said Wen Zhenjiang, 37, who worked for Didi and Uber in Beijing for nearly two years and is now looking for work driving trucks.There are other reasons to leave. Driving full-time often means 14- to 15-hour shifts each day, sometimes overnight if there is strong demand. Most drivers rent vehicles, but some \u2014 like Mr. Luo \u2014 bought their own after they started to make good money. To save on rent, many share apartments in the suburbs.Their employers don\u2019t keep tabs on how often the drivers work or require them to reach driving quotas. However, if they get bad ratings from passengers, they risk losing bonus payments.Still, the rewards of getting into the ride-hailing business are clear: Mr. Luo has occasionally earned about $4,350 in a month, or three times more than the average Beijing office worker.On Wednesday, online groups devoted to ride-share drivers were filled with messages of anger and disappointment. Many said they would return to driving illegal taxis. \u201dThat will probably make me more money,\u201d wrote a driver named Xiaowei. Another, named Canyue, said, \u201cWhatever the rule is, I will keep driving as long as I can still tap \u2018start a service\u2019 on my app.\u201dMr. Luo has a lot at stake. He is married and has an apartment and a mortgage back home in Chengde County in Hebei Province. His living is a good one for someone with a rural hukou. He is still making monthly payments equal to about $290 on his car and paying the same amount on his mortgage.\u201cThis is unfair to people from outside Beijing,\u201d he said.But his days in the business are probably numbered, he said on Wednesday. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t allowed, I will stop driving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I do? I can\u2019t put all my eggs in one basket.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs to Extend Its Reach in Trump Administration", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs\u2019s outsize influence in Washington is about to get larger.The position that Mr. Cohn is expected to take up is one that has long been identified with Goldman and its influence in the capital.The role was established by President Bill Clinton and given to Goldman\u2019s co-chairman at the time, Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Rubin\u2019s co-chairman, Stephen Friedman, later held the position under President George W. Bush.This time, however, the selection of a Goldman insider is at odds with statements made by Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. He repeatedly attacked the financial elite \u2014 and Goldman Sachs in particular.In a commercial that ran in the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Trump warned about \u201ca global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\u201d The face of Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein \u2014 Mr. Cohn\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator \u2014 was among the images that flashed ominously on the screen.And Mr. Trump criticized both Hillary Clinton and a primary opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, over their ties to the investment bank. \u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one primary debate. \u201cThey have total, total control\u201d over Mr. Cruz, he said. \u201cJust like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\u201dSince his election, however, Mr. Trump has stocked his future cabinet with a number of Goldman alumni, including Mr. Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and a former Goldman trader, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.Unlike those two, Mr. Cohn is a longtime top Goldman executive who was helping to guide the firm before and during the financial crisis.In Mr. Cohn, Mr. Trump is not only turning to yet another Goldman hand \u2014 and a registered Democrat \u2014 but he is also choosing a financier whose thinking about the economy has stood in contrast to the president-elect\u2019s more nationalistic views.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve it with domestic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump has criticized companies that have moved their work force overseas, Mr. Cohn has been candid about Goldman\u2019s international outlook: \u201cWe have a globalized work force, so when I need to go out and hire the incremental worker, I go out and look around the world and see where that incremental worker is available.\u201dMr. Cohn, though, has agreed with Mr. Trump about the need to lighten the regulations that have been imposed on banks like Goldman since the financial crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re all giving President-elect Trump and his transition team the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting to see what happens.\u201dMr. Cohn, 56, rose through the ranks of Goldman as a trader and is known for his gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, which could help explain his rapport with the plain-spoken Mr. Trump.In recent years, Mr. Cohn has been in line to take over the firm from Mr. Blankfein, and his departure will open the door to a new crop of candidates looking to lead the firm.While he has been registered as a Democrat, Mr. Cohn has donated to both political parties. He has given tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Yet more important, he has become friends with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser.The decision follows an extended courtship in which the Goldman executive visited with Mr. Trump three times, most recently on Thursday.Leaving Wall Street to take a top government post could provide a huge financial gain for Mr. Cohn.He would probably have to sell his Goldman holdings to avoid conflicts of interest with his new role, which would normally generate a big tax bill immediately. But tax regulations allow executive branch appointees to roll the proceeds of such a sale into Treasury securities and defer capital gains taxes.Mr. Cohn owned 872,712 shares in Goldman as of Nov. 14, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. As of Friday afternoon\u2019s stock price, that stake was worth about $209 million.Goldman Sachs has already been a beneficiary of the coming Trump administration. Mr. Trump has promised to push back on financial regulations passed since the financial crisis, which have come down particularly hard on Goldman. Since the election, shares of banks and other financial institutions have risen sharply; Goldman\u2019s is up 34 percent.On Friday, Goldman\u2019s shares edged up slightly.Mr. Cohn grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, the son of a real estate developer and electrical contractor. He later attended Gilmour Academy, a private school in the area, and then American University, though he has often spoken of his struggles with dyslexia.In 1994, Mr. Cohn joined the vaunted partnership at Goldman, in a class that included a number of financial luminaries: Eric M. Mindich, now a hedge fund mogul; J. Michael Evans, formerly a top Goldman executive in China who is now at the Alibaba Group; and Mr. Mnuchin himself.By 2006, Mr. Cohn had become co-president and co-chief operating officer of the firm when Mr. Blankfein took the helm as chief executive. He took sole ownership of the No. 2 spot in 2009 and solidified his role as the heir apparent.Over his career, the 6-foot-3 Mr. Cohn has been known for a brusque and intimidating presence, reportedly looming over traders at their desks. But he has softened that approach over the years as he became more of a financial diplomat, flying to Washington, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and other centers of power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Taiwan, a Dilemma Over Identity, Economy and China", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported bySinosphereYour book deals with the seeming contradiction of China and Taiwan developing closer economic ties, even as Taiwanese culture moves further away from China\u2019s. How have those trends managed to emerge simultaneously?Once China began to open its economy in the post-Mao era, cultural similarities and a common political objective of creating \u201cone China\u201d led to an explosion of economic relations across the strait. The Chinese economy was highly complementary to Taiwan\u2019s, and a majority of Taiwanese considered themselves \u201cChinese.\u201d Today, more than two-thirds of Taiwan\u2019s outward foreign direct investment is to China, which is also Taiwan\u2019s leading trading partner.However, as cross-strait economic interdependence grew and as Taiwan began to democratize, the residents of the island began to debate what it meant to be Taiwanese, a topic that had been taboo for four decades under the authoritarian Kuomintang government. At first, Taiwan\u2019s economic policy toward China oscillated between extreme restriction and extreme liberalization. Some Taiwanese believed supporting economic liberalization with China was a way of promoting unification, while supporting economic restriction with China was equivalent to preserving a separate Taiwan, whether that be simply autonomy or outright independence.Do you see any way that Taiwanese identity could move closer to China\u2019s in the coming decades?Nonetheless, it is entirely possible for this identity to swing back to become more Chinese. This will depend on the strategy Beijing employs, especially whether it can create a common identity that includes Taiwanese. But if Beijing stays the course by imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions while providing economic benefits to a select few, it will create more backlash and resentment \u2014 just as it has in Hong Kong. Alternatively, Beijing could choose to close the gap across the strait by fostering democratic values and allowing the emergence of civil society, but this seems highly unlikely at present.What are the economic implications of the Trump administration for Taiwan? Your book focuses on the China-Taiwan relationship, but what do you make of the recent Trump-Tsai telephone call and the impact that could have on the cross-strait relationship?The call President-elect Donald Trump accepted from President Tsai alarmed many experts. Some fear the call will destabilize U.S.-China relations, while others saw it as a welcome sign of upgraded U.S.-Taiwan relations. I do not believe there is evidence of a major policy change yet. But if Trump views Taiwan simply as a way to put pressure on Beijing, then that would mean Taiwan is regarded merely as a means to an end, rather than important to the U.S. in its own right. Is there a space for Ms. Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party-led government to find a balance on cross-straits issues that Beijing can find acceptable? Or do you expect Beijing to be obstinate in its attempts to freeze out the D.P.P.?Tsai has already made compromises that go too far for many of her supporters. In her inaugural speech, Tsai referred to the Constitution of the Republic of China and the legislation governing cross-strait relations, both of which imply the acceptance of a \u201cone China\u201d framework. Tsai may not have room to move much further, especially if Beijing continues to freeze out the D.P.P.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japanese Mogul Starts on Vow to Trump to Create 50,000 U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byOn Monday, Mr. Son\u2019s conglomerate, SoftBank, took what it described as the first step in fulfilling that commitment.\u201cEarlier this month, I met with President-elect Trump and shared my commitment to investing and creating jobs in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Son said in a statement. \u201cAmerica has always been at the forefront of innovation and technological development, and we are thrilled to be playing a part in continuing to drive that growth as we work to create a truly globally connected ecosystem.\u201dMr. Son, whose technology and telecommunications empire has made him one of Japan\u2019s wealthiest men, has positioned himself as a prospective partner of the coming Trump administration by promising to help spur job growth.At a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan this month, Mr. Son pledged to invest $50 billion in the United States, which, by his reckoning, would create about 50,000 jobs. Mr. Trump has cited the pledge as a sign that he could persuade the private sector to lead improvements in the national economy.The OneWeb investment does not come from the Vision fund, a spokesman for SoftBank said. Instead it will come directly from SoftBank, as yet another investment in technology it views as potentially disruptive. (SoftBank is providing $1 billion of the investment, while the rest is coming from OneWeb investors.)During its history, SoftBank has struck deals for stakes in companies including the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, the online lender SoFi and the Chinese ride-hailing start-up Didi Chuxing.The new deal will give SoftBank and its partners nearly half of OneWeb, a four-year-old start-up based in Arlington, Va., that aims to beam internet access to unconnected areas of the world through satellites it intends to launch. Greg Wyler, who founded OneWeb, said in an interview that it wanted to bring the internet to every unconnected school in the world by 2022, then provide reasonably priced internet throughout the world five years later by making about 720 satellites and putting them into orbit.SoftBank is joining a list of OneWeb partners that includes Airbus, Qualcomm, Richard Branson of the Virgin Group and the satellite company Intelsat.Mr. Wyler said in the interview that the job creation number came from estimates of jobs that had been or would be created in its ranks and at partners like Qualcomm. Many of the jobs, he said, would be at OneWeb\u2019s satellite manufacturing plant in Exploration Park, Fla., which is a joint venture with Airbus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Though Awash in Fakes, China Rethinks Counterfeit Hunters", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Ji Wanchang strolled through a Beijing luxury mall one recent morning with an eye out for luxury coats. But at one store, a clerk told him a fur-collared Moncler and other coats were \u201csample sizes\u201d and not for sale.A second clerk, selling a wolf fur-lined Yves Salomon, said the coat was reserved.Mr. Ji sighed. In both cases, the fur wouldn\u2019t match their labels, he suspected \u2014 and the clerks knew selling a fake to Mr. Ji, who is well known on sight in many of China\u2019s shops, meant big trouble.\u201cMa\u2019am, I don\u2019t want to make things difficult for you,\u201d he told a sales clerk, who nodded and bowed. \u201cI\u2019ve found problems with your clothes, so please correct them.\u201dMr. Ji is what is known in China as a professional counterfeit hunter. Part Ralph Nader, part bounty hunter, Mr. Ji rummages for fake or substandard goods in shops. Then, using China\u2019s consumer protection laws, he collects tens of thousands of dollars from the companies that make or sell them. The laws are part of China\u2019s growing effort to weed out the fake clothes, electronics, food and furniture that swamp its stores and frustrate companies and consumers alike.But Mr. Ji\u2019s livelihood is now under threat. Some government officials say Mr. Ji and the unknown number of others like him abuse a law that was meant merely to empower consumers to report fakes. If proposed new government rules get accepted, people like Mr. Ji will no longer be able to go pro.One anti-fake effort was intended to empower the consumer. In 2009, the government promised consumers that if they found a product that flouted food safety laws, they could win 10 times the value of that product in compensation. In 2013, China bolstered an earlier consumer protection law by increasing payouts to buyers of other kinds of fake goods, while a decision from China\u2019s supreme court was widely seen as supporting counterfeit hunters.Mr. Ji and his peers have used these laws to their advantage, buying knockoffs in bulk \u2014 the more they turn in, the more they are paid \u2014 and filling their storerooms withcounterfeit products. Mr. Ji\u2019s group, the Jinan Old Ji Anti-Counterfeit Rights Defense Work Studio, has a network of about 20 informers who report suspected fake products. He says his biggest success to date is collecting about $178,000 in compensation from a company that tried to pass off its blankets as pure cashmere.China\u2019s e-commerce boom has given counterfeit hunters a new front.\u201cThe main purpose of suing them is to ask them to correct themselves,\u201d said Yu Fengxing, another counterfeit hunter, who chases merchants who sell fakes on online marketplaces run by the Alibaba Group, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company. He became an e-commerce counterfeit hunter after he bought an item marketed by a merchant on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform as a foot treatment and discovered that it was probably just makeup. In a statement, Alibaba said it was committed to fighting fakes on its platforms.Among overseas companies, people like Mr. Ji have fans. \u201cA lot of my clients would, in some circumstances, support the activities of these kinds of consumer warriors because ultimately they may be uncovering information that helps us do our job,\u201d said Scott Palmer, an intellectual property lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, which represents American corporations in China.But government officials complain that the program is increasingly expensive and increasingly abused. Even some foreign business groups complain. Counterfeit hunters often profit \u201cfrom complaints that target minor product labeling errors instead of true quality or safety issues,\u201d said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, in emailed comments.Proposed government rules released in August and under official consideration said that payouts for fakes would not be available to those who sought them \u201cfor commercial purposes.\u201dMr. Ji, defending his work, says he has to recoup his legal fees, which he incurs when the companies he accuses of selling fakes fight back. He says he makes about $148,000 a year but his take-home pay is only about $30,000 to $44,000 after expenses.\u201cWhen they encounter a fake product, more than 80 percent of Chinese people will just suck it up and not take it very seriously, as long as their lives are not in danger,\u201d Mr. Ji said. \u201cIf there are more professional counterfeit warriors, the quality of goods will improve at once.\u201dMr. Ji never set out to be a consumer rights activist. Born in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, he was so poor he could not afford to enroll in a university. His jobs have included running a carwash, selling clothes on the street and operating a late-night food stall.In 2000, a friend of his bought a children\u2019s educational compact disc that turned out to contain pornographic content. Furious, he and his friends \u201claid siege\u201d to the store where they had bought it, demanding compensation, Mr. Ji said. \u201cAt that time, I did not understand what defending your rights is,\u201d he said.Later, Mr. Ji bought a copy of China\u2019s consumer law and a manual on how to tell fakes from genuine products. From that point, he had a new career.On a recent week in October, Mr. Ji traveled to four courthouses in five days across China, filing lawsuits against shopping malls, accusing them of fraud for selling substandard goods. Based in the eastern city of Jinan, he says he goes to court about 100 times a year.Mr. Ji\u2019s work has earned him the enmity of counterfeiters and their thugs, who he says have beaten him up, bound his hands and feet, and telephoned him with death threats. In 2007, police in the southern province of Fujian detained him for 37 days, charging him with extortion, but released him.Still, Mr. Ji views the work as necessary. Every month, he says, he receives more than a hundred phone calls from people curious about how to get compensation from a fake product.On a recent afternoon, a man from the eastern city of Tai\u2019an called Mr. Ji, who was en route to check out a shopping mall in Beijing. How, the caller asked, could he emulate Mr. Ji?Mr. Ji told the aspiring fraud-buster that he could not \u201cjust casually enter any shop and buy eight or 10 pieces and demand compensation.\u201d His profession was built on navigating tricky relationships with local courthouses and police, Mr. Ji said, adding that recently some thugs from Tai\u2019an wanted \u201cmy life, my arms and my legs.\u201d\u201cNot everyone can be a counterfeit hunter. This industry isn\u2019t a gift that falls down from heaven,\u201d Mr. Ji told the caller. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the hardships and suffering we\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve only seen our glorious side.\u201dAn article on Thursday about China\u2019s rethinking of its methods to fight counterfeit goods misstated the given name of a hunter of fake goods. He is Yu Fengxing, not Yu Fengsheng.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
