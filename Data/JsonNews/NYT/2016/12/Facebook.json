The incident has been criticized by advocates of privacy and press freedom.He was ultimately denied entry, and he said though he was not given a reason, he was told his name matched that of a \u201cperson of interest.\u201d During the hours of detention, he was asked to describe how and why he had traveled to each country he had visited in the past five years, and questioned about whether he had seen anyone die.Agents requested access to his phones and to look through his photos so that they could make sure he was \u201cnot posing next to any dead bodies,\u201d he said. When he refused, citing the need to protect his sources as a journalist, they took the phones, he said.The phones were later returned and showed signs that the SIM cards had been replaced, he said. Giving up the contents of his private phone would be akin to a doctor giving up confidential patient information, he said.\u201cI\u2019m not going to open my phone for any other country,\u201d Mr. Ou, a New York Times contributor who was an intern for the news organization in 2010, said in a phone interview on Thursday from Nunavut, Canada. \u201cI can\u2019t be expected to do the same for the U.S.\u201dJason Givens, a United States Customs and Border Protection spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Ou\u2019s case, citing privacy laws. But he said agents had inspected 4,444 cellphones and 320 other electronic devices in 2015, amounting to 0.0012 percent of the 383 million arrivals.\u201cKeeping America safe and enforcing our nation\u2019s laws in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully examine all materials entering the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Givens said in a statement on Thursday.Agents made photocopies of several documents in his possession, including a personal journal, Mr. Ou said.It should have been clear to agents that Mr. Ou was a working journalist who had traveled freely to the United States in the past and had longstanding connections to American news agencies, Hugh Handeyside, a lawyer, wrote in the A.C.L.U. letter.\u201cWe believe that C.B.P. took advantage of Mr. Ou\u2019s application for admission to engage in an opportunistic fishing expedition for sensitive and confidential information that Mr. Ou had gathered through his news-gathering activities in Turkey, Iraq, Somalia and elsewhere,\u201d he wrote.Electronic privacy advocates said the episode illustrated a governmental loophole that\u2019s especially problematic for journalists but that could apply to anyone: Without a warrant, American border agents can legally search digital devices that they wouldn\u2019t be able to touch anywhere else.The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the Supreme Court carved out space for border patrol agents to examine personal property without a warrant, said Sophia Cope, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that defends civil liberties in the digital age.Security officers at United States airports don\u2019t need a judge\u2019s permission to search a traveler\u2019s backpack before he or she boards a flight the way a police officer would when stopping someone on the street. But it has to be for the narrow purpose of assuring immigration or security compliance, she said.The privacy implications of examining a cellphone are entirely different from rifling through a suitcase, which contains limited personal information, Ms. Cope said. The law regarding digital devices is \u201creally unsettled,\u201d she said.\u201cThe government is saying the old rule at the border applies to digital devices, even though our entire lives are on these devices,\u201d Ms. Cope said.The policy\u2019s assurance that agents would \u201cprotect that information from unauthorized disclosure\u201d is not particularly comforting for journalists, who fear the contents of their devices could unmask sources who would be in danger if the government learned their identities.Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said that for journalists like Mr. Ou who have worked in the Middle East to be treated with suspicion, potentially forcing them to break promises of confidentiality to sources just to enter the country, sets a poor international precedent, he said.\u201cIf this is requisite for journalists who are not U.S. citizens to enter the U.S., that is an enormous violation of press freedom,\u201d he said.Mr. Ou was assigned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to cover the Standing Rock protests as part of a project on indigenous health care in North America. He said the agents knew he intended to cover the protests, which have prompted the police to use rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannons against hundreds of people.His experience at the border led to an \u201cawful realization,\u201d Mr. Ou said: \u201cThat wall of na\u00efvet\u00e9 that I had about the freedom of the press in the U.S. kind of shattered at that moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was inspired by watching the film \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d to take dance lessons, but did not have a career in the arts in mind. To earn money, he drove a truck, among other jobs, while dancing for fun.When, in his late 20s, he saw a musical production at the Karamu House theater in Cleveland, he was inspired to ask for an audition. He met his future wife, Shirley Stollman, at the theater when they were cast in a play as a married couple.Mr. Latessa left Ohio for New York in 1959 to pursue his acting career, and made his Broadway debut at 38 in \u201cThe Education of Hyman Kaplan,\u201d a musical comedy, based on Leo Rosten\u2019s book, about an immigrant studying English in New York.In addition to Ms. Ortiz, he is survived by his partner, Jonathan Hilton; his wife, a writer from whom he was separated; two other daughters, Rachel Toomey and Gina Latessa; a sister, Antoinette Linden; two brothers, Donald Latessa and Gerald Latessa; and a granddaughter.Mr. Latessa also worked in television on shows like \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d and in films including \u201cStigmata\u201d and \u201cThe Last New Yorker.\u201dIn an essay in the book \u201cThe Alchemy of Theatre\u201d (2006), a Playbill publication, Mr. Latessa called himself a \u201cwilling collaborator\u201d who knew nothing about acting when he started and readily sought out the help of others. He viewed himself, he said, as a second banana who could carry a show if required, but who had been surrounded by enough stars to recognize his role.\u201cI try to enhance what the star is doing,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhile at the same time bringing something unique to my role. In \u2018Hairspray,\u2019 I would show Harvey affection. I\u2019d touch him. Hold him. Everybody said that the minute I walked onstage, they could tell that Harvey and I were in love. It provided the emotional foundation of the show.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary, using information from Mr. Latessa\u2019s family, omitted the name of a survivor and misstated his marital history.

Boyden GrayKathleen ClarkSome may argue that re-imposing the financial conflict statute on the president could cause disruption.  The president, like other employees, will have to divest from conflicting interests or avoid participating in particular matters that would enrich him.  But any disruption is justified by the \u201coverriding need\u201d to prevent the president from advancing his own interests at the expense of the public.  And a president-elect can prevent government disruption by divesting from conflicting interests.The president alone is responsible for executing the duties the Constitution assigns to him. Thus, a prohibition on conflicts of interest that compelled his recusal from certain decisions would impair his ability to fulfill those obligations. By contrast, no similar impairment occurs when Congress prohibits bribe-taking, perjury and the like. Of course, the mere fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest are lawful does not mean he should ignore them. The Department of Justice and the Office of Government Ethics have long taken the position that presidents should conduct themselves as if conflict-of-interest laws apply to them. I agree. By doing so, Mr. Trump can likely reap substantial tax benefits while removing a potent arrow from his critics\u2019 quiver and enhancing the legitimacy and staying power of his presidential actions.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " The convenience and ease of online shopping is expected to make online holiday shopping hit new highs in 2016 as consumers skip the crowds and capitalize on sales from the comfort of their couches.  According to Adobe Digital Insights, sales are expected to total $91. 6 billion over the 57 days of the 2016 winter holiday shopping season, an increase of 11 percent over the previous year. For the first time, shoppers are expected to visit retailers\u2019 mobile sites more than desktop sites as they browse for gift ideas at the time and place that suits them best.  But whether shoppers are buying online or in physical stores, the goal for retailers is to make the shopping experience as frictionless as possible. To that end, retailers have been testing various technologies to keep shoppers coming back to their web sites and brick-and-mortar locations.  For instance, imagine when you walk into a store, a robot ushers you through aisles to the items you want to buy. A smart mirror in the dressing room suggests the perfect boots for the jeans you tried on. And by using virtual reality goggles, you\u2019re able to see how a couch looks in your home \u2014 without leaving the store.  Retailers\u2019 goal is twofold: They want to chip away at the things that can make shopping a hassle \u2014 like long lines or dull dressing rooms \u2014 while adding more convenience and personalized service.  \u201cIf it\u2019s high-touch retail, you want to provide great experiences and entertainment,\u201d said Michael Klein, Director of Industry Strategy at tech company Adobe. \u201cBut if it\u2019s grocers or big-box stores, the technology needs to make that experience more seamless and efficient.\u201d  Retailers are using robots and other smart technologies to improve the in-store experience.  Some of these technologies are aimed at saving customers time, something that is a top priority for shoppers. In fact, according to a recent Forrester retail survey, shoppers ranked \u201csaving time\u201d as the top reason to use in-store technology.  One technology being tested is radio frequency identification (RFID) to embed data in clothing tags that allows items to be tracked throughout the stores. Zappos tested RFID last when it installed a Magic Checkout at an event in San Francisco. Shoppers walked over an RFID-reading mat, which scanned the RFID-tagged merchandise in less than a second. Through mobile payment, shoppers could complete the sale in seconds.  There are other uses for RFID, too. UGGs, for instance, is tagging its shoes in one store with RFID so that when shoppers step on a carpet, style tips and product information like \"what sizes are in stock\" pop up on a screen.  Retailers also are adding smart technologies to the oft-forgotten dressing room. Brands that include Bloomingdale\u2019s, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom are testing smart mirrors that do things like suggest shoes and other accessories. Shoppers also can see how they look in an outfit without trying it on.  The dressing room certainly is ripe for change. Seventy-one percent of shoppers who try on clothes in the fitting room become buyers, but only about a third step foot in dressing rooms to begin with, said Paco Underhill, a retail consultant.  \u201cDressing rooms are one of the few things that are different between online and in-store,\u201d said Andrew Hogan, a Forrester analyst. \u201cYou have the opportunity to make something that was a dead and isolated experience into something much more useful and exciting.\u201d  Merchants also are looking for ways to improve customer service \u2014 both in stores and online \u2014 by experimenting with robots with human characteristics.  While not common in stores yet, robots have huge potential for retailers: Technology experts predict that robotics and artificial intelligence will be in many homes by 2025 \u2014 the same time that experts expect them to become common on retail floors.  Orchard Supply Hardware, which is owned by Lowe\u2019s, is the first to use an autonomous robot on the retail floor.  The robot, called \u201cOSHbot,\u201d speaks multiple languages and is equipped with image recognition to help identify what an item is and guide customers to products in the store.  OSHbot has been successful so far. In the first six months, OSHbot helped 3,000 people with 3,500 searches \u2014 about what a human store associate would achieve in the same time period.  Retailers also are testing robots online through what\u2019s called \u201cconversational commerce.\u201d Chatbots simulate human conversation in the same way that Amazon Echo acts as a digital assistant. Most chatbots run in messaging apps like Facebook Messenger.  The Sephora beauty product store chain and the H&M clothing chain have launched bots on the Kik messaging app that can do things like pull together outfits based on preferences and commands a shopper types, such as \u201cleather jacket.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to have a conversation with a device that removes the friction that may occur when we\u2019re required to deal with humans or type in a whole bunch of information in a search box,\u201d Adobe\u2019s Klein said.  Retailers also are looking to enhance the shopping experience through virtual and augmented reality.  VR allows consumers to see what products in their homes would look like without leaving the store.  These are areas that retailers want to be in going forward. The VR retail market is expected to rise to $1.6 billion by 2025, according to a Goldman Sachs report. And AR could reach $30 billion in sales, as projected by a Digi Capital report.  Some chains have experimented with AR. Dippin\u2019 Dots, for instance, enabled customers in its loyalty program to make it rain Dippin\u2019 Dots in its stores through AR. And Walgreens added 3-D imagery to its in-store maps.  More big-name retailers are looking at VR, including Lowe\u2019s. The chain last year created the Holoroom, which allows customers to design their kitchen or bathroom space while in its stores, using an app. Then, by using virtual reality goggles, shoppers could step into the design.  Swedish furniture chain IKEA also launched a VR experiment this year, enabling shoppers to explore a kitchen where they can open drawers and change cabinet colors.  Experts say shoppers will continue to see more retailers testing these types of technologies. \u201cThings are moving fast,\u201d said Artemis Berry, vice president of digital retail for the National Retail Federation, a trade group.  And that means, 20 from years from now, shoppers may feel like they\u2019re living in the popular 1960s cartoon \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d with robots that cater to your every need, both in the store and online. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

He jailed thousands of political opponents and killed many others.But for all of that brutality and intolerance, he brought development and equality to a nation previously ruled by extreme inequality and corruption. Sons and daughters of illiterate plantation workers became doctors and teachers and contributed to large gains in human development, while corrupt officials and robber barons who had drained the old Cuba were forced to leave.Despite America\u2019s attempted invasion, multiple assassination attempts, he defied a superpower, his government survives successive American administrations, and, importantly, he died at 90 of natural causes. Love or hate him, we all wish we had a little piece of Fidel in us.He failed the test that Abraham Lincoln alluded to in his famous quote: \u201cNearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u201dFrom budding revolutionary concerned with overthrowing a corrupt dictator, he became what he himself despised.

He made it clear he is a businessman with lots of property around the world and a worldwide brand. He is the keeper of that brand, good or bad. His kids hold important positions in these businesses and apparently he knows a lot more people around the world than the media gave him credit for.Leave him be so he can get his administration put together.

One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include:The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members \u2014 which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Garfield said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.\u201dMs. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that \u201ccombine traditional education with the best of community colleges\u201d would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for \u201cnew collar\u201d information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election.There is no simple policy change that could spread tech\u2019s success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. \u201cWe look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,\u201d said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.Apple has already drawn the president-elect\u2019s scrutiny over jobs. \u201cOne of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late November.On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential.Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate \u2014 sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementDecember  9, 2016Gary LibecapChristine Todd WhitmanDuring the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump heralded the idea of eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. His proposed E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, frequently fought the agency as Oklahoma attorney general. But both may have forgotten that the E.P.A. was created by President Richard Nixon because people were being hospitalized in record numbers during bad air days and rivers were spontaneously combusting due to the dumping of pollutants into our waterways.  If cost-savings is our goal, we must remember that the cost of remediation is far more than prevention. The price we pay for ignoring these issues is much greater than we can afford, both in terms of dollars and human lives. We have seen a glimpse of an increasingly widespread concern for the environment in a number of recent campaigns. The sustained and widespread opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline, which would cross just upstream of the the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s drinking water supply, led the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the project and reconsider its route.While environmental protection may not have been the foremost issue animating Trump\u2019s supporters, it is important to a much larger segment of our population than ever before. Eliminating the E.P.A. altogether would be shortsighted and foolish; we need to take a longer-term view of the affects that our actions toward our surroundings have on our health and our safety \u2013 two resources that once lost cannot simply be repurchased.The American people did not elect Trump and other Republicans because they suddenly all joined the G.O.P., they voted because they wanted a change from politics as usual in Washington. President-elect Trump and congressional leaders should remember that the electorate voted against the hyper-partisanship that has rendered governing at the federal level almost impossible.  The new administration has the opportunity to make a huge difference by recognizing that the environment is not a partisan issue and real, everyday people, genuinely care about their health and quality of life.\nThere is angst in the environmental community about what President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s appointment of Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. administrator means for the agency and environmental policy. The fear is that recent efforts \u2014 ranging from implementing the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone of U.S. compliance with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, to redefining watersheds regulated under the Clean Water Act \u2014 will be rolled back or cancelled.  Broad objectives could be lost.While these two efforts might be critically modified, over all, environmental policies can be more realistic and less controversial under the new administration\u2019s E.P.A. If so, this will be good for the environment and society. Why is that? Environmental policy relies on interest-group politics.  Advocates and opponents provide information to the agency about benefits and costs of proposed programs.  Where interest groups compete, the agency receives balanced appraisals.  When they do not, the agency receives one view. Support for federal environmental policy is strongly associated with income, education, residence and political party \u2014 the same characteristics that statistically explain interest-group effectiveness. Where opponents are unorganized, poorer and lack information on policy proposals, they are less effective in lobbying.  As a result, environmental policies, even when portrayed as providing general public goods, can be favored by a well-organized few, but not by the broader electorate. Moreover the E.P.A. is unlikely to be a disinterested party. Staff identify with expanding their mission and the agency benefits from greater regulatory mandates that increase budgets and staffing.   Mixed political support is compounded by the way environmental policy works.  It primarily uses a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d rule, whereby parties who inflict environmental harm are fined or required to make costly production or consumption adjustments.  While there is a logic for this, the result is that those parties bear the costs of providing a public good. If these costs are high enough and the policies are not as broadly valued as they are by advocates, then environmental regulations are seen as being inequitable and economically damaging to certain constituents.  These parties are motivated to organize, and political push back occurs.  The E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan, for example, imposes direct costs on fossil-fuel producing regions \u2014 their communities, workers and mineral rights owners.  Lower-income consumers nationwide, as well as employees and firm/property owners in energy-intensive industrial areas are harmed.  These groups disproportionately bear the costs of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  A similar skewed distribution of benefits and costs applies to Clean Water Act extensions, where Midwestern farmers will have to pay fees or secure permits to cultivate near peripheral water, depending on \u201cstream\u201d definition under E.P.A. rules.  Again, overall benefits come at a cost to these parties.    It seems clear why both vague general benefits and policy costs and their unequal distributions have made the E.P.A. a flashpoint for many.  Political reaction undermines policy objectives. We have seen this in the response to free trade policies that are nationally beneficial, but inflict harm on certain groups and regions.  If the new E.P.A. changes this distributional dynamic through adoption of \u201cbeneficiary pays\u201d rules and other compensation to those who bear direct costs, the country may achieve more balanced environmental regulation.   \u201cBeneficiary pays\u201d shifts the cost burden to those who value the environmental policy more and hence, leads to a more proportionate distribution of benefits and costs.  Research has shown that these distributions are far more successful in eliciting the support of those who must take action to provide the environmental good.  And when advocates or advocate organizations have to pay, they more carefully weigh benefits and costs in setting objectives, then when the costs are off loaded to others.  Under those circumstances, we are more apt to get the \u201cright\u201d amount of environmental goods through regulation. We have experience with such compensation schemes and positive responses on a small-scale basis in payments to irrigators to fallow land or to line ditches, releasing the water for environmental instream flows. Similar incentive payments are used to pay fishers to reduce fishing to protect fish stocks. These schemes primarily have been used by nongovernmental organizations, such as Environmental Defense, Freshwater Trust and The Nature Conservancy. The new E.P.A. might learn from these experiences and adopt them more generally in devising and implementing policies that are more politically robust and successful in achieving long-term environmental goals.  Will Trump and his new E.P.A. chief have public support if they try to dismantle environmental protections?"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Culture, Not Its Companies, Dominates in China", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 The majesty of the Golden Gate, the windy chill of Alcatraz, the tourist hubbub of Pier 39 \u2014 Zhao Haoyu\u2019s itinerary for San Francisco had it all.Yet when Mr. Zhao, a Chinese tourist, arrived with his wife in September, they spent their first day wandering the humdrum suburban office parks that Facebook and Google call home.Joining a guided bus tour with a dozen other Chinese visitors, the two became part of the steady flow of Chinese tourists to Silicon Valley that represents \u2014 despite pervasive censorship and outright hostility from the Chinese government \u2014 the tremendous influence Silicon Valley wields in China.\u201cYou hear so much about these companies in China,\u201d said Mr. Zhao, a native of the southern Chinese city of Kunming who is in his 30s. \u201cWe just wanted to experience it.\u201dNeither prizes rebellion or disruption, so China\u2019s young entrepreneurs and investors have looked for guidance and inspiration in a place that does: Silicon Valley.China\u2019s tech world has copied the valley\u2019s innovator-meet-investor network of incubators, accelerators and venture capitalists. Start-up employees and leaders actively seek to question authority and think outside the box \u2014 two attributes widely discouraged in corporate China.\u201cI was having difficulty finding a partner who specializes on the technology side,\u201d said Mr. Yao, who estimated that he watched the movie more than 10 times in 2013 and 2014. \u201cI started to wonder how people in \u2018The Pirates of Silicon Valley\u2019 found their partners. So I watched the film over and over and learned a lot from it.\u201dAt times China seems to embrace Silicon Valley clich\u00e9s more eagerly than Silicon Valley itself.A prominent techie cafe in Beijing has a large wall with a timeline charting the initial public stock offerings of American tech companies alongside those in China. Some companies have created Apple-style product unveilings that are ticketed, cultural events. A developer in China is planning to start work on \u201ctech towns\u201d \u2014 planned communities where the innovative-minded can live and work together. Start-up offices often have open seating plans with office pets, foosball tables and a boss sitting with the employees.\u201cSilicon Valley has become a kind of beacon of cultural change in China,\u201d said David Chao, a partner at the venture capital firm DCM. \u201cHollywood could impact what kind of handbag a lady buys in China, but it never impacted corporate culture like Silicon Valley has.\u201dEven so, most Chinese companies have not fully absorbed the culture. Many are still highly top-down and bureaucratic, and open office plans often mask more deeply conservative customs. In place of California\u2019s sunny suburbs, China\u2019s innovation hub sits in the traffic and smog-choked northwestern part of Beijing, crammed into office towers above malls that sell all manner of electronics.The trend is nonetheless driving young people to take more risks and demand more from employers, even as it brings with it a problem familiar to Silicon Valley: hangers-on more interested in being a part of the scene than anything else.\u201cThere are people choosing technology not because they love it or want to do a start-up,\u201d said Jesse Lu, a Chinese entrepreneur who spent time at Y Combinator, a prominent start-up accelerator in the United States. \u201cThey just do it because they enjoy the lifestyle of a start-up. They enjoy choosing their hours, having small teams, not listening to anybody, doing what they think is right. It\u2019s a new fashion.\u201dSilicon Valley seems largely unaware of its cultural influence in China and appears to do little to cater to it.Last year, Facebook fired an enterprising Chinese employee who played to the unmet demand and charged one group of tourists $20 each to tour the campus and eat in the company\u2019s cafeteria. Now, the only thing notable for tourists to see is its thumbs-up sign.In Mountain View, Mr. Zhao and the tour group snapped photos of a cluster of brightly painted plaster statues designed after various Google corporate mascots. Next door is Google\u2019s visitor store, a sort of swag graveyard set up in converted office space where the company sells all manner of clothes and trinkets \u2014 including Frisbees and water bottles \u2014 imprinted with the Google logo.\u201cThey used to not let our buses on the campus, but now they built this area where we can come and take pictures,\u201d said Ken Guan, the leader of the tour group.\u201cPeople are surprised,\u201d he added. \u201cThey think it will be a booming commercial area, but it\u2019s just a bunch of offices.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland Fire Leads to Crackdown on Illegal Warehouses Nationwide", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byCities are calling on neighbors to report buildings they suspect might be giving parties like the one that took place the night of the fire at an Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, while concert promoters report a broad crackdown on illegal spaces around the country.\u201cI knew there would be this wave, but it happened a lot faster than I thought,\u201d said Forest Juziuk, a Detroit-based booker for electronic musicians like those who played at the warehouse where the fire occurred. \u201cBy Tuesday night I started seeing text messages from around the U.S. about fire marshals coming through and eviction notices being served.\u201dOver the past few decades, many of America\u2019s once-gritty cities have seen a profound revitalization in which decaying industrial buildings have been turned into residences, artists\u2019 lofts and gallery spaces. These buildings often serve as sources of affordable housing and profit, while providing walls and stages for an underground circuit of artists and musicians.\u201cYou have spaces that are not being used in a particular area, and urban entrepreneurship fills the space,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities. \u201cIt\u2019s something we love about cities, but it\u2019s a constant battle between urban creativity and the attempt of regulators to impose controls on it.\u201dThe warehouses in Oakland are similar to ones nationwide that struggle with this dynamic. Residents of several illegally occupied warehouses, some who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of eviction, reported landlord visits, insurance inspections and 60-day eviction notices being handed out to friends in the past few days.\u201cThey deemed our place unsafe and that it was not up to code,\u201d he said.Roman Clark, a spokesman for the Baltimore Fire Department, said a complaint on Monday had prompted the investigation. Both the Fire and Housing Departments investigated the building and found numerous safety and housing violations.\u201cThe Housing Department condemned the building and boarded it up,\u201d Mr. Clark said.No city officials are going to say they approve of illegal parties held in decrepit warehouses, but some acknowledge privately that underground spaces are part of how cities work and are likely to remain so.In the aftermath of the Oakland fire, Mayor James Kenney of Philadelphia and the commissioner of the Department of Licenses and Inspections sent out a joint news release calling on warehouse owners and managers to make sure their spaces are safe.The city\u2019s Office of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy said in a statement that it \u201cunderstands that artists are resourceful in identifying spaces that meet their distinct, creative needs,\u201d adding, \u201cour priority remains their and the public\u2019s safety.\u201d\u201cWe are concerned about exactly what happened in Oakland,\u201d said Karen Guss, a spokeswoman for the Licenses and Inspections Department, but \u201cthere is no way this city or any city of size is going to be able to address these issues on their own.\u201dNew York also has a long history of transforming buildings and warehouses into arts and music spaces. But gentrification of the areas most fertile to the enterprise \u2014 like Bushwick, an industrial pocket of Brooklyn \u2014 means that semipermanent spaces similar to the Ghost Ship have become rarer.In interviews, warehouse dwellers from around the country said they were well aware that their living choices posed a risk. And yet they stay, because the rent is cheap and because there are not many legitimate housing options where they can play drums, fix motorcycles or use a blowtorch, 20 feet from their beds.\u201cPeople will always seek what spaces like Ghost Ship offer,\u201d Aaron Muszalski, an artist who has spent the past two decades living and working in warehouses across the Bay Area. \u201cWhat we need are solutions that don\u2019t seek to eradicate these spaces, but which allow them to come safely into the light and support them economically in becoming safer and more accountable \u2014 something that is impossible so long as we pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u201dFor now, however, Oakland artists are hunkering down. Fearing eviction, they have tried to impose a sort of collective media blackout by encouraging anyone talking about the fire to make their social media posts private or to refrain from posting entirely.\u201cPlease don\u2019t name or draw attention to other artist housing in our community,\u201d read a post on one private forum. \u201cThe last thing we need is more members of our community thrown out on the streets.\u201dOthers are trying to mitigate the safety risks, but, true to form, they are organizing their efforts in the same manner as they might an underground techno show: in private, with discretion and the hope that it can all be handled in-house.In private Facebook groups and at an impromptu town hall meeting of warehouse dwellers that was held Wednesday night in Berkeley, Calif., residents exchanged advice with neighbors on how to arrange discreet inspections or buy fire extinguishers.\u201cThis is for all of us who understand that the fire in Oakland was not an unlikely accident, but rather an inevitability given the dangerous precarity of the spaces in which underground D.I.Y. culture exists nationally,\u201d Ms. Frost wrote in a post introducing the site. \u201cThis is for everyone waiting to see these communities flourish and wanting to see to it that this does not happen again.\u201dSarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting from New York.

As a band we\u2019re into trying to advance our instruments \u2014 sometimes to a bizarre degree \u2014 which obviously puts some people off.\u201dMr. Lake sang lead and played bass and guitar with Emerson, Lake and Palmer. He also produced several of the group\u2019s enormously successful albums, contributed most of the lyrics and, with Mr. Emerson, wrote the music for many of the songs.King Crimson was formed when Robert Fripp, a childhood friend whom Mr. Lake had met when both took lessons from the same guitar teacher, asked him to play bass and sing with a group he was trying to put together from the remnants of the failed trio Giles, Giles and Fripp. The group, whose orchestral sound incorporated a wide variety of styles, scored an immediate publicity coup by performing on a bill with the Rolling Stones in a free concert in Hyde Park in London in July 1969 with some 400,000 people in attendance.In a lull before one of the shows, they traded riffs. \u201cGreg was moving a bass line and I played the piano in back, and zap! It was there,\u201d Mr. Emerson told the magazine Classic Rock in 2002. Mr. Palmer, formerly with the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster, joined them on drums.The group started with a bang, appearing with the Who and Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1970 and signing immediately after with Atlantic Records. Its albums \u201cEmerson, Lake and Palmer,\u201d \u201cTarkus,\u201d \u201cTrilogy\u201d and \u201cBrain Salad Surgery\u201d all went platinum.After Emerson, Lake and Palmer broke up in 1979, Mr. Lake recorded the solo albums \u201cGreg Lake\u201d (1981) and \u201cManoeuvres\u201d (1983). He performed briefly with Asia, a progressive-rock supergroup, and with Mr. Emerson and the drummer Cozy Powell in the short-lived Emerson, Lake and Powell.He reunited with his old bandmates to record the album \u201cBlack Moon\u201d in 1992, but friction among the members made reunion tours and concerts difficult to organize. The group performed for the last time at the High Voltage Rock Festival in London in 2010.Mr. Lake is survived by his wife, Regina; a daughter, Natasha Atkins; and a grandson. He had recently completed a memoir, \u201cLucky Man,\u201d to be published in Britain next year.Mr. Emerson was found dead in March in his home in Santa Monica, Calif., with a gunshot wound that was self-inflicted.

{"Headline": "A Belated Farewell to a Pioneering Polar Bear Researcher", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "She was highly motivated, worked incredible hours, strove for perfection and was happy to debate everything I threw her way. She intended to work on coyotes in Westchester County but when I offered the opportunity to shift to polar bears in the Canadian Arctic she jumped on board and became fascinated with the project, the Arctic and especially the people. She spent many hours collecting traditional knowledge from members of both the Inuit community and especially the Cree First Nation.Linda was an excellent listener and her discussions with Cree elders were part of what ultimately set her on a course of using non-invasive techniques to study polar bears. Other researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of invasive techniques such as darting and tagging is anathema to the aboriginal worldview.To meet this challenge, Linda acquired one of the loves of her life. Quinoa is a Dutch Shepherd that she trained from a 6-month-old pup to seek and find polar bear scat. Despite scientific \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperts\u00e2\u0080\u009d who claimed she would find nothing (many of them still feel polar bears \u00e2\u0080\u009cfast\u00e2\u0080\u009d), she and Quinoa found more than 1,200 piles of scat in three years.She brought the samples to the American Museum of Natural History and painstakingly sorted each to identify and quantify the contents. Those data formed the core of her dissertation and allowed her to provide insights on several novel aspects of polar bear foraging and nutrition.Publishing scientific work through the peer review system is always difficult but even more so when your findings are at odds with popularized views. There is an unfortunate overtone in the world of polar bears that is powered more by opinion than hardcore science. Far too many that call themselves scientists and experts are actually advocates connected to not-for-profit organizations that fund themselves through public fears that iconic species such as the polar bear will soon go extinct. Linda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work focused on a simple theme \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are the bears actually doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009dTragically, her simple truth that the bears are \u00e2\u0080\u009cadapting\u00e2\u0080\u009d and trying to make the best of a changing situation struck a sour note with many of those who have influence over scientific journals.Linda, being the exceptionally determined individual she was, never yielded but sought advice from our late colleague Robert L. Jefferies (Dr. Bob) who told her: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay your course. Good science, properly done, thoroughly documented and well written, will ultimately win the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFortunately for polar bears and the rest of us, Linda took his advice, stuck to it and her papers began to flow. It is rare indeed that a graduate student displays that level of perseverance (and grit) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but that was Linda.Polar bears have become a symbol of the danger of climate change, but in the Western Hudson Bay, scientists have found that our understanding of climate change may not be as simple as it seemed.FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Romania\u2019s President Rejects First Female Candidate for Prime Minister", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 President Klaus Iohannis of Romania on Tuesday rejected a candidate for prime minister put forward by the country\u2019s largest political party, a decision likely to increase a rift between the president and the parliamentary majority.The Social Democratic Party, the country\u2019s largest party, had asked Mr. Iohannis to nominate Sevil Shhaideh, an economist, for prime minister. Had she had been selected and confirmed, Ms. Shhaideh would have been the first woman and the first Muslim to hold the office.Under Romania\u2019s Constitution, the president nominates the prime minister and the selection then goes to Parliament for approval.\u201cI have carefully weighed the pro and con arguments and I have decided not to accept their proposal,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Iohannis said, adding that he would ask the Social Democratic Party and its parliamentary allies to select a new candidate.The president did not explain his decision and his office did not reply to requests for a comment.Mr. Iohannis, who is a former leader of the National Liberal Party, the Social Democrats\u2019 main political rival, was elected president in 2014.\u201cShe seems to have liabilities linked to her husband and his vocal support for the Assad regime,\u201d said Paul Ivan, a Romanian former diplomat who is a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels. \u201cThe prime minister obviously has access to the highest level of classified information.\u2019\u2019According to Catalin Dumitru, a political consultant, Mr. Shhaideh\u2019s strong support for the Assad government could have caused problems for Romania in its relations with other countries.Romanian media outlets have also reported, relying on unidentified sources, that Romania\u2019s intelligence services were opposed to Ms. Shhaideh\u2019s appointment. Other reports have suggested that her lack of high-level experience may also have been a factor in the president\u2019s decision not to nominate her.Ms. Shhaideh was a surprise choice by the Social Democratic Party, which won more than 45 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections on Dec. 11. She served briefly as minister of regional development last year, but is not well known in Romania. Her selection appears to have been made primarily because of her close relationship with the Social Democratic Party\u2019s leader, Liviu Dragnea.Mr. Dragnea said he was surprised by Mr. Iohannis\u2019s rejection. \u201cOur opinion is that this man actually wants to trigger a political crisis in Romania,\u201d he said at a news conference.Mr. Dragnea is barred from the position of prime minister because he was convicted in April of election fraud and is serving a two-year suspended sentence.Mr. Dragnea indicated that he might seek to exacerbate the political tensions, saying he would consult with other party members about the possibility of impeaching Mr. Iohannis.\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy decision,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIf, following this assessment, we conclude that it is good for the country to suspend the president, I won\u2019t have any hesitation.\u201dThe opposition parties supported the president\u2019s decision to ask the parliamentary majority to propose someone else to be prime minister.\u201cIt is the exclusive constitutional attribute of the president to designate the prime minister,\u201d Alina Gorghiu, the former co-president of the National Liberal Party, said.The maneuvering is unlikely to lead to a political crisis, Mr. Ivan, of the European Policy Center, said.\u201cIt is the clear constitutional right of the president to nominate a prime minister,\u201d he said, adding that Ms. Shhaideh \u201cis unknown in the country and also doesn\u2019t have a power base in the party, so it is difficult to see why the party would fight for someone who doesn\u2019t mean much to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I think we regard this as a core tenet of our public service, which is to give the American people the real facts and information they can use to help make their decisions.When we heard Facebook was looking at ways to deal with the fake news issue, we were keen to get involved. And we have pretty deep links with our partners at Facebook. We\u2019ve done virtual reality initiatives with Facebook; we were the streaming source for the election. We have very good contacts there, and were eager to get on board.How will the partnership work?Obviously we have extensive fact-checking experience through numerous election cycles. So we\u2019ve formalized that team.We\u2019ve set up a team of about half a dozen people, and then they will draw on all of the ABC News verticals and our global reporting as needed to get to the bottom of what these stories draw on and what the American people need to know about them. It was set up in an ad hoc way during the election.Did you speak with Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, or who did you coordinate with at the social network?Our main partners are the people who run news partnerships at Facebook. There were certainly decisions within Facebook at a higher level about how they were going to approach this.Will there be any payment for this work? No. I think it\u2019s a genuine public service.We actually regard this as a big part of our core mission. If that core mission isn\u2019t helping people regard the real from the fake news, I don\u2019t know what our mission is.I think we all recognize that the reputation of the media isn\u2019t all that great, and it\u2019s been on all of us to address that and win that trust back.Do you think these moves will make a difference?It\u2019s a first step. I don\u2019t think any of us believe this alone will be the end of the fake news issue. But I think we\u2019ll learn from it and iterate.

{"Headline": "Aleppo Evacuation Effort Restarts, and Assad Calls It History in the Making", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 After months of fierce bombardment and failed diplomacy, the Syrian government began removing residents from the last rebel-held districts in the city of Aleppo on Thursday, a process that solidifies President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s control over the country\u2019s largest city.It remained unclear how many people, both civilians and fighters, remained in eastern Aleppo, but aid workers guessed it would take several days to get them out.If successful, the evacuation will return the whole city to Mr. Assad\u2019s control, signaling a major turning point in the nearly six-year conflict. Since early in the war, Aleppo, once the country\u2019s industrial center, has been split, with the government holding the west and rebels holding neighborhoods in the east.Rebels in east Aleppo had also frequently shelled government-held areas, killing civilians there, too. Many people on that side of the city considered the rebels dangerous militants and were glad to see them ousted.The United States, which has supported the rebels along with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, has struggled and failed to reach an accord to end the war, and the United States did not help broker the evacuation agreement.\u201cThere is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the indiscriminate and savage brutality against civilians shown by the regime and by its Russian and Iranian allies over the past few weeks, or indeed over the past five years,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said. \u201cThe Assad regime is actually carrying out nothing short of a massacre.\u201dThe loss of a foothold in Aleppo would be a major blow to the opposition, which would then hold sway in only one of Syria\u2019s provincial capitals, Idlib, where the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda is a major force. The less territory the rebels hold, the harder it is for the United States and its allies to get the Syrian government to negotiate with them, the Obama administration\u2019s goal.Residents reached in eastern Aleppo on Thursday said they felt the gravity of leaving places where they had lived and suffered for so long. Some bid farewell to places and things they would miss, while others pondered why the opposition had failed.Realizing he would be leaving soon, Hisham Skeif said he had visited his family\u2019s home and sat by an old tree, where he thought about Native Americans and Palestinians \u2014 other peoples forced from their homes.\u201cI never understood such feelings until today,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my great-grandfather\u2019s land. It is not only my memories, but theirs as well.\u201dWhile he had participated in the uprising against Mr. Assad that started the conflict, he felt that it had gone wrong by resorting to arms. \u201cToday, hours before we leave, I say that our biggest mistake was carrying weapons,\u201d he said.Others assumed that as declared enemies of the Assad government, they would never be allowed to return and left messages for those who would come later.\u201cWarning! Do not destroy! There are things here that your children may benefit from,\u201d it read. Reached in a Facebook call on Thursday, Mr. Abualnaser said he had put the sign up because he had heard that government troops had looted other neighborhoods after seizing them from the rebels.\u201cThe situation here is better today and people are relaxed a little bit because all the shelling and airstrikes that we had yesterday have stopped,\u201d he said.Others appeared to be covering their tracks as they left east Aleppo. Television images of the rebel enclave showed rising columns of smoke, which activists said were because fighters had set fire to their headquarters and ammunition stores.It remained unclear how that issue was resolved.But evacuation efforts restarted Thursday morning, with apparent modifications to the plan.Syrian state news media reported that buses and ambulances had begun evacuating residents from two Shiite villages in neighboring Idlib Province that have long been surrounded by Sunni rebels.Messages posted to a WhatsApp group by an English teacher in Aleppo describe what he saw in the shrinking rebel-held territory, as Syrian forces and their allies waged an assault to retake the city.The two villages, Fua and Kfraya, were not originally part of the evacuation deal. The moves to evacuate people from the villages suggested that they had been added to the deal to ensure that people in eastern Aleppo would be allowed to leave.Live images on Syrian state television showed the line of green buses and ambulances emerging from the rebel enclave into a government-held area, and antigovernment activists filmed their arrival in rebel-held territory further west, where many evacuees broke into tears and ate apples and cookies handed to them.Under the agreement, civilians evacuated from eastern Aleppo can stay in government-controlled sectors or continue to rebel-held areas. Rebels may only go to other rebel-held areas.Most were likely to end up in Idlib Province to the west of Aleppo, where a rebel alliance that includes the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda dominates. Some aid workers feared that moving the Aleppo residents there would merely lay the groundwork for a future siege.\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen in Idlib, but if there is no cease-fire or political accord then it will become the next Aleppo,\u201d said Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy for Syria.When east Aleppo was besieged by government forces and their allies, the United Nations reported that more than 250,000 people were trapped there.But on Thursday, Lt. Gen. Viktor Poznikhir of the Russian military\u2019s general staff said that 900 militants had been killed in the recent offensive against the rebel-held neighborhoods and that more than 108,000 civilians had fled the area, including more than 3,000 rebels.Speaking to journalists in Geneva, Jan Egeland, the United Nations humanitarian adviser for Syria, said that an estimated 50,000 people had fled eastern Aleppo.The discrepancy in the numbers could not immediately be resolved.The United Nations has not been able to provide protection for those fleeing, he said, because its workers were not given access.\u201cWe have not been witnesses to atrocities that we know have been committed by all sides in this horrific war,\u201d Mr. Egeland added.The plight of those trapped in eastern Aleppo as supplies have dwindled and destruction has spread has caused anguish among humanitarian workers.\u201cIt took 4,000 years to build Aleppo, hundreds of generations, yet one generation managed to tear it down in four years,\u201d Mr. Egeland said.Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Inspiration for Art in the Betrayal of Privacy", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyLast month, a Berlin nonprofit group called the Tactical Technology Collective took over a gallery in Lower Manhattan. They installed wall-size screens and display cases and arranged glossy tablets on large tables. The walls were white, and the d\u00e9cor was minimalist. If you squinted, you could mistake it for an Apple Store. That was the point. The exhibit, which Mozilla helped produce, lured people in with the visual language of high-tech consumption. But instead of housing cool new devices, each display contained an artifact or a piece of art intended to school and shock visitors on how much (or little) we know about privacy and data security.There was an interactive demonstration on a widely used program called \u201cChurchix,\u201d a facial-recognition tool licensed to churches that records and logs the identities of people entering the premises. There was a book created by the artist Aram Bartholl of the five million passwords stolen in 2012 from LinkedIn (including my own), so thoroughly thumbed through that the spine had broken. A piece by Mimi Onuoha, \u201cThe Library of Missing Data Sets,\u201d showed a filing cabinet packed with information not readily available online, under headings like \u201cNumber of Mosques Surveilled by F.B.I.\u201d and \u201cN.S.F.W. Comments Trump Made While Filming \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\u2009\u201d It commented on the political implications of the knowledge we don\u2019t have access to \u2014 despite living in the age of on-demand information.Eight antennas collected information emitted by any Wi-Fi-enabled device that happened to wander past the gallery and beamed it to an enormous screen inside, a disturbing reminder of how easy it is to track people and how often we let it happen. My favorite display was a fitness band tied to a metronome, exactly the kind you would use to practice music. Called an UnFitbit, the low-fi hack was intended to help clever individuals goose their daily fitness scores. It seemed cute, the idea that you might want to cheat on how many steps you took in a day, but the display had a darker interpretation: It anticipated a future when insurance rates and health benefits might be tied to such rankings.To move through the Glass Room, as the exhibition was called, was to be reminded of the many ways we unwittingly submit ourselves and one another to unnecessary surveillance, with devastating consequences. \u201cA few years ago, everything here would be a \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 episode, but it is real,\u201d says Marek Tuszynski, a founder of the Tactical Technology Collective, which also does privacy and digital rights advocacy work. He told me that since the election, Americans have seemed more eager to protect their data. \u201cThere is a newfound urgency here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to feel like they have to stop using Facebook or their mobile phones, but we just want them to look at it differently.\u201dI left the Glass Room invigorated by the ways artists are exploring the dark side of our digital footprint. Artists\u2019 obsessions with technology are not new, but in the late aughts, the work tended to focus on the possibility of the medium, treating technology like a new tool rather than a sociopolitical framework. Browser hacks scrambled web pages, turning them into distorted images, and Facebook-oriented projects treated the platform\u2019s design as Dadaist.\u201cIt was that early millennial era, when the 20-somethings were defining their generation by its use of technology and social media without raising questions about privacy, data or corporate power,\u201d says Joanne McNeil, an artist and a writer who often tackles topics relating to the intersection of art and technology. Her theory is that because many artists \u2014 all of us, really \u2014 were so captivated by the initial promise of the internet, they were blinded to its potential problems. \u201cI think because it was so much a networking tool \u2014 they were friending curators, other artists \u2014 Facebook seemed necessary, rather than an institution to distract or antagonize.\u201dIn the earlier part of this decade, I myself fell prey to a similar infatuation. Technology impressed me so much that I didn\u2019t consider its implications. I remember once driving in 2007 out to Pacifica State Beach in California and spotting a billboard that advertised a free business directory from Google. Later that day, during a slow spell at the restaurant where I waitressed, I tried it. You dialed GOOG-411, and an automated service located the number you needed \u2014 a hotel, a home, a nail salon \u2014 and dialed it for you. It\u2019s hard to explain how impressive this was back then. Before smartphones and unlimited data plans became ubiquitous, GOOG-411 was an ingenious life saver, especially because it was free (its alternative, dialing 411, sometimes cost $2 or more per request). Google engineers were also using the service to help build a library of human sounds, in order to refine the company\u2019s speech-recognition system. Helping to build a robot seemed unbelievably cool at the time. But that was nearly 10 years ago, before I knew about all the ways in which seemingly innocuous data collection can turn insidious, how programs not so different from that directory have given rise to predictive policing, algorithmic biases and unthinkable privacy breaches.Each day, it seems, we now learn about some new way our supposedly locked-down information is being leaked \u2014 as happened recently at Yahoo, which lost control of millions of passwords. Terms of agreement are updated with disturbing details in the fine print. The maker of the note-taking application Evernote, for example, recently sent out a notice to its millions of users that its engineers would be looking at their data to improve its services. Although there was a way to opt out, the company warned that doing so could compromise future services. The outcry against the change forced the company to reconsider.Artists now seem to be tangling with and reflecting these dark undertones in their work. Roddy Schrock, the director of Eyebeam, a space for new media, recently noted in an interview with an art blog how artists have changed their approach. \u201cEyebeam was born at a time, in the late \u201990s, when thinking around technology was na\u00efve and utopian,\u201d he said. \u201cI think much current thought around technology is still na\u00efve, but no one even pretends that the outcomes will be utopic now.\u201dThat lack of pretending is now readily apparent. Friends of mine who attended Art Basel in Miami posted photographs of works like the \u201cSocial Security Cameras\u201d by Fidia Falaschetti, a series of security cameras whose outer casings had been replaced with the candy-colored logos of companies like Twitter, Google, Snapchat and Instagram. The cameras were a chilling reflection of our documentation-obsessed times, how our need for validation usurps our desire for privacy and the protection of personal information. Also at Basel was the work of a Shanghai artist who uses the handle Aaajiao, who installed a machine that printed out lists of websites blocked by China\u2019s firewall, reflecting the limits of the online experience in the country.And the New Jersey-based artist Sondra Perry recently had an incredible show in the Kitchen, a Chelsea performance space, called \u201cResident Evil\u201d that mixed video-game perspectives with bodycam and news footage that pushed visitors to think about how black bodies survive despite the threats posed by surveillance. Perry told an interviewer that she was invested in understanding how the power structures that govern the internet \u2014 which has essentially become a group of corporations \u2014 was shaping our sense of self and autonomy. \u201cWhen we think that we are trying to express ourselves, and we\u2019re being individuals,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re being individuals within a frame that is primarily to collect our data and sell us stuff.\u201dArtists have long urged cultural introspection by creating work that forces awareness of our current political and economic landscape. A clip of Nina Simone speaking about art\u2019s power as activism has been floating around the web more vigorously than usual in the last few months. In it, Simone has an air of urgency. \u201cAn artist\u2019s duty, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is to reflect the times,\u201d she says. She continues: \u201cWe will shape and mold this country, or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.\u201d Art has the ability to be a mirror, reflecting back to us the world as it is, even if we\u2019re not ready to see it. Artists like Perry, Falaschetti and Onuoha are trying to awaken us from our complacency, pushing us to look beyond the blinding dazzle of our devices.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Perhaps \u201980s revivalism was inevitable after a long period in which the culture was steeped in nostalgia for New York in the \u201970s (novels like \u201cCity on Fire\u201d and \u201cThe Flamethrowers,\u201d television series like \u201cVinyl\u201d and \u201cThe Get Down\u201d). Or perhaps the \u201980s have simply come to seem more relatable to our current moment because Wall Street then, too, wielded a disproportionate influence over the city\u2019s psyche \u2014 Basquiat facetiously painted in Armani. The hedonism of the \u201970s had given way to a new and necessary decadent rage (\u201cDie yuppie scum,\u201d as the rioters against East Village gentrification declared). The power structure of the Reagan years \u2014 repressive, phobic, money-loving, indifferent to the mounting horrors of AIDS \u2014 offered artists and activists something to beat their fists against, and whatever might have inspired these renewed reflections, their rebellions now seem very much worth revisiting.\u201cWhen I think back on that period of late \u201980s activism,\u201d Mr. Murphy told me, \u201cthe people who were really doing things were out every night; they were doing something every single night, inhabiting a whole downtown world of nocturnal animals. For young people who look at that period with some degree of envy, I\u2019d say, \u2018Well, now, here\u2019s your chance, now is the time to get into big rooms and see how people did it 30 years ago.\u2019\u201dIn the theater, some of what is emerging in the vein of \u201980s renaissance reminds us of what social networks really meant before they meant Facebook. A new play, \u201cStreet Children,\u201d which made its debut the other day at the New Ohio Theater in Greenwich Village, is set in 1988, among a group of young transgender women who inhabit the lower Hudson piers. The play looks at the bonds and sense of belonging formed during a chaotic and dangerous time when blood families routinely disavowed difference and the acutely ostracized moved to New York, in all its welcoming seediness, and built street families or \u201chouses\u201d \u2014 connections of profound, lifesaving intensity in the predigital age.When I asked James Lapine, who directed the production this time and the last, what inspired the revival, he mentioned the experience of taking his bright, well-educated 23-year-old assistant to see \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d Larry Kramer\u2019s important AIDS play. \u201cAt intermission she looked at me and said: \u2018Is this based on fact? I mean I know about AIDS, but I didn\u2019t know it was like this.\u2019 That made me think it was important to tell these stories now to the younger generations.\u201d All future activists need history lessons.Email bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s largely because Bridgeport\u2019s schools do not perform as well as the suburban schools, and property taxes are higher.What You\u2019ll FindWhat You\u2019ll PayThe median sales price for a single-family home through Dec. 8 this year was $260,000, based on sales of roughly 30 homes, according to Ms. Robinson. That price level typically buys an older Cape Cod on a small lot, she said. Twenty single-family homes were listed for sale on Dec. 8, ranging from a 1,100-square-foot Cape at $149,000 to a five-bedroom waterfront colonial at $1.195 million.The median sales price for multifamilies was $250,000, according to Ms. Rello of the Higgins Group; for condos, it was $113,750.According to data provided by Ms. Robinson, the median rent for a two-bedroom condo was $1,700 this year, up from $1,500 in 2010.The VibeThe SchoolsThe Commute Most peak Metro-North trains from the Fairfield Metro station are scheduled to reach Grand Central Terminal in 75 to 90 minutes.

Hotel Lease", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 The General Services Administration disputed House Democrats on President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s need to sell off his Washington hotel.\u25a0 Senators suggest Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser may not be eligible for a security clearance.\u25a0 Senate Democrats to Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for education secretary: Pay the fines for your campaign finance violations.A spokeswoman for the G.S.A. came right back and said no, it hadn\u2019t.\u201cGSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the President-elect to divest of his financial interests. We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature. In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.\u201dThat is quite a different characterization than the one House Democrats gave. They wrote:\u201cG.S.A. assesses that Mr. Trump will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, unless he fully divests himself of all financial interests in the lease for the Washington, D.C., hotel. The deputy commissioner made clear that Mr. Trump must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well.\u201dNo word yet from Mr. Trump about how he will proceed. Not even the G.S.A.\u2019s deputy commissioner of public building services has heard a peep in response.\u201cIn fact, the deputy commissioner informed our staffs that the G.S.A. has received no communications to date from Mr. Trump\u2019s business organization about this issue. This raises serious questions about how Mr. Trump plans to proceed.\u201dBut the G.S.A. is not exactly saying all is fine with the hotel. More like, let\u2019s wait until Mr. Trump is actually sworn in.Two Democratic senators are raising a new issue about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser: They are questioning whether he should be allowed to hold a security clearance, citing past investigations into charges that Mr. Flynn leaked classified information and into potential conflicts presented by a private intelligence firm he owns.His business, the Flynn Intel Group, has hazy ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government, and that \u201ccreates potential for pressure, coercion and exploitation by foreign agents,\u201d the two senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Personnel Management.He also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the network\u2019s lavish anniversary party in Moscow.In addition, Mr. Flynn was investigated, but cleared of any wrongdoing, in 2010 for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan.But it is Mr. Flynn\u2019s business relationships that remain unresolved. He has said he plans to step back from the Flynn Intel Group and let his son, Michael G. Flynn, run it, according to the senators\u2019 letter, which was provided to The New York Times before its release on Wednesday.But that still does not settle the issue, the senators said.\u201cAny share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the emoluments clause of the constitution,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. Shaheen wrote.Senate Democrats have found a new bit of leverage against Ms. DeVos, the Michigan Republican Party leader who will soon be considered for the cabinet post of education secretary: her unpaid fines for campaign finance violations.All Children Matter broke Ohio election law by illegally sending $870,000 from its national PAC to its Ohio affiliate. The state of Ohio levied a record fine against the group.But the debt remains unpaid, the senators said. And now a confirmation vote looms.Two billionaire Silicon Valley executives, Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, and Travis Kalanick of Uber, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s roster of major American business advisers.The addition of Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick to Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum bring big technology names to the inner circle of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition that has had little engagement so far with Silicon Valley, except for the vocal support of the tech investor Peter Thiel.Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick engaged closely with the Obama administration, and their companies have increased their lobbying presence in Washington in recent years. Mr. Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, and his other firms, including Solar City and SpaceX, have been criticized by rivals for using federal and state subsidies. Uber, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s ride-hailing business, has roiled the taxi industry and fought municipalities around the world for new regulations that allow it to operate.The forum, which includes the heads of Walt Disney and General Motors, will be led by Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and co-founder of the investment firm the Blackstone Group, the Trump transition team announced Wednesday. The group is charged with providing Mr. Trump with their individual views on how regulations affect jobs and economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the tech sector has been tense. His election was greeted with dismay by many in Silicon Valley, who supported the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the internet policy of net neutrality, and an increase in the immigration of highly skilled workers. Mr. Trump has promised to unroll all of those efforts.Mr. Trump singled out Apple for manufacturing parts of their devices abroad. He also criticized Amazon for its dominance, and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for owning The Washington Post, which he said had been unfair in its campaign coverage of him.The announcement that Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick were joining his business policy group came ahead of a meeting with several tech leaders at Trump Tower on Wednesday, including Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.To Mr. Trump, the job of the president is to focus on jobs. Virtually everything else is subservient to that: diplomacy, science, conservation.On Wednesday, he officially tapped former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to lead the Department of Energy, an agency whose primary tasks are to maintain the safety and reliability of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, counter nuclear proliferation, clean up Cold War radiation contamination and pursue basic science through the government\u2019s premier research laboratories.\u201cAs the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy,\u201d said President-elect Trump. \u201cMy administration is going to make sure we take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation.\u201dAfter a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday night, he thanked Wisconsin and reiterated his jobs message.It is the prism through which his selection of the Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex W. Tillerson for secretary of state, the Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder for labor secretary should be seen.As Mr. Trump prepares to meet with Big Tech, 19 organizations from the music industry, including the Americana Music Association, sent him a letter expressing their concern about content theft over shared platforms.Mr. Trump is familiar with musicians\u2019 concerns about using music without permission \u2014 he was criticized during his campaign by artists who did not want their songs played at his rallies.Mr. Stepien is now the leading contender to be the White House political director.Two people close to the transition said that Mr. Stepien, who was hired by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, after the final campaign shake-up, has been repeatedly mentioned for the role, although the decision is not final.Bridgegate aside, Mr. Stepien is credited by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers with helping him improve his field organization in crucial states, and contributing to his victory.Mr. Trump has chosen (who else?) a television star to sing the national anthem at his inauguration on Jan. 20.Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old singer who gained popularity as a contestant on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d said on Wednesday that it was \u201ca great honor\u201d to be asked to perform by Mr. Trump.Ms. Evancho met Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2011, after she had finished as the runner-up on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d NBC\u2019s hit series.

{"Headline": "The Problem With \u2018Self-Investigation\u2019 in a Post-Truth Era", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsAt first, it sounds like a useless neologism: Aren\u2019t all investigations self-investigations? But in today\u2019s morass of disinformation \u2014 the \u201cpost-truth era\u201d \u2014 the phrase reveals a radical new relationship between citizen and truth. Millions of people like Welch are abandoning traditional sources of information, from the government to the institutional media, in favor of a D.I.Y. approach to fact-finding. What they are doing is not quite investigating. It is self-investigating.The phrase twins the American virtues of truth-seeking and individual resolve and suggests, at least superficially, an appealing, bootstrapping approach to information gathering. But an investigator tries to get to the bottom of things. For the self-investigator, there is no bottom, in large part because self-investigation \u2014 as I am defining it here \u2014 is confined to the internet. Proceeding from the assumption that the so-called experts are not to be trusted, self-investigators are pushed and pulled by the churn of memes and social media, an endless loop of echoes, reflections and intentional lies. With only themselves and their appetites as a guide, they bypass any information that doesn\u2019t suit their predisposition and worldview. The self-investigator\u2019s media diet is like an endless breakfast buffet, only without the guilt: Take what you want, leave what you don\u2019t.Farah had floated plenty of specious arguments in the past, among them the claim that gay men orchestrated the Holocaust and that Muslims have a 20-point plan for conquering the United States by 2020. But the Farah campaign that captured Trump\u2019s imagination held that America\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama, might have been born outside the United States. Trump talked about this notion almost nonstop; he even said he was considering sending private investigators to Hawaii to prove that the president\u2019s birth certificate was a forgery.Farah later said he was surprised that a \u201cmultibillionaire\u201d would make so much time for a side project like this. But single-minded persistence is the essence of self-investigation. Trump, for instance, also continued to insist on the guilt of the Central Park Five \u2014 five teenagers, four black and one Latino, whose convictions in the 1989 rape and beating of a jogger were later overturned \u2014 long after they had been exonerated by DNA evidence and the detailed confession of a serial rapist. Indeed, when Trump finally decided to let the birther issue go at an event at his new Washington, D.C., hotel in September, he also accused Hillary Clinton of starting the whole controversy. He was closing one self-investigation but providing fresh fodder for another.The great promise of the internet was that it would bring democracies together, giving more people more access to more information, all beyond the control of any single authority. Curious citizens could develop a more nuanced understanding of what was going on; voters would be better informed; we would ferret out the truth from the bottom up and greater freedom would be the inevitable result. Way back in 1993, the activist computer programmer John Gilmore argued that the internet \u201cinterprets censorship as damage and routes around it\u201d; as recently as 2011, activists still held out hope that access to Facebook and other social media could help bring about a peaceful revolution in the Middle East.But somewhere along the way, the democratization of the flow of information became the democratization of the flow of disinformation. The distinction between fact and fiction was erased, creating a sprawling universe of competing claims. The internet can\u2019t route around censorship when the people who use it remain in their own closed information loops, which is nothing more than self-imposed censorship.A universe of competing claims is the perfect environment for the rise to power of a politician who has made a career of championing his own truths and manufacturing his own realities. Not that Trump will be our first president who likes to operate from a closed loop. Richard Nixon was broadly dismissive of the State Department and the \u201cIvy League liberals\u201d at the C.I.A., relying instead on the wisdom of J. Edgar Hoover, the more like-minded head of the F.B.I.Preserving the flexibility to pick and choose facts carries obvious strategic benefits. In the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, President Bush and his senior aides wanted to be sure they received the intelligence they needed to justify their case for going to war in Iraq. They accomplished this by dismantling the information-filtering process that had been in place for decades. In its place, they created so-called \u201cstovepipes\u201d that fed raw intelligence from the field directly into the White House, thus routing around layers of professional analysts. Those bypassed analysts might have noted that much of the intelligence underpinning the administration\u2019s assessment of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction came from completely unreliable sources. Or they might simply never have passed on the intelligence in the first place.In the age of Trump, data and evidence are just some unwanted roughage down at the end of the buffet. Bush may have taken a selective approach to intelligence, but Trump, in his ongoing self-investigations, ignores it altogether, rejecting the daily national-security briefings traditionally provided to presidents-elect by the C.I.A. Even speaking under the cover of anonymity in a completely unguarded moment \u2014 is there such a thing as a guarded moment for Trump? \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to imagine him drawing a line between \u201cthe reality-based\u201d world and the conspiratorial world of self-investigation that he and his fellow travelers inhabit. It\u2019s a distinction that he doesn\u2019t recognize.Edgar Welch was different. At a certain point, he stopped looking at the internet. All his hours in the Pizzagate feedback loop ultimately drove him not deeper down the rabbit hole, but out into the real world, where he could do some primary research. He was concerned that something very bad was happening in that pizzeria in Washington. When he decided to check it out for himself, and maybe even do something about it, Welch the self-investigator became an actual investigator, albeit a badly deluded, dangerous one. What he discovered \u2014 though not before he had fired off a couple of rounds, frightening a lot of people and possibly landing himself in prison for several years \u2014 was that he had been gorging on a lot of lies. Or, as he later told a reporter for The New York Times, coining another memorable phrase for our age, \u201cthe intel on this wasn\u2019t 100 percent.\u201d That, at least, was 100 percent true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Condemns the Wrong Man", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byDealBookShe took aim at an individual she described as a \u201chedge fund billionaire\u201d who is \u201cthrilled by Donald Trump\u2019s economic team of Wall Street insiders.\u201dThe hedge fund manager she condemned was Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital. Ms. Warren \u2014 the fiery Massachusetts Democrat who is known for her stern mistrust of Wall Street \u2014 called him out by saying, \u201cTilson knows that, despite all the stunts and rhetoric, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to change the economic system.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe next four years are going to be a bonanza for the Whitney Tilsons of the world.\u201dThere\u2019s one rather glaring problem with Ms. Warren\u2019s attack: Mr. Tilson happens to be one of the few financial executives who publicly fought Mr. Trump\u2019s election and supported Hillary Clinton. A lifelong Democrat who was involved in helping to start Teach for America, Mr. Tilson also happened to be one of the rare Wall Street executives who had donated to Ms. Warren and actively sought new regulations for the industry. Recently, he gave Mrs. Clinton $1,000 so he could see Ms. Warren speak at a campaign fund-raiser. (He\u2019s also far, far from a billionaire.)Ms. Warren appears to be suffering from the same affliction that Mr. Trump\u2019s critics accuse of him: a knee-jerk, fact-free reaction to something she had read in the news.In this case, Ms. Warren seems to have come across a Bloomberg News article that includes some quotations from Mr. Tilson. But she didn\u2019t read to the bottom or dismissed it before firing off her zingers.The part Ms. Warren may have missed toward the bottom was this: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Dodd-Frank, I think banking should be boring,\u201d he was quoted as saying, where he was also identified as a Clinton supporter. \u201cI worry about Wall Street returning to being a casino.\u201dIn fairness, depending on how you look at the situation, it is possible some readers and supporters of Ms. Warren will give her kudos for criticizing one of her own well-heeled donors. \u201cShe can\u2019t be bought,\u201d might be a generous way to consider the situation. But even a quick Google search of Mr. Tilson\u2019s involvement in the recent political discourse over financial reform would reveal what he clearly meant by his quotation: that he was nervous about Mr. Trump appointing reckless and uninformed people to guide financial policy and that he was heartened that he had not.As Ms. Warren has made clear, she abhors the idea of anyone who has worked in the financial industry working in government on policy that could affect the economy and Wall Street. This column has covered what I\u2019ve described as her misguided view.That\u2019s not to say any administration wouldn\u2019t benefit from bringing in some outsiders who could offer new and different perspectives, but that can\u2019t be a qualifying measure. The next time you need heart surgery, do you want to go to a heart surgeon or a psychologist?In fairness, Ms. Warren\u2019s ambitious efforts to overhaul financial regulation are not without merit: There are large parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that have done a ton of good to protect the American public. She played a hugely important role recently in grilling the chief executive of Wells Fargo about his bank\u2019s sham-accounts scandal, and her questioning appears to have helped bring about his resignation. And at a time when one party is in power \u2014 in this case, the Republicans \u2014 Ms. Warren\u2019s position is even more important to help hold our leaders accountable.However, her ad hominem attack on Mr. Tilson only serves to undermine her credibility and some of the good work she wants to achieve.To make matters worse, Mr. Tilson\u2019s wife, Susan Blackman Tilson, was one of the students in the first Harvard Law School bankruptcy class that Ms. Warren taught, in fall 1992. The student has remained loyal to her professor; Mrs. Tilson wrote in a letter to Ms. Warren last week that she had been \u201ccheering from the sidelines as you rose to national attention for your excellent work on behalf of consumers.\u201dBoth of the Tilsons sent letters to Ms. Warren last week, which they shared with me, seeking to set the record straight and asking her to remove her Facebook post.The response? An aide emailed them: \u201cShe asked me to relay to you that she is removing the word \u2018billionaire\u2019 from the post, as you have indicated that is factually inaccurate. The senator has decided, however, not to remove the overall post.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Warren declined to comment on the exchange.When I spoke to Mr. Tilson on Monday, he said he felt that the senator had let him down in two ways: \u201cPersonally, I feel betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent years, I\u2019ve really stuck my neck out by very publicly supporting her, the C.F.P.B., and a tough regulatory approach to banks \u2014 none of which wins me many friends \u2014 and this is how she repays me.\u201dMr. Tilson added: \u201cBy engaging in factually incorrect, ad hominem attacks, she\u2019s getting down into the gutter with Trump. This is misguided and counterproductive.\u201dDespite all of that, he said, \u201cI still support her because I share her belief that banking should be boring.\u201dNaturally enough, he added, her Facebook post, coupled with her response, \u201ccertainly reduces my enthusiasm for her.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Day for Gay Plays?", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byNo one would argue that gay men and women continue to face the kind of discrimination they did back in 1968, when Mart Crowley\u2019s \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d cracked open the closet door onstage, shining a stark light on what was then a topic rarely explored in popular culture.The play has remained a landmark \u2014 both derided as rife with stereotypes and embraced for its honesty about the internal battles gay men faced at a time when homosexuality was still considered a psychiatric disorder.But what\u2019s perhaps surprising is how the themes it explored continue to crop up in dramas and comedies about gay life as the play\u2019s 50th anniversary approaches. The image of the lonely gay man searching fruitlessly for love, quipping through the tears or not, continues to stalk the stage. (Only two of the play\u2019s eight gay characters are partnered \u2014 and their relationship is riddled with tension.)Portraits of gay life in mainstream culture are no longer rare; they have been proliferating for decades. As a result, no one play (or movie) bears the burden of either seeming to affirm, or attempting to negate, stereotype. You might argue that it\u2019s a sign of progress that these writers felt no compunction in writing about troubled, lonely gay characters. Nobody seeing any of these plays today would come away assuming it represented the sum total of gay men\u2019s experience.The opening up of gay culture to the world over the past 50 years, and the gradual but now solidified acknowledgment of homosexuality as not a chosen \u201clifestyle,\u201d has been reflected in innumerable plays and movies. A play about gay men\u2019s relationships is no more seen as an \u201cissue\u201d play than one about straight people\u2019s relationships.Seen today, William Finn and James Lapine\u2019s richly funny musical seems prescient about the changing mores of the culture. It depicts an unconventional family that, strangely shaped though it is, is very much a family. Christian Borle and Andrew Rannells play Marvin and Whizzer, a gay couple who remain closely tied to Marvin\u2019s ex-wife, Trina, played by Stephanie J. Block.All three qualify as parents to Jason, as does Trina\u2019s therapist-turned-lover, Mendel (who happens to also be Marvin\u2019s therapist, too). The tone might be described as peppy-neurotic, at least until it darkens into heart-rending in the second act, when Whizzer comes down with a mysterious illness \u2014 not yet named \u2014 that we know is AIDS.After rereading \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d and reflecting on gay-themed plays today, I of course noted the glaring differences. What\u2019s most crucially changed is that the men depicted in the newer plays, even dating back to \u201cFalsettos,\u201d are not huddled in a subculture walled off from the rest of society. In Mr. Crowley\u2019s play, the arrival of a central character\u2019s straight college buddy sends him into a frenzy of anxiety \u2014 something that would seem absurd in a play set today or even 20 years ago.It is unquestioned that these characters are included in the wider culture, with friends gay and straight, living their lives not on the margins, and in most cases just as privileged as the straight people who populate most contemporary plays. (The American underclasses \u2014 straight or gay \u2014 are conspicuously underrepresented in our drama, but that\u2019s another story. As are, unfortunately, black gay characters.)Another element entirely, and happily, missing from today\u2019s plays is the boiling self-hatred that practically seared my hands as I read Mr. Crowley\u2019s play. It climaxes, in fact, with a speech in which one character denounces another\u2019s vicious behavior toward his friends as an expression of the contempt he feels for himself, merely for being who he is.The characters in \u201cA Life\u201d and \u201cHomos,\u201d \u201cBright Colors\u201d and \u201cSignificant Other\u201d and \u201cFalsettos,\u201d may still battle inner demons that result from growing up with an instinctive sense of their \u201cotherness.\u201d But they have not internalized it as self-hate and self-doubt; it\u2019s simply a psychic burden that plays little role in the struggle to find fulfilling lives and relationships.Still, the onstage persistence of the loveless gay man probably reflects some hard truths, even in a much-evolved America.Although the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of gay marriage, gay men and women continue to endure subtle (and not so subtle) burdens that heterosexuals do not. Some, particularly the young, still regularly feel the sting of stigma, resulting in introversion or isolation that, later, makes it harder to connect with others.Maybe that\u2019s why Mr. Seavey\u2019s \u201cHomos\u201d has continued to haunt me. Although it is primarily a play about two men forging a romantic relationship, a traumatic turning point comes when one is the victim of gay-bashing while walking through his Brooklyn neighborhood.An earlier version of this article misstated the closing date of the play \u201cBright Colors and Bold Patterns.\u201d It is Dec. 30, not Dec. 31.

{"Headline": "Investors Sharpen Focus on Social and Environmental Risks to Stocks", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byPfizer stock was riding high in June 2015, up 128 percent in five years, making it the second-most valuable American drug maker. Nine out of 10 Wall Street research analysts recommended that investors hold it in their portfolio, if not buy more.That same month, however, a different type of research firm downgraded Pfizer to its lowest rating, reflecting what it considered increased risks from factors that other Wall Street analysts typically ignore: environmental, social and corporate governance issues, or E.S.G.Investing based on so-called E.S.G. factors has mushroomed in recent years, driven in part by big pension funds and European money managers that are trying new ways to evaluate potential investments. The idea has changed over the last three decades from managers\u2019 simple exclusion from their portfolios of \u201csin stocks\u201d such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms makers to incorporation of E.S.G. analysis into their stock and bond picks.MSCI is perhaps better known for its global stock indexes, but its annual E.S.G. index and research revenues have been growing at 20 percent annually and should top $44 million this year, making the segment the firm\u2019s fastest-growing business.On Pfizer, MSCI\u2019s research noted the high volume of regulatory warnings that the company had received as of mid-2015, raising the risk of liability concerning five of its drugs. The downgrade caught Pfizer\u2019s attention, and its representatives met with MSCI officials to update them on legal issues like asbestos lawsuits, and about various drugs like Zoloft, Effexor and Protonix. MSCI kept its rating.The amount of assets managed using E.S.G. factors has more than tripled to $8.1 trillion since 2010, according to a report issued in November by the US SIF Foundation, which tracks sustainable investing. The TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund has doubled in size to a current $2.3 billion in the last five years. Exchange-traded funds linked to MSCI E.S.G. indexes have tripled to $3 billion in the last three years. And there has been a proliferation of E.S.G. index or research providers, including FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices and Sustainalytics, which helps Morningstar rate mutual funds on their E.S.G. factors.Surveys have shown that younger investors like the approach. Calls for fossil-fuel divestment linked to climate-change concerns have also raised awareness. Even the regulatory climate has shifted: The Department of Labor ruled last year that investing fiduciaries could consider E.S.G. factors in their investment decisions as long as they did not hurt expected returns.Lisa Woll, chief executive of US SIF, said that even if a Trump administration \u201crolls back progress\u201d on some environmental and social issues, the field over all \u201cis likely to continue to grow based on demand by a wide range of investors.\u201dAssembled through acquisitions between 2009 and 2014, the MSCI E.S.G. ratings \u201chave come to be the market standard for E.S.G.,\u201d said Amy Orr, the director of capital markets at the Heron Foundation, which pursues an anti-poverty mission.On a recent morning last month, standing before a computer screen elevated by black metal stilts for videoconferencing, Ms. Lee conducted calls with MSCI analysts in Mumbai, Tokyo, Beijing and Massachusetts to consider a few possible ratings changes.They first considered whether a Chinese steel company, Fosun International, should be upgraded because it was moving into financial services and would have lower exposure to toxic emissions. \u201cWe approve, including the rating upgrade. Thanks, Xiaoshu,\u201d Ms. Lee said to her analyst.Next was a downgrade of ENN Energy Holdings, a natural gas pipeline distributor in China that had carbon emission issues and what a utility analyst in Tokyo, Kenji Watanabe, called a \u201cweak board composition.\u201d But a downgrade was deferred for Bollor\u00e9 S.A. \u2014 a French transportation company that recently had a rail accident that killed 79 in Cameroon \u2014 pending an MSCI effort to reach the company.The MSCI ratings do not exclude all stocks in any given category, such as fossil fuels or tobacco, but rather rank each company against its peers based on how it manages E.S.G. risks.In oil and gas, for example, the Norwegian giant Statoil ranks near the top based partly on its record of spills and low emissions, while the American company Chevron ranks near the bottom with higher-risk operations, including forced shutdowns this year of a new $54 billion liquefied natural gas plant in Australia.The building blocks for MSCI\u2019s E.S.G. research came from acquisitions that included a governance ratings firm co-founded by Robert Monks, a pioneer in shareholder activism, and a socially responsible stock research firm, KLD Research & Analytics, which introduced the Domini 400 Social Index in 1990.The goal, Mr. Monks said in a recent interview, is to \u201capply something akin to classical security analysis to areas which have so far escaped consideration in valuing companies.\u201dPerformance does not have to suffer. Although the TIAA-CREF social choice fund and the flagship MSCI exchange-traded fund have trailed the market slightly for the last five years, the Vanguard fund has topped it. The $14.8 billion Parnassus Core Equity Investor fund, which picks stocks using E.S.G. and fundamental analysis, has beaten the market by more than two percentage points annually over the last 10 years.As E.S.G. becomes more popular, companies have become more responsive to MSCI\u2019s data-gathering efforts. Ms. Lee said the response rate had risen from about 15 percent in 2013 to a current 40 percent. Pfizer, for example, first got in touch with MSCI in 2014.The TIAA-CREF social choice fund, which aims to invest in E.S.G. leaders, does not hold several well-known stocks based partly on unfavorable MSCI ratings. Among those excluded are Exxon Mobil (for environmental impact management), Apple (labor-management relations and supply chain issues), Facebook (privacy and data security), Amazon (labor-management practices), and General Electric (labor-management practices, military contracting, weapons).With undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard, Ms. Lee came to MSCI through the 2010 acquisition of RiskMetrics Group, owner of the Innovest sustainability research firm. Operating from a 48th-floor glass-walled aerie opposite One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, she oversees 150 analysts who follow 6,500 companies in 14 offices worldwide.Some investors find data from MSCI and others helpful as a starting point beyond the narrower E.S.G. agenda. \u201cIt really helps us quickly understand whether there are business controversies or other risks \u2014 and opportunities,\u201d said Karina Funk, a co-manager of the $360 million Brown Advisory Sustainable Growth fund.For example, she said, her firm bought stock in American Tower, a cellular tower company, after Brown\u2019s own research found its tower-siting practices exceed standards set by environmental regulators or wildlife management groups, \u201cmaking them a preferred partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feminism Lost. Now What?", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Opinion\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me the lightning speed at which these issues have receded. The story is the total omission of women.\u201dSupported byThis was supposed to be the year of triumph for American women.A year that would cap an arc of progress: Seneca Falls, 1848. The 19th Amendment, 1920. The first female American president, 2017. An inauguration that would usher in a triumvirate of women running major Western democracies. Little girls getting to see a woman in the White House.Instead, for those at the forefront of the women\u2019s movement, there is despair, division and defiance. Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss was feminism\u2019s, too.A man whose behavior toward women is a throwback to pre-feminist days is now setting the tone for the country. The cabinet that Donald J. Trump has nominated includes men \u2014 and a few women \u2014 with public records hostile to a range of issues at the heart of the women\u2019s movement. A majority of white women voted for him, shattering myths of female solidarity and the belief that demeaning women would make a politician unelectable.More broadly, there is a fear that women\u2019s issues as the movement has defined them \u2014 reproductive rights, women\u2019s health, workplace advancement and the fight against sexual harassment, among others \u2014 could be trampled or ignored.\u201cWe need a \u2018come to Jesus\u2019 moment,\u201d said C. Nicole Mason of the Center for Research and Policy in the Public Interest at the New York Women\u2019s Foundation. \u201cI feel like the denial is very severe.\u201dIn the weeks after the election, in conversations with nearly two dozen advocates for women, I heard the fractures of a movement still regrouping after an unexpected defeat. They know that Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t stand for the feminist movement directly, and that you could vote against her without saying you were voting against feminism. But one of the movement\u2019s goals was shattering that ultimate glass ceiling. Some say the failure to do so was so devastating that now is the time to rebuild from the ground up. Others insist it\u2019s time to stay the course.The challenges are a proxy for the questions the Democratic Party must face over class, race, identity politics and tactics. The women\u2019s movement must balance how to broaden its message without losing its base. Courting the white working class could alienate black women still smarting over white women voting for a man whom many saw as racist \u2014 a choice that seemed to put racial identity over gender solidarity. Some younger women shun the feminist label altogether. It\u2019s not clear how far the tent can stretch without leaving some outside.The overall struggle is to stay relevant in the age of Trump. \u201cBefore the election, even I was stunned by the sheer number of people I knew who came forward saying they\u2019d been survivors of sexual assault,\u201d said Vivien Labaton, co-executive director of Make It Work, which promotes working families\u2019 economic security. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me the lightning speed at which these issues have receded. The story is the total omission of women. Overnight.\u201dHeather Booth, long active in the movement, notes that polls consistently show majority support for child care, equal pay, prohibitions against sexual discrimination and the right to abortion. Ms. Smeal\u2019s and many other groups have reported intensified mobilization, donations and volunteerism after the election. For many, the defeat may well be an awakening, a visible sign of barriers they thought had been swept away.But this consensus masks real struggles.Although exit polls suggest that a majority of young women voted for Mrs. Clinton, their enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders during the primary seemed to say that for some, feminism\u2019s traditional preoccupations seem out of date.In late October, when the polls indicated that Mrs. Clinton would win, I sought out young women to talk about their perceptions of her. Jessica Salans, 27, who is running for local office in Los Angeles in 2017, said she found Mrs. Clinton\u2019s feminism outdated, failing to prioritize climate change, income inequality and the toll of American intervention overseas.\u201cI saw a great documentary about the second-wave feminist movement, and it made me realize why people like Gloria Steinem were coming out in support of Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said. The brand of feminism that spoke to her, though, wasn\u2019t about breaking historic barriers. It was more specific: \u201cprogressive feminism, eco-feminism.\u201dTo many inside and outside the feminist movement, the Clinton campaign message missed the mark.\u201cWhite working-class women saw Hillary Clinton as another privileged white woman wanting to break the glass ceiling,\u201d said Joan C. Williams, professor at University of California Hastings College of the Law. \u201cThat metaphor makes sense if your central goal is to gain access to jobs that privileged men have. Hillary\u2019s feminism was not about them.\u201dFeminism, which at its heart should mean opportunities for women in every sphere, has also come to be seen as a proxy for liberalism, alienating conservatives.S. E. Cupp, a columnist for The Daily News in New York and a conservative who did not vote for Mr. Trump, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a condescension that comes across from some in the women\u2019s movement. There\u2019s this idea that if you\u2019re not liberal, you\u2019re a traitor to your gender. Is our message alienating entire groups of people, including women?\u201dShe raised the provocative possibility that many women believed that Mr. Trump would keep the country safe in part because of his paternalistic, alpha male persona \u2014 and that was an implicit rejection of feminism\u2019s attempts to redefine gender roles.Others worry that the women\u2019s movement has spent too much time policing language and behavior, blaming and shaming at the expense of dialogue. That, Professor Williams argues, can make misogyny attractive to the white working class, a way to rebel against condescending elites.The answer, some argue, is rebranding feminism \u2014 recasting issues in economic terms relevant to the working class, men as well as women.\u201cWhile the working families agenda is very strong, it\u2019s not big enough to get the country back on its feet,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster. \u201cIt needs to be embedded in a bigger economic message. Sometimes we talk about it in ways that make it sound like it\u2019s just for women, to the exclusion of men.\u201dBy contrast, she said, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic platform was clear and compelling. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s calls for equal pay, child care, paid family leave and health insurance that covered birth control and mammograms, paled before the appeal of someone who promised to bring back better-paying manufacturing jobs and restore a lost standard of living.The key is to link the two messages, to take issues that benefit women and show how they help families as a whole.Ms. Lake described a focus group on equal pay she conducted with white union members in Michigan. She found that men were enthusiastic if they connected it with their own economic security. \u201cOne guy said, \u2018If the little lady doesn\u2019t get paid the same as I do, I need to get overtime and there\u2019s no OT anymore.\u2019 \u201d The other men in the room, she said, agreed with him.Men may also be more receptive when the message is applied to their daughters. Reshma Saujani runs the group Girls Who Code, aimed at preparing girls for careers in technology. She noted that when her organization tried to persuade parents to enroll their girls, abstract appeals to gender equity fell flat. Evoking fathers\u2019 dreams for their daughters had more resonance.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your home but your daughter has a shot at going back up to the middle class,\u201d she said, explaining why that kind of pitch succeeded. \u201cWe have to talk to different parts of the country differently. We can\u2019t make the same gender arguments \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dIn these postelection conversations, the rawest wounds were expressed by black women who felt betrayed by white women\u2019s support for Mr. Trump. These women worry that the national chest-beating about identity politics and the resolve to win back the white working class will come at their expense, subordinating issues of racial justice.\u201cYou blame the people who voted for him, not the ones who didn\u2019t,\u201d said Salamishah Tillet, an associate professor of English and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania.Early organizers of the women\u2019s march faced scorn for initially failing to include minority women in leadership positions, then drew fire for the original name of the event \u2014 Million Woman March \u2014 which appropriated the name of a march by black women in 1997.\u201cAshes to ashes, dust to white liberal feminism,\u201d wrote LeRhonda Manigault-Bryant, associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College, in an impassioned open letter noting that white feminists now shared the kind of fears long known to black women.Rather than playing down race, these women argue it\u2019s essential to recognize its interconnection with feminism. Allowing racism to fester, they say, threatens not only black women but also white women, because it encourages white nationalism, which is also hostile to women\u2019s rights.But building bridges across racial and ethnic lines requires white feminists to understand that their experience is not universal, Professor Manigault-Bryant said. And it means defining women\u2019s issues as broadly as possible.One of the paradoxes of 2016 was that some referendums on issues dear to the women\u2019s movement passed on the local level, from tax increases to expand child care programs in Ohio to raising the minimum wage in four states. Advocates see opportunities in localities, a key battleground. The Michigan People\u2019s Campaign focused on a statehouse district called Downriver Detroit, dispatching campaigners door to door to talk across party lines about issues like caring for the elderly, disabled relatives and children. Their progressive candidate won the local election, although Mr. Trump carried the same district.Others see ballot initiatives as a potent weapon. \u201cMaybe this moment was tailor-made for ballot measures as a critical form of policy making and protest,\u201d said Justine Sarver, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. The center conducted polling in 11 states and found wide support for issues like equal pay, child care, paid family leave and higher wages, and is gearing up for the 2018 midterm elections.In the end, it\u2019s hard to argue that this election over all was a vote for the subordination of women. But it\u2019s a warning that feminism, as it has been defined, did not inspire enough people in enough places around the country. You didn\u2019t hear explicit calls for women to stay at home or be subservient to men, although it\u2019s an open question how many Americans are receptive to questioning traditional gender roles. Many who care about the place of women in American society are gripped by fears that men will now feel they have a free pass to demean women at home or in the workplace, that women\u2019s health, economic security and reproductive rights will be dealt severe blows.Talking to women who voted for Mr. Trump, I found many who were working, divorced or single, opinionated and outspoken. They saw Hillary Clinton as a menace and Donald Trump as an agent of change, if a flawed one. Many were living what might be called liberated lives.The challenge for the women\u2019s movement is to persuade more of the electorate that feminism is not merely a luxury for the privileged or the province only of liberals, but rather that it is essential to the freedom of every woman \u2014 and to her choices.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the company that conducted a poll on how many women identified as feminists. It is Lake Research Partners, not Lake Associates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Syria, With Love", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byModern LoveSecretly, irrationally, I already loved them. I loved them the way you love a future spouse you imagine for yourself, or how you love your children before they take root in your body and heart. These were people searching for safety, much as my Hungarian ancestors had tried to do in the 1930s before they were taken to concentration camps.At the mere mention of this family\u2019s existence, a kernel of worry and hope began to spin inside of me. And what is that if not the stirrings of love?I cleaned the refrigerator with bleach and picked crumbs out of a seal with a toothpick. My son and daughter, 10 and 5, brushed away cobwebs and wiped baseboards, while my husband tackled the bathroom. With the volunteers from the co-sponsoring church, my pagan family stripped the apartment of its errant Polaroids and refrigerator magnets until it became neutral, spare, a place of refuge.As the date neared, I thought of the empty refrigerator, reeking of bleach, and the cabinets, lined but bare, and took to Facebook with a plea for basics.The packages that began arriving on my porch daily were a salve protecting me from the increasing ugliness of the presidential campaign. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d I whispered as my PayPal account grew with money earmarked for food, diversions and educational materials.One donation labeled \u201cFor our Syrian friends\u201d was blocked as suspicious, and my heart raged. Then the donor tried \u201cFor our friends,\u201d and the donation sailed through. \u201cWe\u2019re stepping over you,\u201d I whispered to the electronic gatekeepers.My neighbor and I went to the international market with a downloaded grocery list. She has a Southern accent, blond children and a husband who throws baseballs in the street at dusk. Here we were buying Turkish coffee, dried beans, orange blossom water and Persian cucumbers.I posted photos of our grocery cart, and in came more donations.I went to Walmart with my children, where they helped me pick out a toy electric keyboard, art supplies, chalk and potted plants.On our porch, our neighbors left stuffed animals, bedsheets, pans and cutlery. We filled the apartment with all the things we hoped would telegraph our collective message: You are welcome here.While we cleaned and shopped, the family was being interviewed and inoculated in preparation for travel as refugees to the United States. We learned their names and ages. The father and mother, 36 and 28, were parents to a daughter and son, 11 and 9. Years earlier, they had left Syria on foot, with nothing, for Jordan. They had no idea anyone would be here to welcome them.On the day they arrived, we greeted them with a phrase we had memorized, \u201cAhlan wa sahlan\u201d: \u201cWelcome.\u201d They greeted us with a word they had memorized: \u201cHello.\u201dI showed them how to work the stovetop, the oven and the dishwasher. They smiled, bowing their heads. The mother, Ruwaida, looked like a woman who, after spending four years in limbo, had flown through the night from one country to another only to find herself in an apartment in yet another foreign city with strangers.\u201cHow long can we stay?\u201d she asked the translator.\u201cOne year in the apartment, for free,\u201d he said.She slumped with joy and relief. On the floor, two black suitcases contained all they owned.Every few days, I showed up with more donated items. At night, I read about Islam until I fell asleep.They learned \u201cthank you\u201d and taught me its Arabic counterpart, \u201cshukran.\u201d We were all like toddlers when it came to language, with maybe 20 words among us.I brought them over-the-counter medicines, Band-Aids, a thermometer and lunchboxes. My phone was filled with notes: rain coats, flashlight, toilet paper. I scoured my Facebook feed to find others who were helping refugees, kind people who answered my every question. Nawara, an Arabic speaker from Denver, offered me her cellphone number and, despite our time difference, told me to text whenever I needed a translation.Eventually the family received a cellphone, and I started getting messages in Arabic that said \u201cwelcome,\u201d and began to recognize these as invitations to visit. So I did. As Ruwaida and her husband, Khaled, and I spoke into our phones to say the simplest things, their son, Mohammad, and daughter, Zainab, slapped each other with pool noodles in the yard.We often shook our heads, trying to stop the robotic translator voice from communicating some errant interpretation: \u201cI can\u2019t think of the word\u201d becoming \u201cI can\u2019t think of the George.\u201d We learned to be patient.I started dropping by regularly, always arriving with something in my hands, my American fears of showing up unannounced now allayed. I took them to the pool and offered Zainab a long-sleeve pink leotard and tights with the feet cut off that I had bought in a panic when I realized our swimwear would not be culturally appropriate.She held the outfit, uncertain. The spandex material looked so small. But when she emerged from the bathroom (looking like a stretched piece of pink gum), she smiled broadly. I hadn\u2019t realized how malnourished she was, her ribs and hips protruding. I wondered if her parents would allow her to go off like that, not fully covered. But Khaled, in my husband\u2019s swim trunks, gave a big thumbs up, and off we went.When Zainab developed a persistent cough, I consulted the church sponsorship coordinator about how she was looking, what she was eating, and we debated taking her to urgent care. He and I functioned like amicable former spouses, working out the details of the lives we jointly cared about.When the church coordinator called to tell me that Khaled had received an urgent message from a doctor saying he might have internal bleeding, my husband took him to the hospital, where they befriended a family who spoke Arabic and found a lead on a restaurant job.After five hours in the waiting room, with Khaled insisting he felt fine, a doctor finally drew his blood. It wasn\u2019t until weeks later that we learned the call was a clerical error. Khaled asked if this happened a lot here, and I said: \u201cNo. You\u2019re special.\u201d He laughed.It was the first time humor had translated, the first time our communication had been elevated from the transactional.One night, my husband\u2019s cellphone began collecting urgent texts from his mother and sisters as we slept: His father, an Indian immigrant, had become gravely ill during a visit to his home country. We discussed the pros and cons of my husband\u2019s going, and then his phone rang: Things were getting worse. So he went.The next night, I was alone and terrified, giving my daughter a bath, when Khaled texted me. He was wondering why I had not come to visit them in the past two days.I told him everything, filtering my message through Google Translate and then copying the result into a text. I told him I was sad and scared. My mother was dead. My father hadn\u2019t been in my life for years. My father-in-law meant everything to me, and now I might lose him, too. My husband was across the ocean following an ambulance from one hospital to another, thinking, \u201cGo fast,\u201d \u201cBe well\u201d and \u201cPlease.\u201dI knew the poor translation would be hard for him to understand, but I needed to say all of that, even if in the curlicue of Arabic. And somehow he did understand. He sent me prayers, kind words.I said, \u201cThank you,\u201d when I really meant, \u201cI am so grateful to have your family on the other end of this phone.\u201d He said, \u201cThank you too much,\u201d which I took to mean, \u201cWe are so grateful to be here for you.\u201dOne day, I stopped by their house when one of the Arabic-speaking parishioners was visiting. While my friend Nawara had been wonderful in clearing up our miscommunications after the fact, we hadn\u2019t had the luxury of an in-person translator.Ruwaida served cookies as Khaled prepared coffee. The air smelled of cardamom. The parishioner translated information about medical cards and appointments, school lunches and English classes. And then Khaled asked her to translate a message to me.She listened until he had finished. Then she turned my way and said: \u201cWhen we left Syria, we left everyone we loved. We came here with no family. Even if you come to our home with nothing in your hands, we are happy to see you. You are our family now.\u201dTo hear Modern Love: The Podcast, subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the \u2018Ghost Ship\u2019 Was Invisible in Oakland, Until 36 Died", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The charred, roofless shell of the Ghost Ship, the warehouse where 36 people perished on a chilly Friday evening in early December, is clearly visible from the driveway of Oakland firehouse No. 13.Though the warehouse sits less than 200 yards away, the firehouse\u2019s proximity did nothing to help prevent America\u2019s deadliest structural fire in more than a decade. For years before the Dec. 2 fire, the Ghost Ship may just as well have been invisible to the Oakland Fire Department.Raucous parties. Frequent complaints by neighbors. Calls summoning firefighters to put out fires at nearby properties. None of these triggered an inspection of the warehouse by the crew at the firehouse a short block away.A criminal investigation led by the Alameda County district attorney is now underway into the liability of the owner of the property, the master tenant who essentially ran the warehouse, and others. But dozens of interviews and a review of documents show that the fire was a disaster waiting to happen, a deadly mix of a flawed safety inspection system and a shortage of affordable housing that led tenants to live in a building that was never intended to be a residence. Once the fire erupted, people were trapped in a cluttered warehouse with just two exits.The two city agencies responsible for examining the safety of Oakland\u2019s structures, the Building Department and the Fire Department, hadn\u2019t inspected the Ghost Ship in 30 years.The database that fire officials use to track properties in need of inspections is outdated, resulting in a process that is haphazard at best. Beyond a list of buildings mandated by the state, the city of Oakland leaves it up to the Fire Department to determine which commercial buildings should be inspected and how often.But the city\u2019s website, which laid out details of the program, was altered after the fire, deleting a passage that called for mandatory annual inspections of all commercial buildings. The entry was also changed to say that when inspections occur, they should take place \u201capproximately\u201d every two years.Until last spring, the department had had no fire marshal in about three years. The department remains significantly understaffed, with 62 vacancies, despite adequate funding.Though people were living in the warehouse in clear view of neighbors and the authorities, they were living there illegally; the structure was registered with the county as a warehouse, not a residence. Oakland\u2019s housing crisis has spurred people across the city to live in unsafe places.Also illegal were the concert and party, which were never registered with the city. All but one of the people who died in the fire was attending the party on the second floor, a part of the building that was particularly difficult to escape from.Oakland\u2019s fire chief, Teresa Deloach Reed, defended her department in an interview at headquarters this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing what we always did, and up to this point it worked,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now we\u2019ve discovered that maybe what we\u2019ve been doing is not working.\u201dChief Deloach Reed, however, rejected blame for the fire. When pressed, she offered, \u201cPossibly we fell short in regards to this incident.\u201d She also acknowledged that in hindsight, the building should have come under more scrutiny.Chief Deloach Reed said she was aware that the city\u2019s website had been altered to remove mention of mandatory annual inspections and described it as a belated update reflecting a policy change that occurred around two years ago.\u201cThe website was not accurate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had to be changed in order to reflect really what was going on.\u201dThe database that alerts the department about what buildings to inspect was initially compiled around 15 years ago by firefighters who drove around and drew up lists of businesses, the chief said.But in a measure of confusion over the issue, employees and owners of businesses near the Ghost Ship, including a grocery store, a dry cleaner and a fire extinguisher vendor, all said firefighters inspected their facilities annually. They questioned why the Ghost Ship was not inspected, too.Alex Aguilar, the manager at Kick City, a nearby shoe store, said that in the three years he has worked at the business, firefighters had come by for an inspection every year.Chief Deloach Reed said the department was not equipped to inspect all commercial facilities every year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough resources,\u201d she said.But Rebecca Kaplan, a member of the Oakland City Council, said, \u201cThere are multiple positions that are in the budget that have been funded but that are vacant.\u201dAppearing tense but self-assured, the chief said that the 62 positions that had been budgeted but yet not filled as of November remained vacant because the hiring process can take months.The Fire Department is currently drafting its report on the fire, with input from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Alexandria Corneiro, a spokeswoman for the agency\u2019s San Francisco field division. Once completed, the report will be given to the district attorney\u2019s office.A fixture of the neighborhood of Fruitvale, the building that housed the Ghost Ship was first constructed in 1930, according to county records. It sat amid factories, mills and beer gardens established by the neighborhood\u2019s many immigrants. Al Garcia, a longtime resident, recalled that it was part of a milk bottling plant owned by Dairy Rich in the 1950s and 1960s, then served as a warehouse for copper and cast-iron pipes.Chor Nar Siu Ng bought the building in 1988, also acquiring a lot to its south and a building to its north. In the years that followed, the city began fining her for what it called \u201cnuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious\u201d conditions at the lot and the next-door building.From 2005 to 2014, Ms. Ng paid at least $26,570.20 in \u201ccode enforcement\u201d fees to the city for the empty lot.Mr. Ranelletti said that an inspector visited the warehouse lot on Nov. 17 and 18 in response to two complaints, but was \u201cunable to get visual access\u201d to the property. The inspector had scheduled another visit for next month, on Jan. 16.Property records indicate that Ms. Ng owns roughly 10 properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, most of them in Oakland. In an interview, one woman who rented from her for about 20 years, Griselda Ceja, said she complained repeatedly about a space overrun by rats and a faulty electrical system that caused the circuit box to spark regularly. Ms. Ng has not responded to requests for comment.Ms. Ng began renting the warehouse to an artist named Derick Ion Almena in 2013. As the master tenant, he served as a kind of de facto landlord, illegally subleasing the space for events like the party on Dec. 2. A lawyer, Tony Serra, announced in a statement on Monday that he would be representing Mr. Almena, who did not respond to interview requests.The Ghost Ship was one of dozens of warehouses across the city. Since the fire, these have come under heavy scrutiny. Tenants report emergency inspections from landlords and city inspectors.Still, with so many people living in these spaces, Oakland is trying to strike a difficult balance: keeping residents safe without making them homeless. Rents have jumped 70 percent in five years, faster than in any big city in the nation.The Ghost Ship housed musicians, jewelry makers and others. It also grew to include complex vines of electrical cords, and power failures became a frequent problem.Oakland\u2019s scattershot fire inspection system stands in contrast with that of neighboring Berkeley, which inspects \u201calmost everything except single-family residences,\u201d said Steve Riggs, deputy fire marshal in Berkeley. Warehouses are inspected regardless of whether they are empty, he said.On the night of the Oakland fire, Griffin Madden arrived at the Ghost Ship with his best friend from college, David Cline.Mr. Madden had graduated a year before from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied philosophy and Slavic literature and languages. He was also an up-and-coming D.J., known for throwing pop-up parties with his sister Sky.The Ghost Ship party was held without any permit from the city. It was promoted on Facebook as an event featuring artists from a Los Angeles music label called 100% Silk. And the gathering\u2019s secret location was announced at the last minute.After dark, Mr. Madden and Mr. Cline climbed the rickety staircase that led to the Ghost Ship\u2019s second floor.By 11:15 the party was just getting going. The room was cluttered and dark. It smelled of marijuana and cigarettes.The first indication of the fire was a new smell, like a firecracker. A group illuminated the floor with iPhones to look for the source, and saw wisps of smoke coming up through the cracks. About a half-dozen people made their way to the stairs, and told others to as well.But for most it would be too late. In the space of a few minutes, the faint firecracker smell had become a black cloud.In her studio downstairs, Carmen Brito woke up from a nap choking on smoke. She believes she was the first to notice the fire, which came from the back of the lower part of the building \u2014 and by then, she said, flames had already engulfed an entire wall.Ms. Brito ran from the building and dialed 911 at 11:23.Another resident of the warehouse, Nikki Kelber, ran toward Engine No. 13, the fire station a short block away.\u201cI was screaming at the top of my lungs: \u2018Fire! Fire! Fire!\u2019\u201d Ms. Kelber said.Before she arrived at the firehouse, she saw the station\u2019s door rolling open. The Fire Department says the first truck arrived within three minutes of receiving the first 911 call.Upstairs in the dance area, a resident named Aaron Marin saw flames licking up from behind the D.J. booth. Alarmed, he turned to the point of entry \u2014 the wooden staircase \u2014 which was blocked by confused partygoers. Mr. Marin said he yelled for people to head to a kitchen window.\u201cI\u2019m saying: \u2018Kitchen! Kitchen! Kitchen window!\u2019 The whole place goes black,\u201d Mr. Marin said. \u201c I\u2019m still screaming: \u2018Kitchen! Kitchen! Kitchen window!\u2019 as loud as I can. No one can hear. You can\u2019t even hear, that\u2019s how loud the piercing screams were.\u201dThen, he said, the cries went silent.Mr. Marin, gasping, reached the window, he said, hoisted himself out and dropped \u2014 landing on dirt two stories below.Darin White, the deputy chief of the Oakland Fire Department who helped coordinate efforts to put out the fire, said smoke would have overpowered the victims after just a few gulps.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take very long once you\u2019ve inhaled some superheated gas to be overcome,\u201d he said.It was not until 4:36 a.m., about five hours after the fire was detected, that Deputy Chief White declared the fire under control.It would be a week before Mike Madden learned that his son, Griffin, was dead. He called the coroner\u2019s office, which told him that Griffin\u2019s remains had been found.Mr. Madden lays some of the responsibility for the disaster on Mr. Almena and Ms. Ng. But ultimately, he said, he thinks the city should have done more to protect his son and others.\u201cI believe if people had been doing their jobs, this would have never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an accident or a mistake. People weren\u2019t doing their jobs.\u201dCity officials have expressed their sorrow at the loss of life, but Mr. Madden said he had yet to hear from them.But what he really wants to know, he said, is this: \u201cWhat\u2019s being done to stop the next one?\u201dDoris Burke, Susan Beachy and Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

LOUIS\u2b25Vive le RoiTo the Editor:Yet Caldwell overlooks the most shocking fact of all: After Napoleon\u2019s abdication, France restored the Bourbons, the very monarchy it had so famously overthrown. Bizarre as it may seem, the two brothers of the guillotined Louis XVI became kings \u2014 Louis XVIII in 1814 followed by Charles X in 1824. And after Charles X\u2019s abdication, Louis-Philippe, a cousin to Louis XVI, assumed the throne in 1830. His own abdication in 1848 marked the final end of the Bourbon rule which had endured, with one notorious interruption, for over two centuries.Of course, the French, in a subsequent act of regal restoration, elevated Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte \u2014 nephew of Napoleon I \u2014 from president to Emperor Napoleon III in 1852, a reign that lasted until 1871, when France finally rid itself of kings and emperors.

Stottlemyre, 75, was found to have multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, in 2000.The younger Stottlemyre had said Friday that his father was fighting for his life in a hospital.\u201cHe is recovering at God speed and he is looking forward to getting out of the hospital,\u201d Todd Stottlemyre wrote.Stottlemyre pitched for the Yankees from 1964 to 1974, winning 20 or more games in 1965, 1968 and 1969. He was a five-time All-Star and had a career record of 164-139 with a 2.97 E.R.A. in 360 games.After he retired, Stottlemyre served as a pitching coach for the Mets and the Yankees.LaMarcus Aldridge had a season-high 33 points and the host San Antonio Spurs held on to beat the Chicago Bulls, 119-100, on Sunday after nearly blowing a hot start.Kawhi Leonard added 25 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists. Tony Parker had 13 points and 8 assists.Chicago rallied from a 20-point deficit to lead by 3 points midway through the third quarter but could not sustain the push, taking its third straight loss.Dwyane Wade led the Bulls with 24 points, including 10 in the final quarter.Westbrook had 10 assists in the second half, but fell short of becoming the first Thunder player to score at least 40 points in four straight games.Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 26 points.Houston quarterback Tom Savage was not great in his first career start in place of Brock Osweiler.But Savage did not make any major mistakes during the Texans\u2019 12-10 win over the Cincinnati Bengals on Saturday night, allowing Houston to clinch a second straight A.F.C. South title.Savage and the Texans know he will need to improve in the postseason.\u201cI think we can build, and obviously I think it\u2019s a good thing that we protected the ball \u2014 not put the defense in a tough situation,\u201d Savage said.Savage threw for 260 yards last week to help Houston rally for a 21-20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in his first regular-season action since 2014. Osweiler was benched that game after throwing interceptions on consecutive possessions in the second quarter. Coach Bill O\u2019Brien left Osweiler on the bench and stuck with Savage, and early on against the Bengals it looked like a mistake.Savage, in his third season, completed two passes for 13 yards in the first half, and the Texans trailed by 3-0 at halftime. He was much better in the second half, and he finished with 176 passing yards to help Houston win. He completed 18 of 29 passes and has not turned over the ball. Osweiler threw more interceptions (16) than touchdown passes (14) in his 14 starts.\u201cWe went to no-huddle, and he was able to get rid of the ball a little bit quicker,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe no-huddle helped our pace, our rhythm, and it was just a good job by the offensive staff of getting him into a rhythm.\u201dThough the Texans have already secured the division title, next week at Tennessee will be important for Savage to get more experience before the playoffs begin. They are looking for more this year after an embarrassing 30-0 home loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round last January.\u201cThe goal is to win it all, but this is the first step,\u201d the owner, Bob McNair, said.The Texans are looking to pick up that elusive 10th win after going 9-7 in each of O\u2019Brien\u2019s first two seasons. The Titans will be without quarterback Marcus Mariota after he broke his leg in a loss to the Jaguars on Saturday that helped Houston secure its playoff berth.In one sense, normalcy has returned to the Premier League after the craziness of Leicester\u2019s improbable surge to the title last season.The top six on Christmas Day were the teams that many predicted would challenge for the title: Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United.There is nothing normal about Chelsea\u2019s current form, however.After 11 straight wins, Chelsea leads the league by 6 points over Liverpool. Only once \u2014 Arsenal in 2001, with 13 straight wins \u2014 has a top-tier club had a longer winning streak in one season since World War II.With a stingy defense (two goals conceded in the last 11 games), a dynamic midfield marshaled by N\u2019Golo Kante and a forward line led by the league\u2019s top scorer, Diego Costa, there are no apparent weaknesses in Chelsea\u2019s lineup. It is hard to see how Chelsea can be stopped. Costa, who last season appeared more interested in picking fights than scoring goals, has been consistent this season, with 13 goals and 5 assists.Chelsea has three tough away games left \u2014 at Spurs, Liverpool and United \u2014 and is proving adept at eking out 1-0 wins. Four of its last six games have finished with that score line, including the last three.One thing seems certain: There will be no miracle sequel for Leicester, which is languishing in 15th place.Advertisement"}

Blue Jr., the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if, during the regular session, we waste time and do this kind of stuff.\u201dThe fallout from the law, which the General Assembly passed in March, has been impossible to miss. The National Collegiate Athletic Association stripped North Carolina of its right to host seven championship events this academic year. The Atlantic Coast Conference pulled its football championship from Charlotte, and major companies, including PayPal, abandoned or paused plans to expand in the state. Cultural figures like Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr canceled concerts, and the United States Department of Justice brought a civil rights lawsuit, which is still pending.This week, there was a widespread expectation that Wednesday would be the day when lawmakers would find a way to put the controversies in the past.Then a split along the same lines that led to the law in the first place \u2014 a bitter clash between Republican lawmakers and local officials in Charlotte \u2014 emerged when Republicans accused Charlotte leaders of breaking their end of the bargain.Republicans said they had proposed a clean swap: Charlotte would back down from the changes it made to its anti-discrimination ordinance in February, including new protections on the basis of gender identity, and the General Assembly would repeal H.B. 2.But when Charlotte leaders met on Monday, they did not approve an absolute repeal of the ordinance they passed in February. Instead, to the ire of Republicans in state government, they left in certain provisions, including a part of the ordinance that empowered Charlotte\u2019s community relations committee to \u201capprove or disapprove plans to reduce or eliminate discrimination\u201d with respect to familial status, gender expression, gender identity, marital status and sexual orientation. Charlotte officials met in an emergency session on Wednesday, before the legislature convened, to complete the repeal.Charlotte officials insisted they had no intentions of derailing their agreement \u2014 Robert E. Hagemann, the city attorney, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not dumb enough to try to trick them or trap them\u201d \u2014 but the dust-up offered some Republicans a new talking point that they seized with glee.That was all before midmorning. By late afternoon, the debate in Raleigh had shifted away from H.B. 2 and toward a Republican proposal to resolve the impasse: a repeal of the maligned law and the imposition of a \u201csix-month cooling-off period\u201d in which local governments would be barred from approving or amending any \u201cordinance regulating employment practices or regulating public accommodations or access to restrooms, showers or changing facilities.\u201d\u201cThis is the right thing to do for our state,\u201d said Senator Phil Berger, the Republican leader in the Senate, who added that the measure \u201cgives everyone the opportunity to start over.\u201dYet it was time for Democrats and their allies to balk.\u201cAs much as has been stated this is pushing a reset button, it only pushes it halfway,\u201d said Senator Floyd B. McKissick Jr. \u201cThe problem is, after today, we won\u2019t be fully back where we were before H.B. 2 was passed. Before H.B. 2 was passed, any city, any town, any community in this state who wanted to enact an anti-discrimination policy was free to do so.\u201dMr. Berger\u2019s proposal, Mr. McKissick argued on the Senate floor, \u201cdoesn\u2019t get us quite back to where we need to be. It doesn\u2019t put us back on the same standing, on the same solid ground.\u201dChad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, which opposed H.B. 2 and helped to organize the economic backlash to the law, said on Twitter that Mr. Berger\u2019s measure \u201cdoubles-down on discrimination, and makes clear that NC is still closed for business.\u201dRepublicans in the House had spent the day meeting, again and again, in closed-door caucuses.There was some expectation that the Senate would approve the bill with the six-month cooling off plan and send it over to the House for a vote.But the bill never came. The House moved to adjourn. The Senate considered a last-ditch effort to salvage the session after a Democrat complained that Charlotte was \u201cgetting shoved one more time,\u201d and a Republican condemned the city for orchestrating \u201cthe worst political stunt that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dBut eventually senators, too, voted to go home.As the Senate neared its adjournment and lawmakers exchanged holiday greetings, Mr. Berger complained that Democrats had not acted in good faith. His frustration, laced with apparent disgust, rose in his voice.\u201cI cannot believe this,\u201d he said.Democrats said the state had been left in an embarrassing position.\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be the butt of national and international scorn,\u201d said Representative Darren G. Jackson, a Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sitting here in the chamber all day long, and in the end we did nothing.\u201dOutside the viewing galleries, in the place where many liberal protesters had been arrested last week, a crowd again chanted, \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201dIn a news conference, Mr. Cooper, the governor-elect, said Republican legislative leaders \u201cfailed to live up to their promise\u201d to fully repeal the law \u2014 a promise they made to him, he said, as he and his staff hammered out an agreement for repeal over the course of the last week.The toxic fight over H.B. 2, for now, seems destined to leach into 2017.Richard Fausset reported from Raleigh, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Petrified Unity in Terror-Struck Berlin", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 It has been almost a week since a truck plowed through a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring dozens. In the following days, the city, the country \u2014 all of Europe \u2014 were gripped by the Continentwide manhunt for the suspect, Anis Amri, who was shot and killed by the Italian police on Friday.As I try to get ready for the holidays \u2014 to keep things normal \u2014 I find myself anxiously looking for signs of how my fellow Berliners are handling it all. When I wait at the train station, I wonder if the people next to me are scanning the platform. Are they afraid? And with a momentous national election next year, will that fear translate into political panic?I find no change \u2014 which is both a good and a bad thing.Certainly, sadness prevails in Berlin. At Breitscheidplatz, many have left flowers and candles. Some cry. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d said a man who lives nearby. \u201cWe have helped so many. Why do they attack us?\u201dBut there is also calm unity. \u201cNo matter where you\u2019re coming from, we are one, and we are strong,\u201d somebody wrote on a cardboard sign at the site of the attack. At least in Berlin, there are few demands for walls, or bans on Muslim immigrants.It wasn\u2019t a given that calm would prevail. In Germany, 2016 started off with rage. On New Year\u2019s Eve, gangs of young men harassed, abused and robbed hundreds of women at the main station in Cologne. Most of those the police arrested were North African migrants. Anti-immigrant sentiment surged; trust in the government, and in Chancellor Angela Merkel, plummeted. Attacks on shelters for asylum seekers rose.This rage is still there, of course. \u201cWelcome, murderers, to Merkel\u2019s multicultural slaughterhouse,\u201d somebody wrote this week on the Facebook page of Beatrix von Storch, a prominent figure in the far-right Alternative for Germany party.Marcus Pretzell, the head of the party in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, wrote, just an hour after the attack, \u201cThese are Merkel\u2019s dead.\u201dBut the rage seems contained. On Wednesday, the anti-immigrant Ein Prozent (One Percent) initiative demonstrated in front of the Chancellery. Several high-ranking members of the Alternative for Germany participated, but only a few dozen protesters showed up.Police officers gated off a section in front of the building, enclosing the small and freezing crowd in the dark. The protesters were only a few miles from the mourners at Breitscheidplatz, but in a different world. Here we are, I thought, the angry and the sad, confined in their respective corners of the public sphere.One reason for Germany\u2019s fairly calm response is that we were prepared. New York, London, Madrid, Paris, Brussels \u2014 we all knew something similar would happen to us someday. We had time to watch, and learn. How to mourn, how to not overreact.Over the years, the Western world has developed a set of rituals in response: The lighting of candles, the pilgrimage to the sites of the attack, the defensive occupation of public spaces, the public oath by our representatives to not succumb to fear, the public profession to our liberal values.On Tuesday the Brandenburg Gate was bathed in lights the colors of the German flag. The posting of hashtags of solicitousness is the prayer of our secular times. Even the far-right expressions of wrath, the call for an eye for an eye, are part of the ritual. The populists\u2019 exploitation of the anguish over terrorism has become part of the Western post-attack script.Of course, while rituals are comforting, they risk losing their meaning through repetition. We do not succumb to fear, but as we repeat it, we risk ending up holding the empty shells of former truths.The same is true for the political post-attack ritual of promising harsher security measures. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same after something happened,\u201d said a man at the Chancellery protest. \u201cThey keep promising change and doing nothing.\u201dHe\u2019s not exactly right: In recent years, Germany has introduced significant changes to its asylum laws, as well as to its security apparatus. But his sentiment is widely held on both the left and right. And the number of measures that could be imposed without changing the constitutional character of our country is narrowing. Which means: The frustration of those demanding a strong state response is bound to persist.For now, Germany remains in balance. But we end a crazy year huddled in the cold comfort of petrified division, united in helplessness.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk.The F.B.I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the government\u2019s best-protected networks.Yared Tamene, the tech-support contractor at the D.N.C. who fielded the call, was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for \u201cthe Dukes\u201d and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks \u2014 in part because he wasn\u2019t certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.\u201cI had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo, obtained by The New York Times, that detailed his contact with the F.B.I.It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and information-warfare campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.Like another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee\u2019s old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.An examination by The Times of the Russian operation \u2014 based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack, intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response \u2014 reveals a series of missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack.The D.N.C.\u2019s fumbling encounter with the F.B.I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House\u2019s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.The low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, whose private email account was hacked months later.By last summer, Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day \u2014 procured by Russian intelligence agents, posted on WikiLeaks and other websites, then eagerly reported on by the American media, including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail.In recent days, a skeptical president-elect, the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election.Many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election, while conceding that other factors \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weaknesses as a candidate; her private email server; the public statements of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about her handling of classified information \u2014 were also important.While there\u2019s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A low-cost, high-impact weapon that Russia had test-fired in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States, with devastating effectiveness. For Russia, with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of all-out war, cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap, hard to see coming, hard to trace.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d\u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201dThe United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201dMr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn.\u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed.\u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201dSitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture.Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again.There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have.\u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said.The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show.\u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201dPart of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201dMr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised.Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.\u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d\u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201dThe F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201dBy March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn.A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button.With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C.The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated.One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead.Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world.But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it.The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia.But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.\u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201dSo the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld.Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call.With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers.\u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d\u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201dMr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them.\u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201dThe work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer.It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.\u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email.Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak.All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201dThe D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.\u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201dIt was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201dBut online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.\u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201dThat gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201dThat was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d\u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201dThe Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d\u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201dBut asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201dThough Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web.\u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201dInside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea.In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim.But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president.\u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.\u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201dEven something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky.\u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201dInstead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.\u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201dBut Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters.But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role.But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201dLater, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.\u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded.Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201dA covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201dThe Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive.Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump?In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals.One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper. Its title: \u201cWhy American Elections Are Flawed.\u201dEditors\u2019 Note: An earlier version of the main photograph with this article, of a filing cabinet and computer at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, should not have been published.

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Responsible When Extremists Get a Platform?", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIf these discussions were about litigating the past, their operating definition of what a platform is and does seemed to be stuck in the past as well. In computing, the word carries a different meaning. A platform is a system that enables other systems: A machine provides a platform for software; the software provides a platform for other software; that software might provide a platform for yet more software; and so on. The iPhone platform lets outside parties build and market apps like Uber; the Uber platform lets outside parties sign up to drive other Uber users for money.Somewhere between media and social media \u2014 between familiar ideas about politics and the news and the ones that underpin the world we live in today \u2014 platforms changed from responsibilities into abdications of responsibility. Claiming to provide a platform, in Silicon Valley, doesn\u2019t demand defense. It is the defense. Platforms don\u2019t cause problems; people do.The closest thing the new world of platforms has to a foundational text is a business book called \u201cInvisible Engines,\u201d published in 2006, which examined and tried to define a nascent form of business: one that doesn\u2019t just sell a good or service, but instead creates value by spawning entire ecosystems and economies. Nintendo and Sega, for example, allowed game developers to create and sell games that ran on their machines; smartphones let software companies connect with customers through app stores; eBay connects merchants and sellers, creating transactions but selling nothing itself. The book makes the prescient case that platforms will come to redefine our economy.\u201cThe platform\u2019s value is not necessarily what it does,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and one of the book\u2019s authors, \u201cbut what it enables.\u201d And what it enables can be enormous. It would be difficult to overstate the zeal that exists for platform companies in Silicon Valley. They represent staggering opportunities, the chance to create or remake entire industries and to preside over them indefinitely, with maximum control and minimum participation or liability. Airbnb has created a marketplace that overlaps substantially with the hotel business, but the properties it rents to users are owned by other users. (The company recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging a New York law that could result in fines against Airbnb for illegally listed properties; it agreed to drop the suit on the condition that fines be levied only against people listing property, not the company itself.) Uber created a sort of marketplace for transportation but doesn\u2019t own its vehicles nor \u2014 it claims, over and over, in courts all across the globe \u2014 does it employ its drivers.But the platform economies that are most developed and that have captured the most people \u2014 the ones that transact on attention, advertising and communication \u2014 are not immediately recognizable to their users as marketplaces. Facebook is not primarily understood among its billion and a half users as an attention brokerage, but that\u2019s exactly what it is: a middleman between users and other users; between advertisers and users; between developers and users; between publishers and advertisers and their viewers and readers.Participants successfully contribute to the broader marketplace by inducing other participants to engage more; beyond shares and followers, success is rewarded off-platform, with the conversion of attention into relationships, into advertising on websites, into sales or into influence and political power. Social platforms are the most extreme and advanced expression of what may be the defining corporate strategy of our time.And so it\u2019s valuable to listen to how they talk about themselves. In a comment under his post about the election, Zuckerberg reiterated, with force, what he sees as the nature of Facebook. \u201cI find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\u201d he wrote, explaining that the company also works on aerospace technology and business software. It\u2019s a platform that aspires to \u201cconnect the world\u201d but that must not be credited with changing it in the process.This line of thinking could not feel more distant from some of the alarming experiences social-media platforms foster. Reddit users terrorized by the openly bigoted and aggressive communities that have congregated there are not comforted by an appeal to economic principles. The virtues of an open platform are lost on the victim of a spontaneous Twitter mob, inspired anonymously or, as the case may be, by the president-elect of the United States. Understanding that the widespread belief in disinformation may have been an unforeseen externality of Facebook\u2019s design is more interesting than helpful, especially as Facebook says it will look to the wisdom of the crowd for solutions to its problems.In seeking and depending on minimum liability, platforms leave gaping voids. For an example of how such a void can be filled, and exploited, look no further than the Breitbart of the 2016 election. It is a site that frequently flaunts its success on social-media platforms and appears amenable to the prevailing winds of change. \u201cBreitbart Ranked #1 for Most Shared Facebook Content on Presidential Debate Day,\u201d read one headline. \u201cMedia Firms Lose Control of News as Tech Platforms Rise,\u201d read another from June. Another story from August begins, \u201cBreitbart News has jumped to the 11th biggest presence on Facebook in terms of total engagements for the month of July,\u201d a ranking of likes, shares and comments that placed the site between The Times and The Washington Post.The site is also keenly aware of its dependence on social media, so attempts made by these platforms to regulate participants or to ban or discourage hateful behavior are covered by Breitbart as conspiracies or assaults on freedom. The site wrote aggressively about frail allegations that Facebook had censored conservative content in its trending-topic module. (Facebook subsequently fired the team responsible for moderating it.) It describes attempts at Twitter moderation as censorship and has characterized the company\u2019s recent account bans as a \u201cpurge.\u201dMany media companies mistakenly imagine Facebook is some sort of partner \u2014 a larger entity that exists on the same spectrum. But Breitbart behaves as though it knows this isn\u2019t true. In practice, it has embraced its role as a platform citizen, one more subservient content peddler among many. In this sense, Breitbart couldn\u2019t have been the platform for the alt-right online. That title would belong to Reddit, to Twitter, to Facebook or to Google, if ever they wanted to claim it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tennis Star Petra Kvitova Badly Injured in Home Invasion", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byPetra Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon singles champion, was attacked by a man with a knife on Tuesday morning in her apartment in Prostejov, Czech Republic, sustaining severe injuries to her left hand.The attack was vicious; Kvitova\u2019s agents confirmed an account of the struggle, first reported by the BBC, in which an unknown assailant entered her apartment to rob it under the guise of checking a utility meter. A struggle in a bathroom led to a knife being placed against Kvitova\u2019s throat. She was able to fight free, but not before sustaining deep cuts to the fingers of her left hand.Her assailant, described by the Prostejov police as a man in his mid-30s, was still at large.Karel Tejkal, a spokesman for the Czech Fed Cup team, characterized the attack as \u201ca random criminal act.\u201d\u201cThe end of her career did not even cross her mind,\u201d Tejkal said in an interview on Czech television. \u201cShe kept saying, \u2018Let them put me together fast, no matter if it takes months or years.\u2019 She is looking forward to training again.\u201dDamage to her left hand could affect her future in tennis: Kvitova plays left-handed and uses a two-handed backhand. She was transported to a hospital in Brno, the country\u2019s second-largest city, roughly 40 miles away, where Kvitova had been scheduled to appear at a children\u2019s charity event Tuesday. After 3 hours 45 minutes, doctors had repaired tendons in all five digits of her left hand as well as two nerves, Kvitova\u2019s spokeswoman, Katie Spellman, said in a statement.\u201cConsidering the extent of the damage, the surgery went very well,\u201d Spellman said.Kvitova will wear a cast for six to eight weeks, and will be unable to bear weight for three months. A timetable for a possible return to the sport is not yet known.Dr. Michael W. Kessler, the chief of hand and elbow surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, said the numbness after sustaining nerve injuries could prove particularly disruptive to playing tennis again.\u201cHitting a forehand or a backhand is really challenging with tendon injuries, but we also always talk about touch in tennis, to hit a drop shot or something like that,\u201d said Kessler, who did not know the specifics of Kvitova\u2019s injury. \u201cA tennis racket is the extension of someone\u2019s arm, so not having the feedback from the fingertips to the same level of specificity that was there before can also be challenging.\u201dKvitova had been scheduled to begin her 2017 season at the Hopman Cup in Perth, Australia, but pulled out earlier Tuesday with an existing stress fracture in her right foot. The Australian Open, the year\u2019s first Grand Slam event, begins on Jan. 16.After falling out of the top 10 this year, Kvitova surged in the second half of the year, winning a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, WTA titles in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Zhuhai, and a fifth Fed Cup title with her Czech teammates in November. She finished the year ranked 11th. Last week, she won the WTA\u2019s sportsmanship award for the fifth time in six years.Elite women\u2019s tennis players have been violently attacked before, often with career-altering results. In 1993, top-ranked Monica Seles was stabbed during a match in Hamburg, Germany, and did not return to the sport for more than two years. When she did, her dominance subsided and she added only one Grand Slam singles title to her previous eight.Chakvetadze said Tuesday that she was \u201cvery upset\u201d when she heard that Kvitova had been attacked, emphasizing that mental recovery from such an attack can be more difficult than the physical aspects.\u201cEspecially when you got badly injured, you always ask yourself, \u2018Why did it happen?\u2019\u201d Chakvetadze said. \u201cCould I do something different in that situation? I got an arm nerve injury after they tied it up with TV cable, and it took one month to feel my arm again. With a knife, it\u2019s even worse. I hope she will recover as soon as possible, mentally and physically, but it would not be easy.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting from Prague.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rex Tillerson, Exxon C.E.O., Chosen as Secretary of State", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump on Tuesday officially selected Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, to be his secretary of state. In saying he will nominate Mr. Tillerson, the president-elect is dismissing bipartisan concerns that the globe-trotting leader of an energy giant has a too-cozy relationship with Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia.A statement from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition office early Tuesday brought to an end his public and chaotic deliberations over the nation\u2019s top diplomat \u2014 a process that at times veered from rewarding Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of his most loyal supporters, to musing about whether Mitt Romney, one of his most outspoken critics, might be forgiven.Instead, Mr. Trump has decided to risk what looks to be a bruising confirmation fight in the Senate.In the past several days, Republican and Democratic lawmakers had warned that Mr. Tillerson would face intense scrutiny over his two-decade relationship with Russia, which awarded him its Order of Friendship in 2013, and with Mr. Putin.The hearings will also put a focus on Exxon Mobil\u2019s business dealings with Moscow. The company has billions of dollars in oil contracts that can go forward only if the United States lifts sanctions against Russia, and Mr. Tillerson\u2019s stake in Russia\u2019s energy industry could create a very blurry line between his interests as an oilman and his role as America\u2019s leading diplomat.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Tillerson has been publicly skeptical about the sanctions, which have halted some of Exxon Mobil\u2019s biggest projects in Russia, including an agreement with the state oil company to explore and pump in Siberia that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on Saturday that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s connections to Mr. Putin were \u201ca matter of concern to me\u201d and promised to examine them closely if he were nominated.\u201cVladimir Putin is a thug, bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying,\u201d Mr. McCain said on Fox News.Mr. Romney, Mr. Petraeus and Mr. Corker, the three leading runners-up, all received calls late Monday informing them of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, according to people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s final choice.He settled on Mr. Tillerson, a deal maker who has spent the past four decades at Exxon, much of it in search of oil and gas agreements in troubled parts of the world. A native of Wichita Falls, Tex., who speaks with a strong Texas twang, Mr. Tillerson, 64, runs a company with operations in about 50 countries, and has cut deals to expand business in Venezuela, Qatar, Kurdistan and elsewhere.If confirmed as secretary of state, Mr. Tillerson would face a new challenge: nurturing alliances around the world that are built less on deals and more on diplomacy.That could prove to be a special test when it comes to Russia, where Mr. Tillerson has fought for years to strengthen connections through business negotiations worth billions of dollars. Under his leadership, Exxon has entered into joint ventures with Rosneft, a Russian-backed oil company, and donated to the country\u2019s health and social programs.In his new role, Mr. Tillerson would have to manage the difficult relationship between the United States and Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, including the economic sanctions imposed after Moscow intervened in Ukraine and occupied Crimea. Last month, President Obama and European leaders agreed to keep sanctions in place until Mr. Putin agrees to a cease-fire and to the withdrawal of heavy weapons from front lines in eastern Ukraine.Other Republicans who have challenged Mr. Tillerson\u2019s potential selection include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who expressed concern in a Twitter post on Monday about his relationship with Mr. Putin.That led to interest in Mr. Romney, who had called Mr. Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony\u201d during the campaign. Mr. Romney had also highlighted Russia as a danger to United States interests during the 2012 race.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, argued strongly for Mr. Tillerson, and the president-elect was intrigued.Mr. Trump met with Mr. Tillerson for more than two hours on Saturday at Trump Tower in Manhattan. To his aides, Mr. Trump described Mr. Tillerson as in a different \u201cleague\u201d than his other options.\u201cMy discussions with President-elect Trump have been both enjoyable and enlightening,\u201d Mr. Romney wrote.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Year\u2019s Game Changers in Space", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byTurning PointsThere were many forces dividing us in 2016, nation from nation, faction from faction, person from person. But there is a countervailing force that can draw us together: the quest to answer fundamental questions that have captivated humans since ancient times.At the forefront of this quest are scientists \u2014 the true explorers of our era. Every year, they map a little more of the unknown, claim a little more of what seemed impenetrable. In 2016, they made three significant breakthroughs in understanding the universe and our place in it.In the last few years, NASA\u2019s Kepler space observatory and other missions have sparked a revolution in astronomy, arguably as fundamental as the Copernican revolution that spun us from our imagined perch at the center of everything. So far they have identified nearly 5,000 potential planets beyond the solar system, 21 of which are rocky planets that might be habitable. These numbers imply that there could be billions of such planets in our galaxy alone. \u201cHome\u201d no longer necessarily means Earth alone.In August, the European Southern Observatory announced that astronomers taking part in the Pale Red Dot campaign had confirmed the existence of an Earth-like planet in the nearest star system to us.The Alpha Centauri system contains three stars: Two sunlike stars, orbiting each other, and a red dwarf called Proxima Centauri. The planet, probably somewhat larger than our own, was found orbiting this smaller, third sun. Its orbit lies within the star\u2019s \u201chabitable zone,\u201d neither too hot nor too cold, where water may be found in liquid form.Finding this planet, Proxima b, was a game-changer. It\u2019s our next-door neighbor, in cosmic terms. Astronomers plan to study its composition and features to determine whether it has water or an atmosphere. While we know that Proxima b is in the habitable zone, we don\u2019t yet know if it\u2019s truly habitable \u2014 or even inhabited.This discovery came at a serendipitous moment for me, just four months after the physicist Stephen Hawking and I, with the support of Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, began a new space initiative called Breakthrough Starshot. It\u2019s a research and engineering program attempting to design, build and launch multiple \u201cnanocraft\u201d \u2014 tiny, laser-powered probes \u2014 that could reach the Alpha Centauri system within a generation. Rather than building one huge vessel, which would take tens of thousands of years to get there, we\u2019re hoping to launch many tiny probes, each no bigger than a computer chip, and with a sail attached. Powerful lasers acting on those sails will, in principle, push the nanocraft to speeds reaching 20 percent of the speed of light \u2014 more than 100 million miles an hour.Now, with the discovery of Proxima b, Starshot has its first target. What might we find there?This year\u2019s second breakthrough may give us a hint. In July a team of evolutionary biologists led by Bill Martin at Heinrich Heine University in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, reconstructed the genetic makeup of \u201cLuca\u201d \u2014 the Last Universal Common Ancestor. This was the single-celled organism that became the mother of all life on Earth today.During the reconstruction, the biologists pored over millions of genes from thousands of species of microbes, isolating the 355 most ancient ones \u2014 those that were probably present in Luca. But these genes did more than pinpoint ancestry; they sketched a portrait of the organism itself, showing us a creature that lived an extreme life. It metabolized hydrogen, not oxygen, and clung to the walls of deep-sea volcanic vents.Microbes sharing a high proportion of those 355 genes are still found in such vents today. And that\u2019s exactly the environment where some theorists have placed the origin of life itself. The discovery hints that life may have begun in nonliving \u201ccells\u201d that were naturally formed in the volcanic rock; and that the basic processes of energy conversion, which continue today in every one of our cells, were underway there before the first organic cell ever evolved.The Luca analysis provides evolutionary biologists with hard data about life at a specific point in its early progress. They can use it to look forward in time, asking when and how this organism branched into multicellular microbes and eventually complex organisms. And they can look backward, asking how life might have slowly dawned in the watery rock that became our vital Earth.We do not yet know the conditions on Proxima b. It may have a relatively gentle climate, like Earth\u2019s today. Or it may be \u201ctidally locked,\u201d with one hemisphere permanently roasting in the glare of its sun, the other frozen, facing empty space. But if life can emerge in the conditions of hydrothermal vents, it cannot be ruled out even on a world of such extremes.Starshot\u2019s nanocraft could have instruments that measure potential signatures of life. If the technology works, it will take them about 20 years to cross the 25 trillion miles to Proxima b and more than four years for the photos and measurements they take to be beamed back to Earth.Beyond Proxima b, our broader goal with Starshot is to foster a unifying, planetary quest for exploration and knowledge: to take our first steps \u2014 as a species and a planet \u2014 into the galaxy.A few months before the announcement of Breakthrough Starshot, physicists from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in the United States told the world that after years of waiting, they had heard a \u201cchirp\u201d \u2014 a brief signal indicating the detection of gravitational waves in space. The waves were churned up by the collision of two black holes over a billion years ago.That chirp confirmed the predictions of Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which tells us that space and time are not separate dimensions, but are bound together as a four-dimensional \u201cspace-time.\u201d This space-time is not a static background, but dynamic: It is warped by the presence of massive bodies. And Einstein\u2019s theory predicted that it can also flow.This means that the gravitational waves the observatory detected were not waves of fluid, energy or any known substance. They were waves in space-time. If everything we see in the universe were the brush strokes of a painting, a gravitational wave would be a quiver in the canvas itself.That chirp also inaugurated the field of gravitational wave astronomy: the use of these waves as an observational tool, advancing our power to explore further. It has been said that the discovery opens a new window on the universe, but a new window would reveal only a different view. This is more like the evolution of an entirely new sense organ. It will enable astronomers to discern immensely violent events that were previously invisible to us, such as collisions between the supermassive black holes that lurk at the center of most galaxies. And it may offer a glimpse of the universe as it was just after the big bang.Our curiosity about all that we\u2019ve discovered this year will fuel more breakthroughs, and that curiosity is felt not only by the scientists at the vanguard of exploration, but by all of humanity. Confronting the fundamental questions is the greatest adventure there is, and all of us \u2014 no matter where we live or what we do \u2014 can be invested in it.Yuri Milner, a technology investor and science philanthropist, was a co-founder of the investment firm DST Global.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "John Morris may be an avowed pacifist, but his career has been largely defined by war. He was born during WWl, was Robert Capa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo editor at Life magazine during WWll and was the first to put graphic photos of the Vietnam War on the New York Times front page. He is widely considered to be one of the most important editors in the history of photography.Perhaps the oldest living one at that: He will celebrate his 100th birthday on Wednesday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLiving past 100 has become more and more popular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in jest during a phone interview from his home in Paris.Mr. Morris plans to celebrate his birthday there and share his cake with a couple of hundred friends that he has accumulated during his 40-plus years of editing at Life magazine, Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, Magnum, The Washington Post and The New York Times, as well as during his decades of retirement.On his 25th birthday, which fell on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Mr. Morris, then a correspondent for Life magazine in Los Angeles, was at home tossing a football with a friend as his wife, Mary, baked a birthday cake. Around noon, he received a call from his editors telling him that Pearl Harbor had been attacked earlier that day. He rushed downtown to the Little Tokyo neighborhood and ended his day at 3 a.m. at the F.B.I. headquarters, where Japanese-Americans on an agency watch list were being rounded up. Mr. Morris missed his birthday party and the cake, but the attack on Pearl Harbor changed his life.The next year, he became the London picture editor in charge of Life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographic coverage of the war in Europe. While there, he edited Robert Capa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic photos of the D-Day landing at Normandy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Omaha Beach in 1944.To better understand the photos he was editing, he created the job title of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoordinator of photographers on the western front,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which allowed him to walk ashore in Normandy in July 1944 and accompany individual photographers from The Associated Press and Life for a month.After serving as the top photo editor at Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, Magnum and The Washington Post, Mr. Morris started as the picture editor at The New York Times on Memorial Day weekend in 1967. In those days, photos were used sparingly and were rarely more than an afterthought on the front page.The Vietnam War was raging and Mr. Morris fought hard to place truthful photos of the war in the paper. He insisted that Eddie Adams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Saigon execution photo run at the top of the front page and later convinced masthead editors to place Nick Ut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo of the naked girl running from a napalm bomb at the bottom of the page despite a Times policy against nudity. Both images won Pulitzer Prizes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have always believed in showing how ugly war is, and I have encouraged newspapers to take a realistic view of war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Morris has been married and widowed three times. He is spry and lectures widely, traveling with his companion of the last six years, Patricia Trocm\u00c3\u00a9. Recently, he has been pondering what role photography will have in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpost-truth\u00e2\u0080\u009d era, a topic of discussion with the war photographer David Douglas Duncan, who turned 100 earlier this year.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they no longer think truth is important, that\u2019s the end of journalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Morris said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very serious situation. I hope for the best but am fearing the worst.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Morris has spent the last year reflecting on his life while piecing together his experiences into a narrative for the book.In 1944, when he first looked at the film that Mr. Capa shipped from Omaha Beach, there were only 11 frames that had images. The rest of the 35mm rolls had no images despite a note from Mr. Capa indicating that the best photos were on those four rolls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not on the medium-format film that had images taken before the landing.For 70 years, Mr. Morris has said a lab technician had told him that the four rolls accidentally melted in the drying process and only part of one roll survived. The story that some of the most important photos in history were destroyed became part of photojournalism lore.But questions about that story have been raised in the last year amid claims that it was unlikely the negatives melted and that the surviving film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance did not seem to conform to the account of enduring unusual heat.After studying new theories of what happened, Mr. Morris now thinks that the negatives were not melted, and that Mr. Capa only exposed 11 frames on one of the four rolls that were shipped. Mr. Capa probably was rattled, Mr. Morris said, during the withering fire he withstood at Omaha beach.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he himself knew how many pictures he had shot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Morris said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there were three rolls that had nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank God we had one roll that had something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Despite the powerful war photos that Mr. Morris edited and placed in publications, there has been no shortage of conflict. When asked what he learned during his century, he paused and then offered a blunt assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMankind is not as bright as one would hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be so simple in my judgment to stop war. You just have to say that war is no longer a good business. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what keeps America at war. War is our biggest business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "They Left for a Better Life. It Got Tragically Worse.", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Pete Ambrose and Danielle McGuire put Maine behind them to start anew in New York. They wound up in an apartment for the homeless, where their daughters were scalded by radiator steam.Supported byHOULTON, Me. \u2014 It is a long drive from nowhere, the last stop in America before Interstate 95 hits the Canadian border, a shrinking rural town long past its heyday, where drug overdoses and poverty intrude on the northern landscape of forests and potato fields.The couple had had their problems in Houlton. Friends said that drugs were a constant temptation in their circle. Both had arrest records. Mr. Ambrose had fathered at least four children before marrying Ms. McGuire, friends and relatives said, and in 2011 one of the women who bore two of his children got an order of protection against him.But the birth of their first child \u2014 a girl they named Ibanez, after Ms. McGuire\u2019s favorite brand of electric guitar \u2014 and the impending arrival of their second had the couple imagining a different life.\u201cThey just wanted a fresh, clean slate, to start over with their family,\u201d said Skylar Case, 25, a close friend of Ms. McGuire\u2019s. They wanted to live in a place \u201cwhere you could walk down the street with tattoos and your guitar and fit in.\u201dThat place was New York.On July 9, 2015, the small family showed up at the city\u2019s homeless intake center in the Bronx. They quickly learned to work the system, reapplying multiple times for shelter before finally settling in a city-paid apartment for the homeless on Hunts Point Avenue in the Bronx on Nov. 1.Pictures and videos posted online show enthusiastic parents with happy children. There are pictures that show a young couple in love, hugging, kissing, mugging for the camera. Neighbors nicknamed the two ebullient toddlers, Ibanez and her baby sister, Scylee Vayoh, \u201cthe Disney kids.\u201dYet there was constant anxiety about money, and struggles to find work. Ms. McGuire took Scylee with her when she played her guitar for tips in the subway at Grand Central Terminal, once drawing the attention of child welfare authorities. On another occasion, the police and child welfare investigators arrived at the apartment after the couple got into a loud argument.Fifteen minutes later, the girls were declared dead.It was a horrific story that focused attention on the bizarre cause, the tragic outcome and the somewhat unusual route the family took to establish a home in Hunts Point, where the city maintained a so-called cluster site: several apartments reserved for the homeless in a private building. Apartments like the one the Ambrose family stayed in are meant to be a temporary form of shelter, but the family stayed there more than 13 months.Houlton, a town of about 6,000 residents, is the seat of Aroostook County, known as the Crown of Maine, but it is one of the poorest in the state, where one in six people live in poverty. The county has the state\u2019s lowest median household income, just $36,066, slightly higher than the Bronx, although with a more affordable cost of living.Crystal meth and opioid use, as in so many small towns, was rampant. Through the end of September, 12 people had died this year from drug overdoses in Aroostook County; statewide 286 people had died from overdoses through that date, already surpassing the 272 overdose deaths in all of 2015, according to the Maine attorney general\u2019s office.Ms. McGuire\u2019s father, Wade McGuire, 53, grew up in a farmhouse, the family so destitute that he recalls snow falling through a hole in the roof. Now he lives in a modest rented house on Spring Street, full of pictures of Jesus and of his granddaughters, with an ashtray on every table. The family, Mr. McGuire said, has been plagued by tragedy: He recited a catalog of family members and others close to him who had died young. And now Ibanez and Scylee.His daughter, Danielle, 24, split her childhood between the homes of her parents, who never married. She went to the local high school and then transferred to a small private school, the Carlton Project.\u201cShe always had an outgoing \u2018not caring what people think\u2019 personality,\u201d said Ms. Case, Ms. McGuire\u2019s friend. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t scared to be different. Around here everyone tries to be the same.\u201dShe loved music, playing guitar and singing, a talent she got from her father. People said she had the voice of an angel.Mr. Ambrose, 35, is part Maliseet Indian. He bounced around a lot, living for a time on land occupied by the tribe outside town or in a trailer park nearby, or with his mother in Bangor. He made money giving people tattoos and he played guitar. He liked heavy metal music, grew dreadlocks and called himself Pete Death. He had run-ins with the law and, by his own account, struggled with addiction.Ms. McGuire kept her plans to leave secret from her father, and on the day she left Houlton, she left him a note: They had gone to start a new life. She and Ibanez boarded a bus to join her husband, who had gone ahead.In Maine, the couple had always had places to stay, most recently at Ms. McGuire\u2019s father\u2019s house. But in New York, they were alone and without much money, and they appear to have gone directly to the city\u2019s intake center for homeless families in the Bronx.They were among the 13 percent of homeless people who list their last known address as being outside New York (though many of those \u2014 all but 3 percent \u2014 had lived in the city before), turning up in or returning to a city that is obligated by court order to give shelter to anyone who asks.Mr. Ambrose already knew how the system worked: He had stayed in a New York City homeless shelter for single men from August to November 2012.Families are typically allowed to stay in shelters for up to 10 days while employees of the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services investigate their cases.When the 10 days were up for the Ambrose family, they were rejected. But as many families do, they simply reapplied and were given another 10 days of shelter. When they were rejected a second time, they applied again, according to a city official familiar with their case. This happened repeatedly for months: In all, the couple applied for shelter 10 times.Residents there remembered the couple, with Ibanez in tow, busking in front of a McDonald\u2019s on Roosevelt Avenue.Then, in October, the couple\u2019s second child was born a month prematurely. In a social media post, and later in video that appeared on YouTube, Ms. McGuire said that the baby needed heart surgery.Finally, on Oct. 31, the couple got the news they had been waiting for: A caseworker had finally spoken by phone to a relative of theirs in Maine, who corroborated their claim that they did not have a home to go back to, according to the city official. With that, the Department of Homeless Services determined they were eligible to occupy a city-paid apartment for the homeless on Hunts Point Avenue in the Bronx. They moved in the next day.\u201cthe neighbor hood is riddled with automatic gunfire everyweekend....no joke...,\u201d he wrote. The police, he said, \u201cwont come to hunts point...I just saw a guy smash the teeth out of this other guy with a pistol, then fire 3 shots in the air.....no cop cars no nothing.....super loud rap music u can hear in your livingroom from across the street till 2 or 3 am.....I bought a guitar amp to hook to my computer for volume boost....Id LITTERALLY give my right arm to be back on tunk lake, painting houses.....I just don\u2019t know how to find my way home bud....we r completely and utterly misseable...no friends no neghbors that have any common intrests and the LITTERALLY only white/Native couple In all of Hunts point......this Is what we could afford and even this Is sinking our ship...S.O.S.!\u201dLater he wrote: \u201cHunts Point Bronx=There Is no GOd.\u201dAt one point over the summer, he wrote to his mother on Facebook and told her that the couple were planning to leave New York in January, suggesting in another post that they might try their luck in Italy, \u201cif all goes well.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get no cash assistance or food stamps from the state,\u201d Ms. McGuire says in the video. \u201cChild Protective Services called. They said I was endangering the welfare of my daughter, which I disagree. Because I\u2019m playing guitar with her, like I said, in the heated subway. She\u2019s always taken care of.\u201dMs. Case said that Ms. McGuire told her that she loved busking in Grand Central because of the sheer numbers of passers-by \u2014 in an hour there she could play before more people than she might have played for back home in a lifetime.Mr. Ambrose said that he and his wife were awakened at about 6 a.m. when a valve popped off the radiator in the living room, where they slept. They replaced it, he said, but did not check on the girls. Ms. McGuire later went out to run errands, her husband said, and he fell back asleep \u2014 apparently never realizing that the radiator in the adjoining room where the girls slept had also malfunctioned.At about 11:45 a.m. Ms. McGuire returned to the apartment and soon went into the girls\u2019 room to find them turning purple and blistering from the intense heat and scalding steam.Anne Martinez, 47, a neighbor, recalled seeing the father carrying Ibanez, and the mother trying to give CPR to a motionless Scylee on the floor of the building\u2019s lobby.\u201cAll you could see in that apartment was all that steam coming out,\u201d Ms. Martinez said. The steam was so thick, she said, \u201cit looked like a fire.\u201dPolice and city officials are investigating the episode but have yet to provide a detailed explanation of what occurred, other than to say that a valve came off the radiator in the girls\u2019 room, allowing steam to escape.The couple visited the apartment once more and gave away the girls\u2019 clothes and toys to Ms. Martinez.\u201cNot ok,\u201d Mr. Ambrose replied, adding that they were \u201cdestroyed as ppl as parents as a married couple dead babies make dead parents I found.\u201dTo his mother he wrote: \u201cin a second the world becomes an uncertain lonley desperate place where you cant be anymore...i have to find my baby girls. They need there daddy and i cant find them.\u201dBack in Houlton, Danielle\u2019s father said that he bursts into tears when he thinks about what happened to his granddaughters.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they would be homeless when they could be with me,\u201d Mr. McGuire said. \u201cExcuse my language, I don\u2019t know why in the hell she went down there. She could have stayed up here, she could have stayed right here with me and everything would\u2019ve been fine. Those kids would still be with us.\u201dNikita Stewart contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Ushkowitz starred in the television show \u201cGlee\u201d and has appeared in Broadway musicals, including \u201cWaitress\u201d and \u201cSpring Awakening.\u201d Mr. Iglehart won a Tony Award in 2014 for his role as the Genie in \u201cAladdin.\u201dThe video shows Mr. de Blasio, who is running for re-election in the coming year, sitting in the back of what appears to be one of the mayoral sport utility vehicles, talking with Ms. McCray on his cellphone.\u201cHey honey, I really like this song idea,\u201d he says. \u201cI really think it\u2019s the perfect way to wrap up all the great things we\u2019ve done this year.\u201dMs. McCray, Ms. Hagelgans and the actors are shown in a room at Gracie Mansion.Ms. McCray puts the mayor on speaker phone so he can listen as the two actors sing, accompanied by a piano player.\u201cIn case the folks are unaware, we\u2019ve got some facts we\u2019d like to share,\u201d they sing.They go on to plug mayoral programs like protections for renters, the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and a mental health initiative.\u201cWho\u2019s bringing cops and community close?\u201d Ms. Ushkowitz sings as the beat goes up-tempo. \u201cWho\u2019s got incarceration and crime rates sinking to a record low?\u201dThe performance closes with a rousing reference to Mr. de Blasio. \u201cNo matter what will be, we\u2019ve got Billy D. B.!\u201d Ms. Ushkowitz belts out.The mayor starts out nodding happily to all the praise but then whispers to an aide, \u201cThis is kind of over the top.\u201d In the end, he delivers his review of the performance: \u201cMaybe the song\u2019s a little too elaborate,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we should just do a couple of tweets and a Facebook post instead.\u201dDick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog organization, questioned whether creating the video was a justifiable use of public resources and said it raised questions because it came right before next year\u2019s re-election campaign.\u201cThis is a virtual campaign ad that is meant to be a public-service announcement but goes beyond that in serving to promote the mayor,\u201d Mr. Dadey said.The video is part of a broader effort by City Hall to increase its use of the internet and social media to reach out to New Yorkers directly, bypassing traditional news media. It also comes as Mr. de Blasio controls his interactions with the press, frequently avoiding questions and limiting the news conferences at which he will take questions on any topic to once a week.Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said that the video was produced by City Hall staff and that the actors volunteered their time. Mr. Phillips said that City Hall spent a total of $700 to pay the piano player and a composer. He said it cost an additional $170 to have the piano tuned and $30 to rent a rehearsal room.Although the mayor is running for re-election next year, Mr. Phillips said in a written statement that the video \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with his campaign.\u201d He added, \u201cWe think New Yorkers have a right to know what their government does, and it\u2019s our job to communicate that work in a modern way.\u201dThe immediate effect of the video was not exactly the stuff of Broadway hit material. In the first seven hours after the video was posted on Twitter, it had received 218 likes on the mayor\u2019s account and 88 retweets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Quit Social Media. Put It to Work for Your Career Instead.", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsBut I\u2019m not just here to proclaim the greatness that is social media. I agree with some of the points that Mr. Newport makes about the potential harm it can cause. But I think there are ways to navigate these hurdles rather than hiding from social media altogether.Here\u2019s how I believe we can address some career challenges presented by social media, as outlined by Mr. Newport:\u201cMany people in my generation fear that without a social media presence, they would be invisible to the job market.\u201d This is actually a reasonable belief, and it\u2019s a reality that is becoming more clear each day. Tools are available that enable employers to search all the digital bread crumbs you leave behind to see a fuller picture of who you are and how you might fit within their organization.Most employers and customers I\u2019ve talked to are ultimately looking for confirmation of their excitement about you, not reasons for suspicions or doubts. Not having any profile could be seen as a red flag, so why give a potential employer any reason to question your candidacy?Your social media presence \u2014 and, really, your whole digital footprint \u2014 is no longer just an extension of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It\u2019s as important as your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Social media use is now a standard of the hiring process, and there\u2019s little chance of going back.\u201cCultivating your social media brand is a fundamentally passive approach to professional advancement.\u201d One reason to leave the social world behind is the torrid pace of maintaining a public, digital brand on social media for little return. Mr. Newport\u2019s column tells of a writer who became overwhelmed by his sense of obligation \u201cto update his blog every half-hour or so,\u201d for very little value delivered. But the rabid sharer is just one type of social media user.There are many people with a presence on social media who are what we affectionately call lurkers, those who may never or rarely post or share but who simply consume content widely. These activities may seem passive, but they are not. Lurkers may be doing much to further their careers: learning new things, keeping up with the latest trends or preparing for any conversation that might crop up in the break room or during a job interview.\u201cSocial media use is decidedly not rare or valuable.\u201dIn many cases, social media can have a substantial effect on important issues and on public discourse. For instance, I fully believe social media indirectly affected the 2016 presidential election by generating a kind of mass conversation that further polarized supporters of the two major candidates. In today\u2019s reality, these conversations often influence what becomes news \u2014 real or fake.Regardless of your sentiments about these mainstream discussions, not staying on top of them means you\u2019re excluding yourself from critical conversations with co-workers and clients. In the case of clients in particular, exposing yourself to diverse views expressed on social media will make it easier to find common ground, as you can expect to work with people from all walks of life and political backgrounds. This will not happen naturally if you visit the same publications every day (which are probably in line with your views), but it can happen on social media if you follow a well-rounded collection of sources. The main point is this: Social media is often where news \u2014 real or fake, in line with your views or not \u2014 is happening, and being aware of it is crucial for business professionals today.In the end, for these reasons and more, I don\u2019t support abandoning social media. I suggest we embrace it, fully and more actively than ever, but also thoughtfully and deliberately. In doing so, we create important career opportunities, from simply expanding our networks and improving our knowledge, to exposing ourselves to jobs we may not have previously considered.It\u2019s clear that social media is here to stay, so why not make it work for you?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Liberty University, All Sins Are Forgiven on the Altar of Football", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesThere was grand news out of Lynchburg, Va., last week: Liberty University announced that it had hired Ian McCaw, a \u201cgodly man of excellent character,\u201d as its athletic director.Liberty, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest Christian university, has large appetites, and it desires to vault into the big time. And McCaw, a man with the angular build and cobalt blue-eyed intensity of an ultramarathon runner, has achieved much success in his three decades in college sports.\u201cMy vision for Liberty is to position it as a pre-eminent Christian athletic program in America,\u201d McCaw said during a news conference in Lynchburg.McCaw is well acquainted with Christian athletics. In May, he left his job as the athletic director at Baylor, another eminent Christian university. His departure followed a devastating investigation that found that the leaders of the football team and the athletic department had looked away when told of multiple gang rapes and sexual assault.I would not bury a man without offering a dollop of praise. During McCaw\u2019s tenure, the football team prospered mightily. There were a Heisman Trophy winner, two Big 12 championships and breathless news media coverage of its down-home coach, Art Briles, and his whiskey-cured voice. And Baylor University leveraged that success into a $260 million stadium of the sort that spots the landscape of Texas like pimples on the rear of a steer.Liberty plays football in Division I\u2019s second rung. The university is run by Jerry Falwell Jr., a godly sort who understands the need for occasional accommodation with the secular world. Earlier this year he strolled around the Republican National Convention with his candidate, Donald J. Trump, a thrice-married man whom numerous women have accused of sexually harassing them.This did not please Liberty\u2019s students, who are expected to abide by the Liberty Way, which sets strict personal guidelines including, but not limited to, no NC-17 movies, no face piercings, no naughty music, and absolutely no canoodling, such as hanging out alone with a person of the opposite sex. Getting caught in a \u201cstate of undress\u201d with the opposite sex is good for a $250 fine and 18 hours of community service.When a Liberty student penned an editorial critical of Trump for the campus newspaper, Falwell censored it. (Liberty University also teaches Young Earth creationism, which is the belief that God created the universe, Earth and life in the last 10,000 years.)\u201cIf he made any mistakes at Baylor,\u201d Falwell said \u2014 let us pause here to appreciate his use of the conditional \u2014 \u201cthey appear to be technical and unintentional.\u201d There is not an athletic director in America, Falwell added, who better understands the importance of complying with federal guidelines on reporting any sexual assault on a campus.And thus tin is transmuted into gold.The report\u2019s summary gloried in passive language, and in an act of apparent Christian charity, it omitted all names and, therefore, any accountability.But this is what it meant, if not what it said: Athletic leaders (that would be McCaw) and football coaches learned of accusations of gang and date rape and decided not to report that violence; they met with the alleged victims, and their parents, and still did nothing.The football team existed in the same hermetic world found at too many top college programs. This, the report found, \u201creinforces the perception\u201d \u2014 and, of course, the reality \u2014 \u201cthat rules applicable to other students are not applicable to football players.\u201dMcCaw, who had spoken of his hand-in-glove working relationship with Briles, oversaw all of this. When Briles chose to bring in Sam Ukwuachu, a talented defensive end who transferred from Boise State, all involved should have known his background, which was deeply troubling.Ukwuachu was later sentenced to six months in jail and 10 years\u2019 probation.No good actors can be divined here. Our two Christian universities cannot even settle on a single narrative. Falwell claimed that McCaw had been beloved at Baylor and that his departure \u201cwas in no way a forced resignation or firing.\u201dWhat we have here is a contradiction. I called Baylor University\u2019s assistant vice president for communications, Lori W. Fogleman, and told her that Falwell had claimed to have conducted an investigation of the Baylor scandal.Did Falwell\u2019s people reach out to your people?\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she replied. I suggested that perhaps her university might wish to be more forthcoming.An hour or so later, she emailed me: \u201cThe university prefers not to comment.\u201dI was getting confused. So I called Len Stevens, a spokesman for Liberty University. He was a friendly fellow and quickly agreed that what we had here were conflicting accounts. Whom did your people talk to at Baylor, I asked. \u201cWe checked with Coach Grant Teaff, who knows lots of people there.\u201dTeaff, 83, is a football legend at Baylor. He last coached there in 1992 \u2014 11 years before McCaw\u2019s arrival.Liberty University officials did not ask to speak with Pepper Hamilton, the law firm that conducted the investigation, Stevens said. But they did chat with a couple of members of the Baylor Board of Regents, several of whom are not at all pleased that nettlesome accusations of gang rapes and assaults had pushed out a beloved coach and athletic director.I got off the telephone and reread Falwell\u2019s statement, which nearly swelled with charity for McCaw. \u201cHe is a good man who found himself in a place where bad things were happening and decided to leave,\u201d Falwell said, \u201cand now Liberty is the beneficiary.\u201dGod, or more to the point those people who desire a top football program and claim to hear his word, delivers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Science News That Stuck With Us in 2016", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byAs the year ends, the Science desk of The New York Times asked its reporters to look back at the news they reported on that was the most memorable. These are their selections, with a focus on archaeology, biology, physics and space.In age, the shipwrecks range from the Byzantine, to the Venetian, to the Ottoman empires, dating from the ninth to the 19th centuries. Archaeologists say the discoveries will shed light not only on the history of shipbuilding but ancient trade routes. Back then, ships on the Black Sea carried things like furs, horses, oils, cloth, grains, wine, satin, musk, perfumes, spices and jewels. Marco Polo reportedly visited the Black Sea, and Italian merchant colonies dotted its shores. The profits were so enormous that, in the 13th and 14th centuries, Venice and Genoa fought a series of wars for control of the trade routes.Where do dogs come from?Science may be getting closer to an answer to that question thanks to a broad survey of modern and ancient dog and wolf skulls and DNA.Most scientists who study dogs now agree that 15,000 or more years ago, one group of ancient wolves separated from another to become dogs, with different behavior and differences in skull shape and breeding patterns. People eventually took over the breeding of some dogs to get the qualities they wanted. But most dogs may have shadowed ancient human camps and farms and villages, living off garbage and handouts.In the 19th century, dog genetics was turned upside down when all sorts of new breeds were developed in what Dr. Larson calls \u201cthe giant whirlwind blender of the European crazy Victorian dog-breeding frenzy.\u201dRecently, Australian researchers used a particle accelerator called a synchrotron to get a high-resolution X-ray scan of the under painting, blasting a beam of high-energy light, a million times brighter than the sun, at the portrait.They were then ordered to mix the ashes with sand and bury the remains so no one would know of the atrocities committed at Ponar, an extermination site where the Nazis executed more than 100,000 people.For 76, days the prisoners dug a tunnel using only their hands and some spoons they found. On April 15, 1944, during the darkest night of Passover, they staged their escape. They climbed through the 100-foot tunnel and into the nearby woods. But the noise alerted the Nazi patrol, which fired at them. Only 12 of the original 80 escaped.Finally, there was physical evidence to help tell the tale of one of the greatest escape stories during the Holocaust.It was 1996. Dolly was a sheep, and I was a child. I didn\u2019t really get the details, but I knew she was a clone. My early take-away was that in the future, humans would all be clones that would die early from unanticipated, lethal mutations. It turned out a lot of adults were unsettled, too, by the story of Dolly, the cloned sheep with the health problems who died early, at the age of 6. Fearful of the medical consequences of cloning, along with other more dystopian concerns like ethics and cloning inefficiency, governments enacted bans across the world.Every year is Einstein\u2019s year, and 2016 was no exception.Yuri Milner, the Russian entrepreneur behind the project, said it could take 20 years to develop the technology and get underway.___Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oakland\u2019s \u2018Ghost Ship,\u2019 Site of Fire, Was a Motley Warehouse With a History", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The first complaint came in 2014. Piles of trash were reported next to the building. Later that year, construction materials blocking the sidewalk drew another complaint. Last month, another was lodged, leading to an investigation of illegal construction inside.The tragedy prompted questions about what officials should have done to shut down the motley tenement. It also brought attention to the boom in illegal housing across the region, where many people have resorted to makeshift living arrangements because they have been priced out of the regular market. The questions were many: How did the fire start? Was it accidental or deliberate? Will anyone be punished for the carnage?The building did not have a permit for residences, or one for performances. Its landlord had a history of owning properties with building violations. People who had lived in the warehouse or visited described a place rife with fire hazards \u2014 a boarded-up upstairs exit, a cobbled-together stairway made partly of wooden pallets, propane tanks used to heat water, and piles of flammable debris.\u201cIt was a complete maze \u2014 I mean, there was really no clearly marked exits,\u201d said Ben Phelps-Rohrs, who told the public radio station KCRW he stepped outside the concert just before the fire broke out. \u201cIt was a place where you could lose yourself.\u201dInspectors from Oakland\u2019s Planning and Building Department had opened an investigation into illegal construction after the third complaint, but many said the city did not do enough to respond.\u201cThe community complained about debris; we react to it, we go and we clean it up,\u201d said Jose Ortiz, a neighborhood activist. \u201cIt\u2019s really ridiculous that we have to end up with a tragedy like this for the city officials to react to it.\u201dAt a news briefing on Monday afternoon, Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city would do \u201ceverything we can to ensure that you will get, that the families will get, that this city will get the answers to every question about this incident.\u201dThe Alameda County district attorney, Nancy O\u2019Malley, said that her office had begun a criminal investigation but that it was too soon to speculate about potential charges. Investigators are looking into whether anyone should be held criminally liable for the fire, she said. When pressed, she said charges could range from murder to involuntary manslaughter.The buildings department said it sent an inspector to the warehouse on Nov. 17, three days after the illegal construction complaint, but the inspector was unable to gain entry. A fire department official said that without knowing the building was being used for housing or concerts, the department would have inspected only once every two years, and that on its most recent visit, it, too, was unable to enter.But some residents of the building questioned the idea that anyone had tried to inspect it. \u201cWe would have known if somebody from the city had come by to advise us about hazards,\u201d said Carmen Brito, who escaped the blaze.\u201cThat place was a tinderbox,\u201d said Danielle Boudreaux, who had visited many times. \u201cAnd anybody who went in there who had any kind of authority should have not allowed it to continue.\u201dBefore the fire thrust Oakland into the national spotlight, officials here had other preoccupations. The city, the most crime-ridden in California, has had six police chiefs in seven years, and remains without a permanent one after a scandal involving officers having sex with a young prostitute rocked the city government this summer.Code violations were not at the forefront of the officials\u2019 concerns.Oakland officials said the city takes illegal housing seriously, but there are so many informally converted spaces that building inspectors, firefighters and the police are overwhelmed by the problem. California law says that an inspector cannot enter unless admitted by an owner or resident, and officials say that people often refuse to let inspectors in, fearing eviction.What we know about the interior of the building that burned down on Friday.Fruitvale, the neighborhood where the Ghost Ship was located, is a dense grid of old industrial structures, houses and apartment buildings, populated mostly by Latino immigrants. It is well trafficked both by commuters headed to other parts of the Bay Area and by prostitutes who stand along the sidewalks of International Boulevard.The Ghost Ship was run by a married couple, Derick Ion Almena \u2014 also known as Derick Ion \u2014 and Micah Allison, whom residents described as the master tenants who rented the building and sublet parts of it to others. The building was owned by Chor Nar Siu Ng, who lives elsewhere in Oakland. It is unclear what Ms. Ng, who could not be reached for comment, knew about conditions inside.Current and former tenants said that when Ms. Ng or her daughter came by, Mr. Almena and Ms. Allison told tenants to pack away bedding and cooking supplies. Justin Manchester, who lived in the building for six weeks in 2014, said that the master tenants told other residents to hide in a nearby Wendy\u2019s restaurant when Ms. Ng visited.\u201cThey would usually prepare for days,\u201d he said, and they would tell tenants to \u201cmake your space look like nobody had been staying there.\u201dMr. Manchester, 25, who now lives in Texas, said that he moved to the Ghost Ship after being evicted from another warehouse known as Sugar Mountain, and that he knew of at least seven warehouses in Oakland, all creatively named, where artists lived under similar conditions, paying below-market rents.The Alameda County authorities took the couple\u2019s three children from them last year, after reports of neglect and unsafe conditions, according to Ms. Allison\u2019s father and a county official. The couple regained custody of the children, now ages 6, 7 and 13, several months later. The Alameda County Social Services agency said it could not comment, so it was unclear whether an inspection of the family\u2019s living arrangements was conducted.Mr. Almena pleaded no contest in January to a misdemeanor charge of receiving stolen property, an Airstream trailer, and was sentenced to three years probation. Some residents described having run-ins with him and accused him of cutting off the electricity of tenants he didn\u2019t like.Ms. Ng, who owns the building and the adjacent lot, bought the property in 1988. County records show that she and her family have owned several properties in Oakland, with a history of building violations that have caused the city to place liens against them.These include at least $1,000 for failure to fix unsafe conditions at a property on Eighth Street, and at least $3,000 for failure to fix conditions at a property on International Boulevard.And in 2007, the city issued liens for at least $6,800 for her failure to address unspecified conditions at 1305 31st Avenue, the property that would become the Ghost Ship. The liens on the building were paid off by 2014.Oakland has seen rents and home prices skyrocket with the local technology boom. Rents are up about 70 percent from five years ago \u2014 the fastest increase in the nation according to Zillow, the online real estate pricing service. The $2,899 median price is now just shy of cities like San Francisco and Manhattan.In Oakland, artists and musicians have long been using industrial warehouses as a cheap way to find a place to live and work in the same space.The paradox is that illegal housing is cheap partly because it is illegal, said Thomas Dolan, an Oakland architect who helps building owners convert warehouses.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a market economy, a gentrifying real estate market and people feeling that they need to go underground,\u201d he said.Julie Turkewitz, Thomas Fuller and Conor Dougherty reported from Oakland, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

Al Sharpton.We called him to ask about that day 45 years ago, and to talk about his history with the holiday.\u201cAt the beginning, it was very strange, because there I am using Swahili terms to young people,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re thinking, \u2018This guy\u2019s my brother\u2019s age.\u2019 \u201dThe goal for the young Mr. Sharpton, a Brooklyn native who had been celebrating Kwanzaa for two years at the time, was to instill values in his community, he said.\u201cI felt that young people who could not be reached at the church needed some values, even if we couldn\u2019t give them religion,\u201d he said.The secular holiday of Kwanzaa, which is based on principles like unity, creativity, purpose and self-determination, seemed like a way to accomplish that, he added.\u201cI had no idea it would grow to this level,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cThere was a need.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Not bad at all.It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be a white Christmas.We could be unwrapping some rain and a touch of wind on Saturday.And Christmas Day is forecast to be sunny and bright.Saturday Sunday Kwanzaa events abound in New York City.

However, researching the topic a little more definitely wouldn\u2019t hurt your case. I would say you exaggerated a little much on the way the abortion happens.\u201d_________Open-Minded AttitudesOne example comes from the forum on guns. A student ended her comment this way:\u201cBut that\u2019s my very Northeast, liberal, guns-aren\u2019t-a-part-of-my-life point of view, which I understand is different from many parts of the country. People for whom guns are an important part of daily life/feeling safe, how do you suggest we bring the numbers of homicides, suicides, and mass shootings down without restricting access to guns?\u201dAnother student then wrote back:\u201cI\u2019m also coming from a very North(west), liberal, guns-aren\u2019t-a-part-of-my-life point of view. Because of that, I felt content as I read through your comment. Near the end I almost resumed my casual scrolling through other responses when I saw your last paragraph.It sparked an epiphany: not enough people acknowledge their biases and, like you did here, directly ask the other party what they think is the best choice. In fact, most people forget that the middle ground of wanting to decrease tragedies like shootings, suicides, homicides, and et cetera even exists. In order for this debate to produce positive results, individuals need to familiarize themselves with compromise. I appreciate seeing that here at the end of your response.\u201d\u201cThe topic of immigration is so controversial. My opinions on it were flimsy until I read the Humans Of New York Facebook page. The photographer interviewed countless amounts of Syrian immigrants, and they had a chance to tell their story. All you hear about on the news is about how horrible immigrants are, and I had never thought about it being much different. Once I read their stories, though, it became such a moral issue.\u201dA notable number took both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton seriously and went to their websites to find and quote statements. They then seemed to be trying to puzzle out their own beliefs, rather than just regurgitating canned partisan arguments they had heard elsewhere:\u201cNorton, I can confidently say that I strongly agree with your statement of the hypocrisy in the situation. People do not realize their self contradiction when they say people are discriminated against but do the same towards others. For example I have heard of people being against Hillary Clinton simply because she is a woman. It is also important to note that police officers risk their lives every day to keep us safe, as you said. In addition, as shown by the recent killings of police officers, people are stereotyping police officers for being racist killers; this is obvious proof of hypocrisy in some advocates of the Black lives Matter movement.\u201d\u201cI agree with you in part, Jai, but i must say, crossing the border without permission is wrong, and they knew it. but i do understand that the conditions that the illegal immigrants may have lived in before attempting to cross the border might have been horrendous. there is no correct answer in my opinion, for the matter at hand. you either make them wait for a better life that may never happen, or they find other ways to come here to live a better life \u2026\u201d_________Evidence of Listening to and Supporting OthersRegion often seemed to play a role in students\u2019 points of view, and that may have been most clear in the guns forum. For example, some rural students stood up for gun rights, including one from Vermont:\u201cFor people like me, guns are part of your life. For most New Englanders, guns are used for hunting, whether it is a necessity to survive, or for sport.\u201d A handful of international students also posted, and many Americans seemed to appreciate it when they did:\u201cTy, as an American in the midst of this hotly debated topic, I think hearing a voice from abroad is crucial in dealing with this issue.\u201d\u201cHenry, I see where you are coming from when you express your distaste toward guns. \u2026 Your argument about not letting humans have guns is very good and I would be on board with this idea, but it is not practical. I say it is not practical because there will always be a way for people to obtain guns if they truly wanted them.\u201d\u201cI understand your frustration with illegal immigrants Sam, but I think the word illegal is what is really standing in your way of being compassionate here.\u201d\u201cSarah, your comment on the production of methane gases from cows is commonly overlooked.\u201d \u201cAnnabel, I did not know that you were a legal immigrant. I can see how it would hurt to have people against immigrants.\u201d_________Maturity of Thought and Language\u201cThe past couple weeks I read and analyzed a letter written by James Baldwin in 1962 in my english class, a time that we would consider racial injustice more of a violent and obvious issue. But I don\u2019t see many differences between the fear our citizens feel today and stand in awe with how much of this letter is still relevant to the problems we see today.\u201dThe most popular topic? Abortion. But students also brought up the economy, vaccines, the drinking age, Iran, the death penalty, space exploration, robots, education, college tuition, National Security Agency surveillance, drones, health care, respect for the national anthem, and the legalization of marijuana.As one student noted, all of these could have been better discussed by the candidates themselves:\u201cOne thing during this election season is that no one seems to be bringing up different issues it\u2019s always the same topics over and over, I want to see something new let them talk about how they are going to combat climate change.

On one hand, I support the legalization because of its lack of harmful physical effects, its prevalence, and the high rates of incarceration that stem from its use. But on the other hand, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand the negative effects it can have. I have friends whose curiosity has been stamped out of them by frequent smoking, who have given up other hobbies and interests, who seem to be in a perpetual cloud of haziness because they\u2019re always stoned or thinking about when they can next get stoned. I know that\u2019s not the case for all people, but I\u2019m wondering if you think legalization will make it more or less of a problem with teenagers. Will it be legal for teens? Will there still be legal penalties for teens caught selling/smoking weed?

{"Headline": "Can I Stay at a Hotel When Visiting My Crowded Family Home?", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported bySocial Q\u2019sI am 55 and the oldest of four siblings. We all congregate at our parents\u2019 home (with spouses and kids) over the holidays. Their place has many bedrooms but only two baths. The commotion is fun during the day, but at night, the house is overcrowded and noisy. For a few years, I have gotten a hotel room three blocks away. I only use it for sleeping and showering. But sleeping there, instead of on the couch, causes resentment in the family, especially from my mother. How can I explain that I don\u2019t mean offense?LISA, WISCONSINA couch is no place for a 55-year-old back \u2014 unless the couch in question belongs to your therapist, and you are discussing your unrelenting need to please your mother. It sounds as if you already know there is nothing unreasonable in your desire to slip away from the overcrowded fun house of your youth to bathe and sleep. Do you really need another adult to give you permission?I get that going home can trigger ancient rivalries and resentments, and even turn back the clock on hard-won maturity. But we are good people (for the most part). When someone asks something silly of you, while you\u2019re at home, take a breath and consider what grown-up Lisa would do in her real life. (Hint: She would probably not stand in a line six deep to take a shower when there is a viable alternative that she prefers.)Tell your mother: \u201cI love being here with you. And a good night\u2019s sleep helps me love it even more.\u201d No need to engage further. (Remember: She was probably born during the Depression; you will never convince her that a voluntary expenditure is not wasteful.) And the only reason your siblings care so deeply about your lodgings is probably jealousy that they can\u2019t stay there too. (Do I smell a gift idea brewing?)My oldest friend died suddenly last month. I will see his longtime wife when I go home for the holidays. I am having a hard time with this loss, especially as I remember how sharply his wife spoke to him, often with a nasty tone. I should have stuck up for him when he alive, but I didn\u2019t. Can I say something now?ANONYMOUSI am sorry for your loss. (I am also sorry for your friend\u2019s wife\u2019s loss.) And I am praying to the Elf on the Shelf that you will keep quiet about your grievance. You have both lost someone dear to you. But as anyone in a long-term relationship knows (perhaps even you), harsh words are not uncommon.For 15 years, a friend invited me to his large Christmas party. The invitations came by email. While I have great affection for him, we do not socialize or speak outside of this party. I have not been good about thanking him, and I don\u2019t give parties, so I could never reciprocate. A mutual friend tells me the party is happening soon. I believe that I was left off the guest list by mistake. Is there anything I can do? (I would find it too awkward to ask him directly.)G.G.Why are you forcing me to be mean today? Christmas is coming! After 15 years of unreciprocated hospitality (slurping down your friend\u2019s booze and gorging on his heavy hors d\u2019oeuvres \u2014 without so much as a thank-you text), this day had to come. I won\u2019t authorize crashing the party, and under the circumstances, I don\u2019t think you should ask mutual friends to intervene.Be honest: Will you miss your pal or his party? Satisfying reciprocation doesn\u2019t have to be tit-for-tat. You don\u2019t have to give a grand dinner-dance to pay him back. Any sign of friendship or appreciation will do. Early next year, call and invite him to coffee or lunch \u2014 or even for a catch-up chat. If that\u2019s too much, you don\u2019t belong at his party anyway.Around the holidays, I like to have some gifts on hand, in case friends or neighbors drop by with unexpected gifts for us. My wife thinks this is cold. You?J.P.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.

{"Headline": "Why Blue States Are the Real \u2018Tea Party\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byOpinionWhen the modern Tea Party movement coalesced in the early days of the Obama presidency, its allusion to the political grievances of the protesters in Boston Harbor a couple of hundred years earlier seemed plausible enough: Its members felt that their taxes were too high and their interests not adequately represented by the remote authorities in Washington.But the election of 2016 presents a challenge to that historical lineage. The home states to the Tea Party are actually doing great on the taxation and representation front. It\u2019s the progressive blue states that should be protesting.Start with the Electoral College. It has always deviated from the one-person-one-vote system that most Americans imagine they live in, but demographic shifts in recent years have made its prejudices more conspicuous, culminating in the striking gap between Hillary Clinton\u2019s decisive popular vote victory and her Electoral College loss. Thanks to the two extra votes delivered to each state for its two senators, the Electoral College gives less populated states a higher weight, per capita, than it gives more populated states in the decision of who should be the next president.The right way to think about the political conflict in this country is not red state versus blue state, but red country versus blue city. And yet we are voting in a system explicitly designed to tip the scales toward the countryside.But that\u2019s only part of the imbalance. When the founders were plotting the Electoral College, more urban states to the north had significant debt, while the rural Southern states were in better financial shape, thanks in part to the free labor of slavery. Recall the line from \u201cCabinet Battle #1\u201d from the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d:\u201cIf New York\u2019s in debt \u2014Why should Virginia bear it? Our debts are paid, I\u2019m afraidDon\u2019t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade\u201dThere\u2019s a straight line that connects that caricature of more urban Northern states living beyond their means in the late 1700s to Ronald Reagan\u2019s welfare queens in the 1980s: the prevailing sense that the big cities are dependent on government bailouts and benefits, while the less dense regions live responsibly. That sketch might have been accurate two centuries ago (at least if you took slavery out of the equation) but it bears no resemblance to the current economic map of the United States, where the major cities are now overwhelmingly the engines of economic growth and wealth creation \u2014 and also tax revenue.For complicated reasons \u2014 some of which have to do with rural poverty, some of which have to do with the basic physics of supporting infrastructure in low-density regions \u2014 a disproportionate amount of per capita federal spending and benefits now flow down to the low-density states. According to a study by the Tax Foundation conducted several years ago, for every dollar New Jersey pays in federal taxes, it receives 61 cents in benefits and other federal spending. For the same dollar of taxes Wyoming spends, it gets $1.11 back.Put those two trends together and you have a grievance worthy of the original Tea Party: more taxation with less representation. The urban states are subsidizing the rural states, and yet somehow in return, the rural states get more power at the voting booth.You can represent the injustice of this arrangement mathematically. Think of it as two different kinds of return on investment: how much does each state receive for every dollar it pays in taxes, and how much Electoral College influence does each state get for each vote cast. Take the average of those two data points and you have a measure of which states are getting shortchanged by the system. Call it the disenfranchisement index.The states that rank at the top of this list are the ones that are paying the highest proportion of the country\u2019s bills while ranking lowest in terms of voting power in the Electoral College. The first 12 on the list have all voted for the Democratic candidate in at least two of the last three elections, and all but two of them went for Mrs. Clinton in 2016: New Jersey, Minnesota, Illinois, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Wisconsin, Michigan, Connecticut, California, Washington and Oregon.Those states make up the overwhelming majority of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Electoral College support in 2016. They are also paying billions of dollars of taxes and receiving only a fraction back in benefits and other federal spending. By contrast, 19 of the 25 most empowered (and largely rural) states went for Mr. Trump.The gap between the two extremes is remarkable. South Dakota, one of the most empowered states in the country, received almost twice the return on taxes as California, the country\u2019s most populated state, while also commanding nearly twice as much power per capita in the Electoral College. If anyone should be declaring themselves the heirs to the Boston patriots who rebelled against the unjust taxation of King George, it\u2019s the big city blue state citizens who are funding a system that by law undercounts their votes.To date, wealthy states like California, New York and New Jersey have not expressed much outrage at this situation, in part because they have experienced less economic anxiety than some of the struggling red states and in part because the injustice has not been as visible during the Obama years, thanks to his Electoral College victories. But as our cities get wealthier and more diverse and begin to realize how the system is genuinely \u201crigged\u201d against them, tectonic forces may well be unleashed.If a Trump administration that urban states voted overwhelmingly against starts curtailing voting rights and rolling back drug-law reform, reneging on the Paris climate accord, deporting immigrants and appointing justices that favor overturning Roe v. Wade, states like California and Massachusetts are sure to start asking hard questions about why they are subsidizing a government that doesn\u2019t give them an equal vote.Advertisement"}

Truman. Instead of the sign that Truman kept on his desk declaring that \u201cThe Buck Stops Here,\u201d Trump should get one that says, \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d \u2014 embellished perhaps with the phony coat of arms he plastered on his Scottish golf course.A month after he won the presidential election, Trump is happy to take credit for things he likes \u2014 like the recent rebound in the stock market or the jobs that may be saved at that infamous Carrier plant thanks to millions of dollars the taxpayers of Indiana are going to pay.But he\u2019s also showing the world that he has no intention of taking responsibility for the hard stuff. Don\u2019t blame Trump, he said on Wednesday, for the deep divisions in American society.In other words, it\u2019s not Donald Trump\u2019s fault that racists, sexists, homophobes and xenophobes found common cause with his campaign, or that the darkest forces of the American right felt emboldened to give him the Nazi salute at a recent Washington gathering.On Dec. 1, Trump smiled happily as his followers chanted, \u201cLock her up!\u201d He did not attempt to quiet them, perhaps by saying that he had told The New York Times one day earlier that he did not want to prosecute Hillary Clinton. After all, Trump is not responsible for what his followers say.The obstinate refusal to take personal responsibility permeates the Trump organization.Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the new national security adviser, is not being held to account for spreading vile lies about Clinton on social media, even after those lies were connected to an armed invasion of a pizza place in Washington, D.C. Trump settled for firing Flynn\u2019s son from his transition team for his conspiracy-minded tweets.Stephen Bannon, the newly appointed chief strategist, is not to be held responsible, we are told, for all the racist and sexist garbage he published on Breitbart News. And Senator Jeff Sessions, whom Trump chose as attorney general, should not be accountable for his racist comments.At an event sponsored by Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics on Dec. 1, Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s third campaign manager, sputtered at the very idea that she might be blamed for the racism and xenophobia that Trump deliberately stoked to build his candidacy.\u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Conway said to Jennifer Palmieri, a top Clinton aide. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look me in the face and tell me that?\u201dIt is a fact that the Trump campaign gave a platform to white supremacists. The only question is whether the Trump presidency will do the same.Many Americans who voted for Trump may not consider themselves racist, but they cast a ballot for a candidate who espoused racism and xenophobia and told lie after lie without remorse. They have to take responsibility for their decision, and so do the people who choose to work for Trump.It has been sickening to see Mitt Romney, who achieved some respect when he denounced Trump during the campaign, bending his knee in hope of being named secretary of state. And what on earth was Al Gore thinking when he went to Trump Tower to talk about global warming? He looked like a fool.\u201cI think people aspire to do things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they aspire to watch people. I don\u2019t think they want to see the president carrying his luggage out of Air Force One. And that\u2019s pretty much the way it is.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Stephen Bannon\u2019s role in the coming Trump administration. He has been named chief strategist, not chief of staff. It also misspelled the name of the news organization Mr. Bannon led. It is Breitbart News, not Breibart News.Advertisement"}

Everything we hear, as we are told in a (sung) preshow announcement, is created by human voices.Acknowledging this is rather like admiring the ingenuity that must have gone into a sentimental picture of a rainbow, perhaps with the Care Bears in the foreground, rendered entirely in bottle caps. It\u2019s definitely something to have achieved such visual specificity out of bottle caps. But it\u2019s still a picture of a rainbow with Care Bears.The notion of diverse souls melding into a single, multi-stranded voice is central to \u201cIn Transit,\u201d which has a multi-stranded plot in which stressed people in conflict learn how to get along. And the New York subway system, whose cars and platforms are regularly graced with free-styling buskers, certainly provides a fitting context.For the fortune-cookie versions of these lessons, lost souls can turn to the sage of the subway, a musician named Boxman (alternately played by Chesney Snow and Steven \u201cHeaveN\u201d Cantor). He\u2019s not only a one-man sound-effects whiz; he\u2019s also brimming with wise words about the importance of being in the moment.Though the characters\u2019 problems are often related to contemporary technology (texting, Facebook posts, \u201creply all\u201d emails), they also summon the weary inspirational uplift of vintage television Christmas movies. The likable, hard-working cast does achieve marvels of vocal synchronicity in backing up one another\u2019s solos. (The only song that made me smile was a sardonic number about giving up on your ideals, led by Ms. Angela.)But the Broadway-style belters\u2019 voices, which are abrasively amplified, are often at odds with the aural smoothness of a cappella.

(Ken Travis did the sound design.)\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d she yells, and the whole world goes still.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Game Will Go On\u2019 as U.S. Expels Russian Diplomats", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The spies are not particularly difficult to find. What is difficult is deciding what to do with them.For more than 70 years, Moscow has filled its embassy and consulates in the United States with intelligence operatives \u2014 as Washington does with its own diplomatic outposts in Russia \u2014 giving them the mission of stealing the most significant secrets of a longtime adversary. It is the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s job to identify and track the operatives, part of a routine cat-and-mouse game.But it is a rare and provocative act for the White House or the Kremlin to publicly expel diplomats, as the Obama administration did on Thursday. Current and former government officials described the delicate calculations, and no small amount of gamesmanship, that go into making such decisions.Sometimes, American presidents decide to expel Russians who are thought to have done real damage with their espionage, and sometimes the expulsions are intended to send a warning shot to Moscow, with the expelled officials serving as pawns in a chess match.\u201cI think it will have a short-term effect on Russian intelligence collection within the United States,\u201d said Kevin Favreau, a former top F.B.I. counterintelligence officer, speaking of President Obama\u2019s decision to expel 35 Russians and their families.\u201cBut the game will go on,\u201d he said, \u201cand intelligence officers are always replaceable.\u201dAmerican officials said that in the weeks before Thursday\u2019s announcement, the White House asked the F.B.I. and American intelligence agencies for a list of names of Russians who may have conducted espionage. Mr. Obama had decided to order the expulsions in response to what the administration called a campaign by Russia to disrupt the presidential election, as well as harassment of American diplomats posted in Russia.The administration decided to target Russians in Washington and San Francisco, a move that former federal law enforcement officials said was not particularly surprising. Jeffrey Harp, a former F.B.I. officer who helped oversee counterintelligence analysis in San Francisco until his retirement in 2015, said the Russians had extensive intelligence-gathering operations in the Bay Area.\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s always been an issue with the proximity to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just corporate espionage. The Bay Area is home to a lot of military installations.\u201dIt was \u201cbizarre and ridiculous,\u201d the consulate said in the message, to identify the officers as spies. Among those being expelled, it said, was the diplomatic post\u2019s chef, \u201cwhose mastery was enjoyed by hundreds of our guests\u201d for three years. \u201cWe will not be able to treat you with authentic Russian food any more,\u201d the message said.Former officers said the F.B.I. considered a number of factors when deciding whom to expel.Generally, Mr. Favreau said, \u201cit would be those diplomats who are most suspected of being involved in active political, military or economic intelligence activity collection.\u201d In other words, the Russians thought to be having the most success in stealing American secrets.But sometimes there are more strategic considerations at play. During the Cold War, the F.B.I. sometimes kept active Russian spies off its expulsion lists so that Moscow might suspect that they had been recruited as American agents.\u201cThe bureau would play a little game,\u201d said Ray Batvinis, who spent 25 years as an F.B.I. counterintelligence officer until his retirement in 1997. \u201cThey wanted to foster a bit of suspicion.\u201dMr. Batvinis said that during the Reagan administration, the F.B.I. often clashed with the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department over the wisdom of expelling Russian spies. The other two agencies worried that such a move would prompt the Kremlin to thin the ranks of American diplomats and spies in Russia.At the height of the Cold War, the Russian intelligence presence in the United States was so much greater than that of the C.I.A. in Russia \u2014 possibly by a 10-to-1 ratio, Mr. Batvinis said \u2014 that any move by Moscow to expel C.I.A. officers could significantly weaken the agency\u2019s operations in Russia.That dynamic changed in late 1986, when President Ronald Reagan became so angry about a string of damaging thefts of American secrets that he expelled 80 Soviet diplomats. The Soviets responded by expelling dozens of American government employees.Little has changed since the Cold War for F.B.I. counterintelligence officers who track Russian spies. Their job is to follow and sometimes harass operatives working for Russian intelligence agencies, as well as to try to recruit them as American agents.The recruitment efforts have had some success, according to former law enforcement officials, and in recent years the F.B.I. even believed that it might be able to lure the Washington chief of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, known as the S.V.R. In the end, the man refused the bureau\u2019s overtures.Last year, the F.B.I. broke up an S.V.R. spy ring in New York when officers arrested a Russian man working for a bank under nonofficial cover. That led to the expulsion of two S.V.R. operatives. According to a criminal complaint, the F.B.I. had been closely monitoring a Manhattan office used to transmit intelligence to headquarters in Russia.The F.B.I.\u2019s head of counterintelligence called the case \u201cegregious,\u201d and former bureau officials said that over the past year, some in the F.B.I. wanted to make several more arrests similar to the one in New York.Those requests were denied, they said, out of concern for what the Russians might do to retaliate.Michael S.

He parks his truck about 50 yards away, he waits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and he waits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe usual thing is nothing happens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when it comes good, it really comes good.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOften he makes one image a week, but occasionally, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get as many as three or four. As he sees it, in his successful images, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is as if one animal in a group is taking pictures of another.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Shah grew up in Kenya, with wildlife on his doorstep. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy parents used to take me to national parks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then when I could drive, I would just take off.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut as he got older, he put some distance between himself and wildlife, setting off to study in the U.K. He got a Ph.D. and a position lecturing on mathematical economics, then spent about 10 years teaching and publishing before he realized that his heart wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in it.On the reserve, which is west of Nairobi, Mr. Shah lives a quiet life. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a smartphone, and for the most part, he stays disconnected from politics. While waiting for animals to come, he reads novels. He just finished \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Great Gatsby\u00e2\u0080\u009d and hopes to tackle many more classics, he said, beginning with American authors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waiting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour brain is so hungry for a stimulus that the classics just let me get at them; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOf course, a photographer is not always alone on one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most famous reserves. When tourists come to see the annual \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat Migration\u00e2\u0080\u009d of zebras and wildebeests across the reserve, people often stop to say hello. They ask Mr. Shah why he is sitting alone, away from the pack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crazy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomebody will come and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, you know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pride of lions and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to do something exciting,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, you know, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not interested.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe is interested, instead, in capturing something natural, spontaneous and authentic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something that will help a human viewer understand an animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality.For instance, he said, lions \u00e2\u0080\u009chave real depth in their eyes. And when you make contact, you can see the intelligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile he appreciates documentary work, Mr. Shah said he is \u00e2\u0080\u009dtrying to get beyond that and see if I can make my photography more expressive; something that people can look at twice and find some connection. And that takes time. The animals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give their secrets out easily. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be hard to get.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Refugee\u2019s Arrest Turns a Crime Into National News (and Debate) in Germany", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 When a 19-year-old medical student was found raped and drowned in the university city of Freiburg in October, it was seen as a sad and awful crime, but a local one. Beyond a few tabloids, the story failed to make national headlines.But only after Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of her cabinet weighed in on the fierce debate over that question did the country\u2019s leading public broadcaster, ARD, pick up the story, which it had originally judged did not meet the threshold for national news.Over the past week, citizens, politicians and journalists have wrestled with the reality that to the German public, it seems that a crime committed by a migrant is of national interest and importance, while a similar one committed by a German is, perhaps, not.ARD\u2019s earlier decision not to report on the crime set off further anger and accusations that the country\u2019s \u201cliberal media elite\u201d were intent on protecting migrants, going so far as to underreport or even cover up their crimes.The differing views have revealed deep rifts in German society between those who support Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision to welcome some one million migrants and those who view the newcomers, who are mostly Muslim, as a threat to the country\u2019s stability and security.Typing the German words \u201care migrants\u201d into Google\u2019s search engine in Germany completes the phrase with \u201cmore criminal than Germans\u201d on its second suggestion. In an attempt to calm a heated debate and answer just that question, Germany\u2019s Federal Criminal Office, or BKA, released statistics in June about migrant criminality last year.Less than 10 percent of Germany\u2019s population of 81 million people is foreign born. Of the roughly two million people investigated for all crimes, just 6 percent were migrants.Of 2,721 crimes that ended in a death, migrants were responsible for 233, or about 9 percent. And of 1,683 cases of sexual abuse, including rape, migrants were responsible for about 5 percent.All of those percentages were at least double the previous year\u2019s, but the BKA report noted that the migrant population had increased by 357 percent.In short, it was not a particularly damning portrait.After members of Ms. Merkel\u2019s cabinet and other leading politicians from across the spectrum joined the debate, Kai Gniffke, ARD\u2019s editor in chief, defended the station\u2019s decision in a blog post.After careful consideration, he said, editors did not consider the crime in Freiburg to be any different from the roughly 300 other murders that take place in Germany each year. But as the crime, and the station\u2019s handling of it, became the center of a stormy national debate, ARD changed its mind, even inviting Ms. Merkel on the evening news program to comment.\u201cIf it should emerge that it was an Afghan refugee, then that must be condemned, as would be with every other murder,\u201d the chancellor told ARD. But she warned against condemning or targeting all refugees, stressing that \u201cthe case remains a tragic event that must be cleared up, and must be openly discussed.\u201dHer conservative Christian Democrats have begun taking a harder line, passing a resolution at their party congress this week aimed at toughening penalties for forced marriage and honor killings and urging an end to dual citizenship.The far right has been quick to seize on crimes like the murder in Freiburg of Maria Ladenburger, whose body was spotted in the Dreisam River by a jogger on Oct. 17, the morning after she was killed.The police say they identified the suspect \u2014 a 17-year-old whose name they gave only as Hussein K., in keeping with German privacy law \u2014 through DNA evidence from a strand of hair found near the crime scene.In the aftermath, Hans Peter Stauch, a member of the legislature in the state, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, for the rightist-populist Alternative for Germany party, warned of future dangers.\u201cThe refugees that have come to us are certainly not per se to be marked as bad or criminal,\u201d he wrote in a letter to a local newspaper, The Reutlinger Wochenblatt. \u201cBut it would be and is na\u00efve, if not outright careless, to declare that through such uncontrolled immigration \u2018only\u2019 the peaceful and good people have come here.\u201cIt is equally na\u00efve and careless to believe that especially the young men, who have been socialized in an archaic value system from the Middle Ages, will be magically transformed into enlightened, socially acceptable democrats after they cross our borders,\u201d he added.Such feelings have made editorial decisions especially wrenching for the country\u2019s two main broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, which are funded by a public that increasingly wants a say in how its money is spent.\u201cThe public broadcasters, even more than commercial media outlets, must become transparent about their processes and how they make decisions,\u201d said Leonard Novy, a political scientist at the Institute for Media and Communication Policy in Cologne.\u201cWhether these institutions are able to survive in the future depends on this, because they are not simply accepted today as they were in the past,\u201d he added.The struggle to put the crime in its place was not limited to the broadcasters, however. Many traditional news media also questioned whether it should be treated as the terrible act of one individual, or said anything larger about clashes of culture and the integration of refugees in Germany society.\u201cA terrible crime happened in Freiburg,\u201d Reinhard M\u00fcller wrote in an editorial critical of ARD\u2019s decision in a conservative newspaper, The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which began covering the murder in November, after it was broadcast on a national television show about unsolved crimes.\u201cIt is of course debatable how these incidents should be covered. But is it really acceptable not to cover a crime because it has possibly been perpetrated by a young asylum seeker?\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller wrote.\u201cThat would mean that the German media are saying that they are not interested in stories that the German public is,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is a slippery slope.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Since Birth: Trump\u2019s Children and the Tangle That Awaits", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byMs. Trump is nearing a licensing deal with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, both parties told The New York Times. The largest shareholder of Sanei\u2019s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government.Discussions for the deal have been active for about two years, Ms. Trump\u2019s company said. In that time, she has become something of a local fascination. \u201cAt the moment,\u201d said Sayumi Gunji, a lifestyle-magazine editor who attended the viewing, \u201cIvanka is even more popular here than Mr. Trump.\u201dSince his election, Mr. Trump has chafed at the suggestion that keeping his business in the family could create problems, despite several episodes during his transition that seemed to mix business and diplomacy. While he has insisted that he faces no legal requirement to turn over the company, the Trump Organization has said it is preparing an \u201cimmediate transfer of management\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s three eldest children \u2014 Donald Jr., 38; Ivanka, 35; and Eric, 32 \u2014 along with a team of executives.Last week, the president-elect said on Twitter that he would make an announcement with the children on Dec. 15 about \u201cleaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country.\u201d Doing so is \u201cvisually important,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.\u201dYet an examination of the professional histories of the three children \u2014 who also serve on the presidential transition team \u2014 shows how deeply the Trump family, Trump business and Trump politics are interwoven, raising significant doubts about how meaningful a wall can ever be erected between Mr. Trump and his heirs at the Trump Organization.For years, the three siblings have operated with few rigid dividing lines in their international travels as ambassadors of the Trump brand, allowing them to lean heavily on the reputation and financial backing of their father while establishing their own credibility in business.It is not merely that the Trumps are at peace commingling family and business. They have known no other way.Officially, all three siblings are executive vice presidents for development and acquisitions. Practically, they have served as their father\u2019s advance guard: the polished public faces of the next Trump generation, conducting initial meetings with prospective partners and reporting back to Mr. Trump.\u201cWe don\u2019t take titles particularly seriously at the Trump Organization,\u201d Ms. Trump said in a deposition this year. In depositions in 2011, both brothers likened the company to a \u201cmom and pop\u201d operation.Since the three joined the business, shortly after each graduated from college, lines have had a way of blurring.When Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s investment in a concrete paneling business in South Carolina faltered in recent years, leaving him personally responsible for a loan of more than $3 million, the Trump Organization helped bail him out.Ms. Trump, the only sibling to match her father\u2019s instinct for self-commodification, has used the Trump Organization\u2019s payroll, information technology and human resources for her separate brand. Her website\u2019s domain was registered by Trump Organization lawyers.\u201cIt is, of course, an advantage to be my father\u2019s daughter,\u201d Ms. Trump told an audience in Malaysia, via videoconference, in 2008. \u201cI think it has afforded me many great opportunities.\u201dAll three children declined to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to written questions sent to the Trump Organization about their outside business ties. In its statement about the transfer of management, the Trump Organization said that \u201cthe structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations.\u201d\u201cGiving to the Trump family would be seen by many foreign leaders as the way to get in with the Trump administration,\u201d said Meredith McGehee, an adviser to the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group, who worried that companies might be tempted to direct business to the Trump children to curry favor with their father.Already, complications abound.The children each hold a stake in the lease that allows the organization to operate the Trump International Hotel out of the federal government\u2019s Old Post Office Building in Washington. Mr. Trump, as president, will appoint the head of the General Services Administration, which manages the property, while his children oversee a hotel with millions of dollars in ties to the agency.In addition to attending the meeting with Mr. Abe, Ms. Trump was present for her father\u2019s initial conversation with President Mauricio Macri of Argentina. The children also met recently with Jose E. B. Antonio, a Philippine developer who is collaborating with the Trumps on a tower in Manila and who in October was named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte.The business partnership grew out of a friendship between Mr. Antonio\u2019s son Robbie and Ms. Trump. Eric Trump is also listed on an advisory committee for one of the younger Mr. Antonio\u2019s ventures: a company making luxury modular homes.Even nonbusiness expeditions have grown more tense since Election Day. Over Thanksgiving weekend, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to hunt wild goats in Turkey, where the elder Mr. Trump has \u201ca little conflict of interest,\u201d he acknowledged in a radio interview last year, because of \u201ca major, major building in Istanbul\u201d \u2014 actually twin Trump Towers. Security for the hunt was high, with private guards and Turkish intelligence officers, according to an official involved in the trip who was not authorized to discuss it.At times, the president-elect has grown incredulous when pressed on the specter of conflicts.He allowed, though, that his election had changed at least one thing.\u201cThe brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care.\u201dGrooming began early in the Trump family.For as long as they can remember, the children visited job sites, as Mr. Trump had done as a boy with his father, Fred. They sat in on meetings with executives and government officials, where, between fits of deal-making, Mr. Trump held forth on his daughter\u2019s progress in school. They came to learn that the surest way to reach Mr. Trump was to call the office.Despite this lengthy tutelage, Mr. Trump resisted a presidential run in 2012 in part because he did not believe his children were ready to succeed him. (The president-elect also has a daughter Tiffany, 23, from his second marriage, and a son Barron, 10, with his current wife, Melania.)While the eldest three have been presented, with Trumpian gusto, as business successes of the highest order, there have been some stumbles \u2014 cushioned often by the built-in advantages of being a Trump.The succession plan itself has not always been smooth. For a time, Donald Jr., who did not speak to his father for a year after his parents\u2019 divorce, was ambivalent about joining the business, spending a year after college in Colorado working in a bar and hunting in his spare time.Since joining the Trump Organization in 2001, moving quickly to learn the intricacies of financing and construction, he has said repeatedly that he does not expect preferential treatment.\u201cHe puts on zero in the way of airs,\u201d said Mel M. Immergut, a lawyer in New York who has long known the younger Mr. Trump and said he did not support the elder\u2019s candidacy, or anyone else\u2019s.Donald J. Trump\u2019s global business empire will create an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest for a United States president, experts say.But as Donald Jr. has sought to establish his own business identity, he has borrowed from his father\u2019s playbook \u2014 and, occasionally, his payroll.He and Ivanka were paid speakers at a \u201ccreating wealth\u201d forum that was described as free but featured event promoters seeking to enlist attendees for expensive courses on how to get rich.He has positioned himself as a spokesman for a hodgepodge of companies, including Cambridge Who\u2019s Who, a publisher that produces a registry in which consumers pay to be listed. The younger Mr. Trump spoke about the company during interviews on Fox Business Network and TheStreet.com.In 2011, Donald Jr. also became the public face of a Tulsa, Okla.-based company, MacroSolve, that primarily sued other companies, like Facebook and Walmart, over claims that they had infringed on its patent for a mobile device application. After several setbacks in court, the company has changed its focus.Yet it is his foray into South Carolina manufacturing that offers perhaps the most unfiltered view of Donald Jr.\u2019s independent business dealings.In 2010, the younger Mr. Trump helped found a company in the depressed suburb North Charleston called Titan Atlas Manufacturing, which made cast panels for prefabricated houses.Along with the North Charleston project, Mr. Trump and Mr. Blackburn sought business deals in Mexico and Colombia, traveling with executives of the Trump Organization and Yun Capital, an investment firm involved in Trump Organization projects abroad. In 2011, Yun Capital registered the trademark JB Development on Mr. Blackburn\u2019s behalf, filings show.By 2012, Titan Atlas was mired in debt, prompting a suit from a Philadelphia law firm it had hired to represent it. The firm claimed it was owed $400,000 in unpaid fees.After Mr. Blackburn filed for personal bankruptcy, the law firm turned its attention to Donald Jr., issuing a subpoena for him to testify about Titan Atlas\u2019s assets.The Trump Organization jumped to his defense. In a letter on company letterhead, Alan Garten, the organization\u2019s general counsel, threatened to file a disciplinary complaint about a lawyer at the firm if he sought to bring Donald Jr. into the case.A letter from Alan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, threatened a disciplinary complaint about a lawyer seeking to question Donald Trump Jr. in a lawsuit.In an interview, Mr. Garten said he had been \u201casked to assist\u201d in resolving the matter even though it fell outside the purview of the Trump Organization.\u201cIf Don makes an investment in a company and legal assistance is needed, I\u2019m happy to get involved,\u201d Mr. Garten said, adding, \u201cI have always viewed my role as representing not just the company but its principals.\u201dThe firm in Philadelphia pressed ahead with its suit despite the threat. On the eve of Donald Jr.\u2019s testimony, though, a confidential settlement was reached.Separately, in late 2014, the Trump Organization formed an entity that took over a $3.65 million loan made by Deutsche Bank in 2011 to Titan Atlas. The younger Mr. Trump had been a co-signer on the loan. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, which is a major lender to the Trump Organization, declined to disclose the details of that transaction.Mr. Garten described Donald Jr. as a \u201cpassive\u201d investor in Titan Atlas.Asked why the Trump Organization had taken over an unrelated business loan to the younger Mr. Trump, Mr. Garten said he \u201ccan\u2019t speak to that.\u201d\u201cThis was an investment made by Don,\u201d Mr. Garten said. \u201cUltimately, it was not successful.\u201dThe siblings occupy neighboring offices on Trump Tower\u2019s 25th floor, one level below their father. They often gather for a breakfast meeting at the Trump Grill. They hold equivalent titles at the Trump Organization.There is little doubt, though, whom Mr. Trump admires most.Ms. Trump\u2019s image as a stylish businesswoman, and now mother, has long lifted her brand, steering Ivanka Trump products into stores from Alabama to Kuwait and establishing her as the second-most famous Trump. Department stores throughout the country sell Ivanka Trump shoes, Ivanka Trump clothes, Ivanka Trump handbags.She has traveled widely \u2014 sometimes with her father or brothers, often without them \u2014 as a fresher face of the family brand, at times convening with foreign dignitaries: an adviser to the Ukrainian president; a governor of Rio de Janeiro; Queen Rania of Jordan.Often wearing the kinds of heels and sheath dresses sold under her name, Ms. Trump stars in an impeccably curated Instagram feed, filled with product placement, pictures of her children and the promotion of a hashtag: #womenwhowork.With Mr. Trump\u2019s election, at least one licensing partner quickly sensed an opportunity. After Ms. Trump appeared with her father on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d reporters received an email promoting the bracelet she had worn on the program: a $10,800 bangle from her own line.Amid criticism that Ms. Trump was using her father\u2019s victory for financial gain, her company announced that it was \u201cproactively discussing new policies and procedures.\u201d Ms. Trump has also said she will separate her personal Twitter and Instagram accounts from those of her brand, which she wholly owns.Given its international renown, that brand is likely to flourish under a Trump administration regardless of social media strategy.In 2013, before the debut of a major clothing partnership, about $75 million worth of handbags, shoes and other products bearing Ms. Trump\u2019s name sold at wholesale, according to a company document reviewed by The Times. Of that, Ms. Trump\u2019s company would have received roughly $4 million to $6 million, according to people familiar with the business\u2019s financial data who were not authorized to speak publicly.In Japan, where news of her inclusion in the meeting with Mr. Abe inspired a media frenzy, she has become an object of intrigue for her glamorous image and powerful position in the Trump orbit. Japanese news reports often refer to her as Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbeloved\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d daughter.The expected deal with Sanei, the Japanese apparel company, is the result of a longstanding relationship between Sanei and Abigail Klem, an executive for Ms. Trump\u2019s company who previously worked for Diane von Furstenberg, a label that Sanei licenses in Japan, according to Ms. Trump\u2019s team. Her company said the terms of the agreement had been decided before the election.To date, Ivanka Trump apparel and jewelry have been available to Japanese shoppers through a small number of independent import sites. One of them, waja.co.jp, has reported a 28-fold increase in sales since the election, according to the local news media.On the home front, one of Ms. Trump\u2019s ventures was less successful.In 2007, Ms. Trump opened Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry on Madison Avenue, a short walk from Trump Tower. Her brothers had offered guidance, at least briefly, during a tour before the opening, flagging a structural misalignment in a bathroom.Like many other Trump family endeavors, the jewelry business was a licensing deal. Rings and necklaces in the Ivanka Trump line came through a partnership with a diamond wholesaler based in New York.In 2011, as Ms. Trump\u2019s store migrated to a space in SoHo, troubles mounted. Ms. Trump\u2019s partner, Madison Avenue Diamonds, which operated Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, was sued by a former supplier, KGK, which claimed to be owed more than $2 million. The partner\u2019s lawyers accused KGK of incorporating fake stones into Trump-branded jewelry, saying that some gold pieces had \u201cat times turned wearers\u2019 skin green.\u201dBy the time the problem was discovered, the lawyers wrote, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry had already sold 119 of the more than 250 problematic pieces, \u201cpotentially creating a public relations disaster\u201d that would endanger the business.KGK won its suit for reasons unrelated to the stones, whose authenticity was never proved or disproved in court. The supplier denied the allegations in court documents.Y. David Scharf, a lawyer for Madison Avenue Diamonds, said that \u201cextensive efforts were taken to remove the nonconforming items from the market\u201d and that all requests for exchanges had been honored. There was an attempt to contact anyone who had purchased the products in question, Mr. Scharf added, but not every customer could be reached.The licensing arrangement has allowed Ms. Trump to maintain a safe distance from any turmoil, and Ivanka Trump jewelry is still sold worldwide. But the SoHo store closed without fanfare last year.There is not, at least so far, much of an Eric Trump brand to license.By most accounts, though, the youngest child of Donald J. Trump and Ivana Trump has been an effective steward of the Trump Winery in Virginia, which has won local acclaim for its sparkling and still wines.Eric Trump, who oversees the family\u2019s golf courses, has also shown that he is comfortable with conflict.Shortly after the Trump Organization bought a luxury spa and golf course in Jupiter, Fla., in 2012, some club members filed a lawsuit claiming that the company had violated their rights by barring them from the facility, among other matters. The Trump Organization has said it did nothing wrong, and the case remains undecided.The legal dispute centered on the contracts signed by members with the Jupiter facility\u2019s previous owner, Ritz-Carlton. To join, members paid initiation fees ranging from $35,000 to $210,000, deposits that were refundable when they resigned. But that process could take years, and under Ritz-Carlton rules, those on the resignation list could still use the club if they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums.When the Trump Organization acquired the club, it also assumed liability for those refunds, a pool of deposits totaling $41 million. But the company was eager to convert deposits into cash that could be used to improve the club.Soon, a letter arrived, signed by Donald J. Trump. It offered to reduce members\u2019 annual fees if they agreed to convert refundable deposits into nonrefundable ones and suggested that members who wanted to resign were \u201cout.\u201d\u201cI do not want to them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues,\u201d the note read.But Mr. Trump testified in a deposition last year that although he had signed the letter, Eric Trump was in charge. \u201cEric is much more familiar with this club,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe runs it.\u201dEric Trump contended in his pretrial testimony that members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid annual dues. \u201cThe status quo was maintained,\u201d he said in a 2015 deposition.During a two-day trial in August, he was forced to backtrack. Members and club employees testified that those on the resignation list had been barred from using the club even while they received bills.Presented with this evidence, Eric Trump acknowledged that his earlier statements had been mistaken. Juggling different policies at the family\u2019s assorted clubs was difficult, he explained.But on balance, the younger Mr. Trump testified, the estate had thrived on the family\u2019s watch.\u201cWe took something that had gone really bad,\u201d he said, \u201cand we made it great again.\u201dReporting was contributed by Susanne Craig, Michael Barbaro, Maggie Haberman, Steve Eder, Richard C.

Survivors stood across the street in a Wendy\u2019s parking lot, watching firefighters try to put out the blaze and rescue those inside.Oakland officials said the building, a rambling warehouse they described as \u201ca labyrinth of artist studios,\u201d had been under investigation for several months. They said escape from the building, which had only two exits, might have been complicated because the first and second floors were linked by an ad hoc staircase made of wooden pallets.By Saturday afternoon, a list of those missing, compiled by friends and family, had grown to about 35 people. Officials said that the nine bodies recovered were in areas accessible to rescue crews, and that they had not been able to search the rest of the smoldering, unsafe building for at least two dozen people still missing and feared to be dead inside.\u201cWe know that there are bodies in there that we cannot get to, that have been seen but have not been recovered,\u201d Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office said at an evening news conference.Others who were believed to be missing have been accounted for, he said, adding, \u201cWe have been able to put some families\u2019 fears at ease.\u201dEarlier on Saturday, Sergeant Kelly said the authorities were \u201cexpecting the worst, maybe a couple dozen victims.\u201d\u201cIt appears that people either made it out or they didn\u2019t make it out,\u201d he said.Firefighters arrived just before midnight Friday, and the fire was still smoldering more than 12 hours later.One survivor, Aja Archuleta, 29, a musician, was scheduled to perform at the electronic music party with her synthesizers and drum machines around 1 a.m. and was working at the door when the fire broke out around 11 or 11:15 p.m.11 Photos\u201cThere were two people on the first level who had spotted a small fire that was growing quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very quick and chaotic build, from a little bit of chaos to a lot of chaos.\u201dShe added, \u201cI have lost 20 friends in the past 24 hours.\u201dFamily members of the missing expressed anguish over spending hours waiting to know if their relatives were inside.Daniel Vega, 36, said he was \u201cinfuriated\u201d waiting to hear news about his 22-year-old brother, Alex Vega, who had not answered his phone Saturday morning. Mr. Vega said he had heard from a friend that his brother was at the party.\u201cGive me some gloves. I\u2019ve got work shoes. I\u2019m ready,\u201d Mr. Vega said. \u201cLet me find my brother, that\u2019s all I want.\u201dThe building\u2019s roof had collapsed, and the site was a dangerous scene of debris, beams and other wreckage. The structure had a permit to function as a warehouse, but not as a residence or for a party. Officials said they were investigating reports that the building had also been used as a living space.At the news conference, Mayor Libby Schaaf said: \u201cThis is complicated. And it\u2019s going to take us time to do the investigation that these families deserve.\u201dThe building, known as the Ghost Ship, in the Fruitvale neighborhood, was the site of an event that was to feature a range of experimental and electronic music, performed by a synth musician drawing from the \u201cblack, queer diaspora\u201d and others, as well as a visual installation. On Saturday morning, the event\u2019s Facebook page said admission to the show was $10 for those who arrived before 11 p.m. and $15 after that. By the end of the day, the pricing had disappeared and the page had turned into an emergency message board, as dozens of friends and family members posted about missing loved ones.\u201cA lot of these people are young people,\u201d Sergeant Kelly said. \u201cThey are from all parts of our community.\u201d Some of the dead may be citizens of other countries, he said.Emergency workers said they arrived to find the building filled with heavy smoke and flames. Bodies were found on the second floor of the building, Chief Teresa Deloach Reed of the Oakland Fire Department said Saturday.\u201cIn my career of 30 years, I haven\u2019t experienced something of this magnitude,\u201d she said.Even without a full accounting, the fire was one of the deadliest in the United States in many years. In 2003, 100 people were killed in a fire in a nightclub in West Warwick, R.I. An explosion at a fertilizer plant in Texas in 2013 killed 15 people.Chief Deloach Reed said there were \u201cno reports of smoke alarms going off.\u201d At least two fire extinguishers were inside, she said.On the event\u2019s Facebook page, people distributed a spreadsheet that listed identifying information \u2014 age, height, weight, hair color, tattoos \u2014 and contact numbers for many of those who were unaccounted for.Oakland\u2019s music and art scene was already struggling with high rent prices. The city\u2019s underground bands and artists live a seminomadic existence in search of warehouses, homes and other spaces to show art, play music and dance into the early hours.Diego Aguilar-Canabal, 24, a blogger and freelance writer who lives in Berkeley and plays guitar in a band called the Noriegas, estimated he had been to three dozen house and warehouse parties over the past two years.\u201cThe basic idea is people want to do loud things late at night, and industrial space is really good for that because there aren\u2019t many neighbors to complain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety about income inequality and class warfare, and a lot of these artists are trying to do the best they can to have a community.\u201dMr. Aguilar-Canabal has been to the Ghost Ship once, last summer, and remembered it as a dim and cluttered area with a \u201cmaze\u201d of furniture, canvas paintings on the walls and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hanging from the ceilings.\u201cThe reason we left was that it had only had one source of water, which was a sink, and the water tasted really gross,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe went to a corner store to get something to drink and were like, \u2018Let\u2019s just go home.\u2019\u201dMr. Aguilar-Canabal flew to Vancouver early Saturday morning, and first read about the blaze on Twitter. Instead of going to bed, he stayed up tracking the fire on social media until it was time to go to the airport. He spent most of the day looking for the names of friends who he thinks were killed, and calling Highland Hospital in Oakland.\u201cIt\u2019s just a really surreal experience to be refreshing a window to see if names are confirmed to be missing or not missing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m keeping track of a couple names and hoping they end up being in a hospital.\u201dAn article on Sunday about a deadly warehouse fire in Oakland, Calif., misidentified the location in Rhode Island of a 2003 nightclub fire that killed 100 people. It was in West Warwick, not in Warwick.Thomas Fuller and Conor Dougherty reported from Oakland, and Eli Rosenberg from New York.

She had already heard that her home had burned down, but she wanted to see it for herself. Her friend Sherry Angel, 44, was in the passenger seat. Ms. Angel had heard that her aunt had died in the blaze, though other family members said Friday that the woman was only missing.The line of cars crept toward town. \u201cWhat happens now,\u201d Ms. Gauvreau said, \u201cis that we just pick up our pieces and move on.\u201dThere were moments this week in Gatlinburg when crying seemed like the only reasonable response. The police chief choked back tears at a news conference. Katrina Bogle, 41, a worker at a Subway restaurant near the perimeter of the evacuation zone, cried Friday while assembling a sandwich.\u201cThis is incredible, what Jesus is doing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.By Friday, the dawning scope of the economic damage had begun to mingle with the more pressing grief and shock. Rumors of the victims\u2019 identities trickled through the emergency shelters; the authorities had only publicly named five of them as of Friday afternoon. Survivors traded their stories of narrow escape through the smoke and racing flames Monday night. But many had also begun to wonder what they would do next.\u201cIf the tourists don\u2019t come back, there\u2019s no work,\u201d Silvestre Trinidad, 25, a restaurant employee, said in Spanish as he waited around with a large group of men who shared similar stories at the Rocky Top Sports World, a big athletic complex that turned into the main shelter.The return procession to Gatlinburg Friday was only temporary: Residents, and even tourists, who had been forced to leave town at a moment\u2019s notice, were given little time to assess, grab essentials and leave. The mayor of Sevier County, Larry Waters, said that the city would not be open to the public until Wednesday at the latest.A number of the burned buildings were vacation rentals. But a bigger worry was the international news of the disaster, and the fact that it was difficult to discern, from a distance, what had not been ruined. Mark Adams, the chief executive and president of the Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce, posted a video on Facebook showing off the relatively unmolested main commercial strip.\u201cEverything is here,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the shops that you\u2019re accustomed to seeing here.\u201dBut some were hesitant to visit what they thought might be a disaster zone. The problem was even afflicting Pigeon Forge, which was largely unscathed. Kelly Johnson and her family operate a number of restaurants in the area. One of them, a Gatlinburg steak house, burned down. But she said that big parties \u2014 family reunions and rehearsal dinners \u2014 had been canceling at her Pigeon Forge business.\u201cIt did not burn the city to the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if people think that happened, we are in big, big trouble.\u201dDavid Fee, president of the company that owns the 800-seat Hatfield & McCoy Dinner Show, said the fire had cost the company at least $300,000 in the past three days. That included some 2,000 donated meals and lost ticket revenues, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lay anybody off as long as we\u2019re able,\u201d he said. But, \u201ca quarter of a million dollars in three days is nothing you can sustain for long.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s got a big heart, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d she said.Those close family and community ties remain in Sevier County, even as Dollywood has given the place a corporate makeover, and people were relying on them heavily this week. Ms. Gauvreau, a rental property manager, drove into town past burned-out buildings next to perfectly fine ones: the fire, it seemed, had hopscotched around erratically.She teared up at the sight of her house. She looked for a cat but had no luck. Then she screwed up some courage and drove on through the half-charred ghost town to survey the properties she is charged with overseeing.\u201cMy heart is not hurting because of me,\u201d she had said earlier. \u201cI\u2019m hurting for the tenants of mine that I saw every day.\u201dJohn Jeter contributed reporting from Greenville, S.C.Advertisement"}

But one day she turned to me and said, \u201cI hate reading.\u201dI put the assignment aside.That was my abrupt introduction to the debate over homework that is bubbling up as students across the United States head back to school.This month, Brandy Young, a second-grade teacher in Godley, Tex., let parents know on \u201cMeet the Teacher\u201d night that she had no plans to load up her students\u2019 backpacks.\u201cThere will be no formally assigned homework this year,\u201d Ms. Young wrote in a note that was widely shared on Facebook. \u201cRather, I ask that you spend your evenings doing things that are proven to correlate with student success. Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside, and get your child to bed early.\u201dOther conversations about homework are humming in town halls and online. Some school districts, including one near Phoenix, have taken steps to shorten the summer break, out of concern that too much is forgotten over the summer.

{"Headline": "For Fact-Checking Website Snopes, a Bigger Role Brings More Attacks", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 The last line of defense against the torrent of half-truths, untruths and outright fakery that make up so much of the modern internet is in a downscale strip mall near the beach.Snopes, the fact-checking website, does not have an office designed to impress, or even be noticed. A big sign outside still bears the name of the previous tenant, a maker of underwater headphones. Inside there\u2019s nothing much \u2014 a bunch of improvised desks, a table tennis table, cartons of Popchips and cases of Dr Pepper. It looks like a dot-com on the way to nowhere.Appearances deceive. This is where the muddled masses come by the virtual millions to establish just what the heck is really going on in a world turned upside down.All untrue, except for the demise of Mr. Thicke, which was easily verifiable.\u201cRationality seems to have fallen out of vogue,\u201d said Brooke Binkowski, Snopes\u2019s managing editor. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. Everything is really strange right now.\u201dOne way to chart Snopes\u2019s increasing prominence is by measuring the rise in fake news about the site itself. If you believe the internet, the founder of Snopes, David Mikkelson, has a longer rap sheet than Al Capone. He was supposedly arrested for committing fraud and corruption and running a pit bull ring. In the wake of a deal that Snopes and others made this month to start fact-checking for Facebook, new slurs and allegations poured forth.The underlying message of these spurious attacks is that the movement to fact-check the internet is a left-wing conspiracy whose real goal is to censor the right, and therefore must be resisted at all costs.\u201cSmearing people just because you don\u2019t like what they\u2019re saying often works to shut them up,\u201d Ms. Binkowski, 39, said. \u201cBut at Snopes you learn to grow a thick skin. I will always push back. At least until someone shows up at my workplace and kills me.\u201dMr. Mikkelson, a former computer programmer, met his first wife, Barbara, in a folklore discussion group on the internet. They called their website Snopes in tribute to the venal family in William Faulkner\u2019s novels.Their first group of posts, back in 1995, tackled questions about Disneyland, such as whether there really was a secret restaurant at the park. (There was.) It was a time when the nascent web was seen as a force that would deliver enlightenment and truth to all.Starting about two years ago, Snopes made an effort to professionalize itself. It added a dozen staff members just in time to become the go-to debunking site for an election full of venom. The number of unique users jumped 42 percent over 2015, peaking at nearly 2.5 million the day after the election.Just about everyone at Snopes thought things would calm down after the votes were in. \u201cThe fake news wasn\u2019t from Trump so much. It was from people who hated Hillary Clinton,\u201d Ms. Binkowski said. \u201cOnce the election was over we figured it would go away.\u201dShe scheduled a vacation, and thought she would spend more time writing about such things as how no one has a water bed anymore. Mr. Mikkelson, 56, went on a lengthy honeymoon in Japan and China.But the role of fake news and misinformation in Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise win quickly reached a fever pitch, prompting questions about the extent to which Facebook, where many of these bogus stories were shared, had influenced the election. Reluctantly, the social media giant was forced to act.Mr. Mikkelson, speaking from Washington State, declined to claim this new initiative was a potential turning point in the quest for truth on the internet, or even in the history of Snopes.\u201cI said, \u2018O.K., we\u2019ll give it a try,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really involve us doing anything we wouldn\u2019t already be doing.\u201d As for Facebook, he thinks it had to do something but had few good options. Blocking content outright, for instance, would be a public relations minefield.Even when he is in this country, Mr. Mikkelson is a bit elusive. His voice mail box is full, but he is in no hurry to clear it out. In the wake of a contentious divorce from Barbara, he now owns half of Snopes. The other half is owned by the principals of Proper Media, a digital media firm.All of Snopes\u2019s revenue \u2014 Mr. Mikkelson says he doesn\u2019t know what it is \u2014 come from ads. Facebook is not paying for its services. Nor is the billionaire George Soros funding the site, although that is sometimes asserted in anti-Snopes stories.Mr. Mikkelson seems more amused than outraged by the spectacle that is the internet, even when it takes aim at him.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any inflated sense of self-importance at Snopes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are always telling us, \u2018You\u2019re deviating from your mission.\u2019 My response is: \u2018We don\u2019t have a mission. We just do what we do.\u2019\u201d But he conceded that something had gone wrong with the early utopian dreams for the internet.\u201cMaking everyone equal as an information source doesn\u2019t work very well in practice,\u201d he said. Then he laughed, something he does frequently.Ms. Binkowski, a former radio reporter who still freelances about border issues, thinks there is a mission.\u201cNot to be ideological or Pollyannaish, but you have to believe this work makes a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019d just go back to bed and drink.\u201d Although there are other benefits to working at Snopes: \u201cI really like telling people they\u2019re wrong. \u201dThe Snopes writers generally take a long-term perspective on fake news. The practice itself they see as ancient. The difference now is that the stories circulate faster and people can make money spreading them, which gives its purveyors a whole new motivation.There is also a cultural shift, said Kim LaCapria, who lives on Long Island and writes many of the Snopes political posts.\u201cIt used to be that if you got too far from the mainstream, you were shunned for being a little nutty,\u201d she said. \u201cNow there is so much nutty going around that it\u2019s socially acceptable to embrace wild accusations. No one is embarrassed by anything anymore.\u201dThe remedy, she and Ms. Binkowski feel, is more traditional journalism.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t necessarily getting the media literacy they need, so they\u2019re just kind of panicking,\u201d Ms. LaCapria said.\u201cPeople think the death of a 69-year-old from a heart attack must be a hoax. That is how muddy the waters are now,\u201d Ms. LaCapria said. \u201cThey are afraid, even with such an easily verifiable thing, to trust anyone.\u201dBut there are also those who trust too much, and they are a much larger group. The bios at the end of posts on Snopes are often whimsical, so Ms. LaCapria wrote that she got her job \u201cdue to an executive order unilaterally passed by President Obama during a secret, late-night session.\u201dA joke \u2014 but her own mother took it at face value. \u201cYou\u2019ve known me for 36 years. Of course it\u2019s not true!\u201d Ms. LaCapria told her. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for us to be tricked, all of us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "In the 1936 film \u201cShow Boat,\u201d Paul Robeson, in a brilliant and moving performance as the stevedore Joe, sings \u201cOl\u2019 Man River.\u201d The scene is melancholic, even tragic, as Robeson contrasts the hardships of his menial labor with the effortless flow of the Mississippi River. The actor\u2019s expression hints at weariness and sadness, that \u201cuneasily tied knot of pain and hope,\u201d as the writer Richard Wright described it, which often registered on the faces of marginalized African-American entertainers of the time.Robeson was a Renaissance man: a star varsity football player, valedictorian of his 1919 graduating class at Rutgers College, an unwavering activist for civil rights who received a law degree from Columbia University, and a classically trained actor and singer. Yet in 1930s Hollywood, roles for black actors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even ones as accomplished as Robeson \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were limited to playing subservient characters at best.\u201cWhen I started the Vintage Black Glamour blog in 2011, I had only the women\u2019s book in mind but, as time went on, it became increasingly obvious that a men\u2019s edition would be in order,\u201d Ms. Gainer wrote. \u201cMany of the men in this book can be found in historic accounts of various sports, music, or Black Hollywood, however, my goal here is to present familiar figures in a new light, and take lesser known figures beyond being more than an historical footnote.\u201dAs a result, each photograph is accompanied by a short biographical essay that illuminates the subject\u2019s contributions to society and culture. As with her earlier book, Ms. Gainer tracks the paths of professional success and the construction of public image. She explores how prominent black men shaped their image through personal style and demeanor, insisting on taking charge of how they were seen to get around the limiting stereotypes that defined them.Historically, the problem of black male representation has been deep and pervasive, from outright negative stereotypes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 lumbering servants, criminals and buffoons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to more subtle, but no less damaging, slights. Harry Belafonte, for example, noted the inferior scripts he was offered in the 1950s and 1960s: \u201cIn every one of them, the black male lead was neutered. Judging by those roles, you would wonder if black men even knew what it meant to fall in love, much less to have sex.\u201dA continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.The achievements of black men were often viewed differently from those of their white counterparts. They were typically \u201cdamned with the faint praise of having \u2018natural skills,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u201d Ms. Gainer wrote, their talent borne of innate physical prowess that did not involve learning, virtuosity, or hard work.Invisibility was also an impediment for these men. Routinely covered by the African-American press, they were alternately dismissed or ignored by the white media. In the book, Ms. Gainer recounts an infamous incident in which Time magazine, for a 1954 cover story on jazz, interviewed Duke Ellington and Dave Brubeck but included only a picture of Brubeck, who was white, on its cover.The book\u2019s many images represent men at the epitome of success and glamour: Richard Wright, cigarette in hand, dressed in a crisp white suit; a pensive James Earl Jones, hands gracefully folded over the back of a chair; the suave singer Nat King Cole, standing on a pier, the wind ruffling his stylish raincoat; Harold Jackman, the debonair founder of the Harlem Experimental Theater; the nattily dressed Louisiana governor, Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback, who served briefly during the period of Reconstruction; and Cab Calloway in top hat and tails.The photographs of these men, and the many others included in \u201cVintage Black Glamour,\u201d served as alternative icons, replacing defamatory or mollifying character types with images that exemplified what it meant to be talented, hard-working, self-possessed and, to employ a word that has itself become a kind of stereotype, cool. But as the cultural critic Bell Hooks observed, for African-American men, being cool was not a shallow sensibility. It was a means of survival and self-preservation.\u201cOnce upon a time black male \u2018cool\u2019 was defined by the ways in which black men confronted the hardships of life without allowing their spirits to be ravaged,\u201d Ms. Hooks wrote. \u201cIt was defined by black male willingness to confront reality, to face the truth, and bear it not by adopting a false pose of cool while feeding on fantasy; not by black male denial or by assuming a \u2018poor me\u2019 victim identity. It was defined by individual black males daring to self-define rather than be defined by others.\u201dMs. Gainer\u2019s book uses compelling photographs and texts to vividly document the myriad ways black men accomplished this goal as well as the important contributions they have made to black culture and society in general.\u201cI want people to see these pictures and go and listen to their music, read their books, and watch their films,\u201d Ms. Gainer wrote in the book\u2019s afterword. \u201cMy hope is that by telling the stories of these men, people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially other artists and entrepreneurs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will learn about the innovations and sacrifices that went into the things that we often take for granted today, and draw inspiration from it.\u201dMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

He lived in a steel mill town, where he raised rows of tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, cranberries and cherries, which Ms. Moldovan would eat directly from the trees. While her grandfather, Ion Ciugudean, did not talk much about his work as a radiologist, he did seem to know everyone in the village. Whenever he would go to the market, shopkeepers and customers would say hello and treat him with the same respect he treated his patients. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved him the most,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Moldovan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a small child, I spent a lot of time with him. We were both crying whenever I had to come back to Bucharest.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSixteen years after her grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, Romania is no longer under Communist rule and his town has taken on a post-industrial disposition.  Ms. Moldovan, 36, is now returning to her childhood memories for a project about rural Romanian doctors. And though the project stems from her heart, it is not shy of social significance. Ms. Moldovan has been following Dr. Floarea Ciupitu, a family doctor who cares for about 1,700 patients in G\u00c3\u00a2ngiova, a commune in southwestern Romania.  Dr. Ciupitu has been working there for about 30 years, with only a single nurse to assist her. For her, the work is more of a calling than a career.On weekdays, Dr. Ciupitu, 61, stays in G\u00c3\u00a2ngiova sleeping on an old hospital bed in a tiny room above her practice, occasionally watching television. On weekends, she goes home to her family about 40 miles north, in Craiova.   Entering Dr. Ciupitu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, Ms. Moldovan was transported to another era. Antique scales, paper medical records stacked on an old wooden filing cabinet and white ceramic water pitchers glistened against the light through sheer, lace curtains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought it would be a little bit more evolved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Moldovan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 and we are a European Union country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trained doctors, especially younger ones, have been fleeing the country and, according to the Romanian Health Ministry, there is a severe doctor shortage.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if they stay, a lot of doctors prefer working in urban areas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Moldovan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalf the population lives in a rural area, but they have half the number of doctors compared to urban areas, so they are outnumbered two to one.\u00e2\u0080\u009dUnlike hospital doctors, family doctors are self-employed, but they are the gateway to the public health system. This means those on welfare cannot access free services without a general practitioner unless they enroll in private health care. But instead of exposing a system with flaws, Ms. Moldovan decided to shadow a family doctor to show young medical graduates a positive example of health care, so they might reconsider before leaving the country. She also wanted to challenge stereotypes about the Romanian system. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to talk about the problems in the health care system in Romania, but at the same time I wanted to do it by showing a good example of a doctor that is involved in the community.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo while younger doctors continue to flee Romania, chasing higher pay in other European Union member states, Ms. Moldovan hopes to remind them of the difference between a calling and a career. Dr. Ciupitu is just that example. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone says hello when she passes on the street,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Moldovan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of a local hero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "He knew the rhythms of their lives from the time he arrived there as a student, when there were about 30 nuns who worked at the hospital\u2019s various wards and lived in an adjoining convent. Today, five are left, the result of changes in health care and a decline in the numbers of women entering the religious life.Yet the photographs that Mr. Fiechter has produced are not lonely or sad, but filled with a certain warmth, tenderness and, at times, even humor. Those who do not know the lives of nuns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who have long done important, if overlooked work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 might be surprised. But these images highlight a certain joy that carried these women through the day, despite the obvious challenges and dwindling of their ranks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPatients come and go, but these women have always been there for decades,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Fiechter, 36, who was also born at the hospital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked in different hospital, huge university hospitals without nuns. In this hospital, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a special spirit. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if you\u2019re Christian or not, these nuns make it familiar. It\u2019s not like an institution. They are always there, like a family, they live there and are always around.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTheir approach, he said, was total.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have a high medical standard, but also a high standard about how you treat the patient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treat the illness, you treat the person, the medical issue and the psychological situation. Everything has to be taken care of together.Mr. Fiechter, whose parents still live in L\u00c3\u00b6rrach, said the hospital is more than 100 years old, and started out as a military hospital. Nuns began staffing it in the following years, and at one point numbered about 100. They established a nursing school in 1964, in which Mr. Leichter enrolled in 1998. When he switched to studying photojournalism, he returned to the hospital for a class assignment on Christmas. He returned a few years later when he was invited to do a project on his hometown.He wanted to look at not so much their work, but their lives, which is why you will not see many pictures of them working with patients in the wards. The hospital itself has shrunk over the years: as adult patients go to a government hospital in the region, St. Elisabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s has become primarily a pediatric institution. The staff is primarily lay people now.The few nuns who still live there \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most retired and volunteering \u00e2\u0080\u0094 take a special joy in their routine. Some tend to taking care of the chapel, restocking supplies in patient rooms or visiting patients. The leader of the community, Sister Anemunda, juggles several responsibilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is talking to the patients and the families, helping them through their morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fiechter said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a child is dying she is to pray and support them. She is the connection for the families. They can always call her, even when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in the hospital anymore.  She is still, walking around the hospital every day, at every ward, asking the staff if they need or a patient needs help, to talk, or support.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt would be wrong, he said, to think the women were hiding from the world. He found them to be engaged with the town around them, as well as issues in contemporary Germany, like the refugee issues that have confronted the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe say they do not live in a closed monastery with walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir profession is to serve God through their work with the people. I was very surprised because I spent many days with them, I heard them talking about the world, politics and all issues. I was really surprised how open and modern they are in their way of thinking. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect someone who was 85 would be so up to date on politics and liberal in their way of thinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Prayer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 five times a day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is central to their routine, which begins at 5 a.m. But when they are not working or worshiping they go visit friends and family, go for walks or window shop.Time was when the older nuns would retire and remain at the convent. Nowadays, those who leave are sent to a retirement facility that is home to dozens of retired sisters. And Mr. Fiechter has little doubt what will happen once the five nuns at the hospital decide to leave.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a matter of time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fiechter said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce the last nun dies or moves out, I think it will be closed. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I wanted to follow them. In ten years, people can forget about this generation. For me that is the main issue, so people will remember.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "In Washington Pizzeria Attack, Fake News Brought Real Guns", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Edgar M. Welch, a 28-year-old father of two from Salisbury, N.C., recently read online that Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in northwest Washington, was harboring young children as sex slaves as part of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton.In an arraignment on Monday, a heavily tattooed Mr. Welch, wearing a white jumpsuit and shackles, was ordered held. According to the criminal complaint, he told the authorities that he was armed to help rescue children but that he surrendered peacefully after finding no evidence that \u201cchildren were being harbored in the restaurant.\u201d He was charged with four counts, including felony assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a gun without a license outside a home or business.Unbeknown to Mr. Welch, what he had been reading online were fake news articles about Comet Ping Pong, which have swollen in number over time. The false articles against the pizzeria began appearing on social networks and websites in late October, not long before the presidential election, with the restaurant identified as being the headquarters for a child-trafficking ring.Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have been flooded with more attacks against the pizzeria as believers in the child-trafficking conspiracy became more zealous. Within hours of the publication of one of the debunking articles, a post on Twitter by Representative Steven Smith of the 15th District of Georgia \u2014 not a real lawmaker and not a real district \u2014 warned that what was fake was the information being peddled by the mainstream media. It was retweeted dozens of times.On YouTube, a step-by-step takedown of the Times article was viewed nearly 250,000 times and passed around on Twitter and Facebook. A surge of new fake articles amplified the original pieces, now linking the child-abuse ring \u2014 known as Pizzagate \u2014 to a global pedophilia ring reaching Britain.\u201cWe should all condemn the efforts of certain people to spread malicious and utterly false accusations about Comet Ping Pong,\u201d James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, said in a statement on Sunday. Mr. Alefantis, who has repeatedly refuted the fake news articles, has closed the pizzeria for a few days. He has prominent Democratic friends and previously communicated with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, which he has said may have made him a target.The shooting underscores the stubborn lasting power of fake news and how hard it is to stamp out. Debunking false news articles can sometimes stoke the outrage of the believers, leading fake news purveyors to feed that appetite with more misinformation. Efforts by social media companies to control the spread of these stories are limited, and shutting one online discussion thread down simply pushes the fake news creators to move to another space online.\u201cThe reason why it\u2019s so hard to stop fake news is that the facts don\u2019t change people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Leslie Harris, a former president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that promotes free speech and open internet policies. When users are caught abusing the terms of one media platform, they simply go to another, she said.The criminal complaint filed on Monday in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia charged Edgar M. Welch with firing a semi-automatic assault rifle inside Comet Ping Pong, a restaurant that had been the center of a fake news story involving Hillary Clinton.The viral nature of the misinformation was illustrated again late Sunday, not long after the police arrested Mr. Welch and called Pizzagate a \u201cfictitious online conspiracy theory\u201d in their report. Some individuals on Twitter said Mr. Welch was an actor used by the mainstream media to divert attention from the alleged crimes at Comet Ping Pong. Followers of a shuttered Reddit thread on Pizzagate dissected the episode on a new online network called Voat.The storm of fake news has swept up not only Comet Ping Pong, but its neighboring businesses. Conspiracy theorists have linked symbols that some local businesses on the same street as Comet Ping Pong used in their logos to symbols of pedophilia code.At Terasol, a French restaurant across the street from Comet Ping Pong, the owner, Sabrina Ousmaal, said she received daily phone threats and her business\u2019s Facebook page had been filled with false accusations, including, \u201cYou guys mind explaining the pedophilia symbol removed from your website then?\u201d She added that the symbol was not on her restaurant but on the store of a nearby shop and was a swirl within a triangle.Ms. Ousmaal said she and her husband had called the police and the F.B.I. but had received little guidance. \u201cI am appalled and horrified,\u201d Ms. Ousmaal said of the shooting on Sunday. \u201cNothing has been done. This is not free speech. This is a hate crime.\u201d\u201cMany of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley didn\u2019t develop this technology to make it easier for hate to be propagated online; their idea was to build a community where people could more effectively communicate and engage in commerce,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cIf you do administer a platform that is used extensively to propagate hate and to inspire acts of violence, well, I think most people are going to be less likely to use the platform.\u201dFor purveyors of fake news who have continued pushing the Pizzagate theory even after the facts have been debunked, whether Comet Ping Pong is even engaged in a pedophilia ring is beyond the point. Jeffrey Marty, a lawyer from Florida, said in a phone interview that he was the man posing as Representative Steven Smith from Georgia\u2019s fictional 15th District. He said that he was frustrated with the way the mainstream media covered the election and that he believes that most of his 24,000 followers know that his account is a parody.Mr. Marty, who has tweeted links to fake news stories and repeatedly said the mainstream media needs to investigate Pizzagate, declined to say whether he actually believed the Comet Ping Pong allegations. \u201cI just think you need to investigate. There are clues everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t agree with what happened at the restaurant.\u201dMr. Welch has long supported family values, his friends said Monday. He briefly volunteered at the Locke Township Fire Department in Salisbury, according to the chief, Rusty Alexander. Friends described Mr. Welch as a doting father who loved the outdoors. While he had been arrested while driving impaired in 2013 and was sentenced to probation, the shooting on Sunday was out of character, his friends said.\u201cThat\u2019s not at all the person I know,\u201d Louis Bodak, whose son Matthew is a good friend of Mr. Welch\u2019s, said about the shooting.Mr. Welch is scheduled to appear in court again on Thursday.Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a fake news article that led to a shooting at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., misspelled, in some copies, the given name of the Florida lawyer who complained about the media. He is Jeffrey Marty, not Jeffery.Ken Otterbourg contributed reporting from Salisbury, N.C., and Gardiner Harris from Washington. Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons From the Media\u2019s Failures in Its Year With Trump", "Date": "2016-12-31", "News": "Supported byThe last year has not been the news media\u2019s finest.Despite some outstanding coverage, over all we misled many people into thinking that Donald Trump would never win the Republican nomination, let alone the White House. Too often we followed what glittered, yapped uselessly at everything in sight and didn\u2019t dig hard enough or hold politicians accountable for lies.In 2008, the three broadcast networks, in their nightly news programs, devoted over the entire year a total of three hours and 40 minutes to issues reporting (defined as independent coverage of election issues, not arising from candidate statements or debates). In 2016, that plummeted to a grand total of just 36 minutes.ABC and NBC had just nine minutes of issues coverage each; CBS had 18 minutes. So ABC and NBC each had less than one minute of issues coverage per month in 2016.Those figures come from Andrew Tyndall, whose Tyndall Report monitors the news programs. By Tyndall\u2019s measures, there was zero independent coverage in 2016 on those nightly programs about poverty, climate change or drug addiction.\u201cJournalists were confronted with the spectacle of an issues-free campaign,\u201d Tyndall told me. \u201cThey had to decide how to react: with complicity, since such tactics were easy to shoehorn into the ratings-pleasing entertainment structure of a reality TV show, or with defiance, by delving into what was at stake.\u201dThey chose the former, he says, and \u201ctreated their viewers not as citizens, but as so many pairs of eyeballs.\u201dThe entire media world needs new revenue sources \u2014 including philanthropy \u2014 to finance coverage that is important but unprofitable.Still, many of us chose journalism because we believed it to be a public good. I\u2019ve seen journalists abroad risk their lives to get a story because they believed it important. If they can do that, maybe executive producers can occasionally risk ratings?It didn\u2019t help that the national media isn\u2019t very diverse \u2014 not just in racial or ethnic terms, but also socioeconomically and geographically. We don\u2019t have many national journalists with working-class or evangelical roots, so our coverage of Trump voters was often shallow or condescending, and we largely missed the fury and despair that Trump rode to victory.We\u2019ll have to be persistent, continuing to press for the release of taxes and for policy details. We\u2019ll have to avoid the perils of false equivalence, quoting a person on each side as if there\u2019s a genuine debate when we know there isn\u2019t. And this may sound odd for a columnist to say, but we need more reporting, less pontificating.When so many Americans believe false claims, we should weigh in aggressively on the side of truth.Would it matter if the mainstream media did a better job? Or do we live in a post-truth age in which we are so distrusted that our investigations will be dismissed, if they are seen at all? I\u2019m not sure, but we must at least try.We will soon have as commander in chief the most evasive, ignorant and puerile national politician I\u2019ve ever met, and while there are many factors behind his election, I think we in the media contributed by skimping on due diligence.The lesson learned? As 2017 dawns, let\u2019s focus on what matters. Not celebrity, but substance: Will millions of Americans lose health insurance? What will happen to the 21 percent of American children living in poverty? Will Syrians be endlessly slaughtered, and will South Sudan collapse into genocide? Will there be a trade war? A real war?For too much of 2016, we in the news media \u2014 with many stellar exceptions \u2014 sometimes were mindless mutts that barked at everything. Partly because of that lapse, the country today needs a robust fourth estate more than ever. We should be infused with a renewed sense of mission. So, for a New Year\u2019s resolution, let\u2019s try harder to be watchdogs, not lap dogs.Advertisement"}

A racist caricature of Japan? Some amalgam of the two? Recent revivals have ended up in the cross hairs of these questions, sparking protests across the nation, along with earnest wondering about how \u2014 and even if \u2014 this 1885 piece should be staged in the 21st century.Finding the right balance is not easy: Some of the most severe critics of \u201cThe Mikado\u201d find it too inherently offensive to be performed, while some ardent fans view any changes as bows to excessive political correctness. Shortly after the New York company announced it was replacing last year\u2019s \u201cMikado\u201d with \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance,\u201d David Wannen, its executive director, received a letter from a self-described pirate who complained that he was offended that the troupe did not plan to cast real pirates.David Auxier, the director of the new \u201cMikado\u201d production, recalled that \u201cSometimes the conversation got to be: \u2018You\u2019re never going to please everybody, so why try?\u2019\u201dHe added: \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re starting from the understanding that we\u2019re never going to please everybody. But we\u2019re still going to try.\u2019\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Lee questioned the commonly heard defense that \u201cThe Mikado\u201d should not be considered racist because it is meant in fun. \u201cThere are lots of instances in blackface minstrelsy that are lighthearted and funny \u2014 and also offensive,\u201d she said.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do a lot of violence to the work to not tape actor\u2019s eyes back to make their eyes look \u2018slanty,\u2019\u201d he said, recalling productions he had appeared in that did just that.The production will emphasize the work\u2019s satire of Victorian mores, and do away with racially charged performance tics and excessive bowing and shuffling in its choreography. While the ensemble would never be mistaken for, say, the multicultural cast of \u201cHamilton,\u201d it is the troupe\u2019s most diverse yet.\u201cAm I glad this conversation is happening?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbsolutely. Do I wish this conversation had been 20 years ago? Of course.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He headed straight for the nearest Petland.He picked up 10 crickets, 10 waxworms, 13 tobacco hornworms and 15 darkling beetle larvae, known as superworms.The next day, just before Christmas, Mr. Rodriques, 26, sat in his childhood bedroom, surrounded by glass tanks, and reflected on his metamorphosis from isolated bug nerd to minicelebrity and fledgling ambassador for the creepy and crawly, performing regular show-and-tells at art spaces and schools.\u201cEvery major event in my life,\u201d he said, \u201chas been around insects.\u201dMr. Rodriques sat at his childhood desk with a wide horn hissing cockroach crawling across the front of his shirt and a death\u2019s head cockroach, momentarily forgotten, somewhere on his back. The wide horn is three and a half inches long, with a lustrous, lacquered-wood-looking exoskeleton that appears to be wearing an oversized black frog mask. The bulging \u201ceyes\u201d are his horns. He said he used them \u201csort of like a ram would use its horns\u201d to fight other males over territory. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot more mammalian than we give them credit for.\u201dAt a visitor\u2019s request, Mr. Rodriques took out a few tobacco hornworms \u2014 gaudy, gorgeous, ridiculous creatures, turquoise and green with false eyes along their bodies and false horns on their rear ends. In pet stores, they are sold as food for leopard geckos. \u201cI feel like these are too precious to keep as feeders,\u201d he said. He has a leopard gecko, but feeds it only crickets and waxworms.Mr. Rodriques wrote his master\u2019s thesis at New York University about hornworms. \u201cThey have an amazing defense where they collect the nicotine found in the tobacco they eat and exhale it as a gas to scare away predators.\u201d But they are also his friends. \u201cIf I\u2019m feeling stressed out, I might take one out and they\u2019ll calm me down,\u201d he said.A gentle, quiet man with a bushy Afro, Mr. Rodriques marks his life by the bugs he has loved. When he was 4, he would scoop up pavement ants in front of his house and keep them in jars. \u201cThey looked like a weird combination of robots and aliens,\u201d he said.When he was 6, his family moved to their current home, on a cul-de-sac near the end of the 5 train. Its modest backyard contained a wealth of beetles. \u201cI was on beetles for a long time,\u201d Mr. Rodriques said.

And Mr. Rodriques believes they can help fight xenophobia. \u201cWhen you change your thought process from seeing something and being afraid of it, to seeing it and not knowing what it is and then learning more about it, that spills over into other avenues,\u201d he said.On Monday, Mr. Rodriques will head back to Purdue University to resume his doctoral research on the seductively sweet tergal secretions of German cockroaches. (\u201cThe male secretes it, she eats it, and while she eats it, he\u2019ll mate with her.\u201d)Eventually, he hopes to conduct research on the lesser marsh grasshopper, which lives near Chernobyl and seems to thrive on radiation. Learning why, he said, could lead to medicines to ease the side effects of chemotherapy.He has other goals, too.\u201cI would also like to make giant insects,\u201d he said.

It mobilized its technology for his defeat and warned of dire consequences if he should somehow win.Now that the impossible has happened, tech\u2019s day of reckoning is here \u2014 next Wednesday afternoon, to be precise. The president-elect is summoning leaders of the biggest tech companies to New York for a round-table discussion, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The agenda is undisclosed and perhaps still under consideration, but it is unlikely to produce the sort of love fest that existed between President Obama and Silicon Valley. Tech culture celebrates disruption as the tool that produces a better future for all. Many of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters, on the other hand, see it as pushing them down.Two Silicon Valley chief executives appeared willing to test the waters: Safra Catz, of the software maker Oracle, confirmed her participation in next week\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump. So did Chuck Robbins of Cisco Systems, the networking gear maker.Representatives for other leading tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple, declined to comment. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel has said in interviews that the benefits accruing to tech investors like himself should be more widely shared outside a few ZIP codes in New York and around San Francisco. One role of the meeting is to spur ideas for changing this situation. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment.In Apple\u2019s case, Mr. Trump has said he told its chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, in late November that he wants the company to build \u201ca big plant\u201d in the United States \u2014 or even better, \u201cmany big plants.\u201dApple itself does not do any manufacturing in the United States. A contractor, Flex, manufactures high-end desktop computers on its behalf in Austin, Tex., employing about 2,000 people. A vast majority of Apple\u2019s production is in China, where there is an enormous ecosystem devoted to it. Many economists say that reproducing such an interlocking web of suppliers here would push the cost of iPhones up considerably.Mr. Trump also tangled with Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, during the campaign, saying that Mr. Bezos has \u201ca huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dIf there are some overtures being made in Silicon Valley, there are also some lines being drawn.Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week\u2019s meeting: defiance.\u201cIf an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company\u2019s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him,\u201d Mr. Sacca said.Or perhaps everyone will get along fine. Some in Silicon Valley speculate that the rough moments between Mr. Trump and the tech industry come not because they are so different but because they are at the bottom so similar.\u201cTrump embodies the harsher aspects of Silicon Valley \u2014 a brash and arrogant disrupter, convinced that the world is all wrong as it is and only he can change it for the better,\u201d said Shiva Ramesh, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious-yet-vague plans have a familiar ring. \u201cSounds like the pitch of some start-ups: \u2018It is all there in my head and in a one-page plan, it will all work out, I can do it, trust me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.Advertisement"}

(The tally had hit 42,000 by Sunday.)As Mr. Trump tries to burn the media village down, he may just be saving it.His running campaign of Twitter attacks, declarations of failure and vows to punish the traditional news media is threatening to do what so many years of cost-cutting and re-envisioning could not do as easily: put the industry on more solid economic footing, where customers who realize its value are willing to pay for it more regularly.It\u2019s early. And, in traditional media, hope is the province of masochists.It\u2019s as if Mr. Trump\u2019s media attacks have combined with the heightened attention on the perils of fake news to create one big fat advertisement for the value of basic journalism.\u201cThe fake news business is going to be great for journalism in the long run,\u201d Mr. Carter told me Friday, referring to Mr. Trump as \u201cthe Fake Newser in Chief.\u201d \u201cProper news organizations should thrive under this.\u201dTo do so, though, journalism is going to have to find its inner Taylor Swift.The music industry might seem like an odd place for people in the hard news game to turn. But, like the news industry, it had spent the better part of this century preparing its obituary as the web made it easy for people to listen to so much music without paying for it.Now, think of the readers as Apple in the showdown with Ms. Swift. In many cases, they\u2019ve been getting news for free that other people pay for through subscriptions. That is because newspapers for so long gave it all away for nothing, only to face dire economic consequences when players like Facebook and Google showed up to gobble up the online advertising market. That put the onus back onto selling subscriptions.As the country and the world head into this confusing new era, news organizations are in a position to make a newly urgent pitch: Buying a subscription is tantamount to supporting the pillars of democracy. It\u2019s about maintaining the sort of reporting that debunks fake news, holds power accountable and keeps the nation on course in its own imperfect way.Real reporting costs real money. But newsrooms, saddled with big losses in advertising revenue, are continuing to contract, even with huge online circulation gains.Now comes an openly press-hostile new president who is entering office not only attacking the news media publicly on Twitter but signaling that he may fundamentally alter the way the executive branch views its obligations to the press.It would be spilled milk to most Americans, who probably don\u2019t care which reporter sits where. But the symbolism is important. Since the early 1980s, successive Republican and Democratic administrations have left seating assignments to the White House Correspondents Association because they were \u201cmindful of the potential appearance of playing favorites if they assigned the seats themselves,\u201d as Jeff Mason, the association president, said last week.One candidate for the press secretary job, the chief Republican Party spokesman, Sean Spicer, told Megyn Kelly of Fox News last week that Mr. Trump would not shut reporters out. But he did say a Trump White House might move away from having daily press briefings.If it does so that would be part of a trend in which politicians and others in power try to push traditionally trained reporters out of the way.Just look at the way Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is supporting a fast-tracked and bipartisan bill that would economically devastate newspapers in the state by ending the legal requirement that state and local agencies place their legal notices in print papers.Good reporters know how to get past politicians\u2019 information blockades. But it can take resources.That\u2019s where the new subscriptions come in. If they keep growing \u2014 sure, a big if \u2014 they could bring what The Los Angeles Times\u2019s editor in chief and publisher, Davan Maharaj, called \u201ca new golden era in journalism.\u201d\u201cWithout a doubt, citizens of the United States are valuing newspapers and trusted, verified, distinctive journalism once again,\u201d he told me last week.It\u2019s probably not the result Mr. Trump is looking for. Then again, you never know.A peace envoy?Maybe not, Mr. Carter said, surmising that the younger Mr. Trump was there \u201cto check the place out to see if it was empty.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t, fortunately.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That change had begun to occur after the earlier Charlie Hebdo attack \u2014 something noted by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who named 2016 the Year of the \u201cMarseillaise.\u201dThis month, about 100 academics, government officials and military personnel gathered at a daylong conference at the French Defense Ministry to help mark an end to that commemoration. They debated the song\u2019s meaning, especially its climax that calls on people to \u201cwater the fields with impure blood\u201d (the debate was over whose blood it was). They discussed how its melody had inspired revolutionaries from Russia to Chile. And they listened to countless versions of it, a feminist \u201cMarseillaise\u201d going down particularly well (its chorus \u2014 \u201cTremble, tremble, jealous husbands\u201d \u2014 was met with laughter).Jean-Marc Todeschini, who is responsible for veteran affairs at the Defense Ministry, said that the Year of the Marseillaise was declared precisely so that the French, especially the young, could re-appropriate the republican values of the song, which was written by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in 1792 during the French Revolution.\u201cI am thinking in particular of freedom, resistance and fraternity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt belongs to all the French, not to one political party or sectarian ideology. It\u2019s important in the current context of terrorism and risk to our social cohesion to unite all French people around our hymn.\u201dAt the same time that the government has been promoting its reappropriation, others in France have been debating the value of the song \u2014 and its ability to unite \u2014 in less formal settings.\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with the mentality of singing it,\u201d said Philippe Fragione, better known as Akhenaton, one of France\u2019s most popular rappers. \u201cI\u2019m from Marseilles and there\u2019s always been a feeling there that we have to rebel against the state. My view changed a bit after the attacks when people in other countries were singing it \u2014 that showed solidarity \u2014 but sometimes politicians and fake philosophers use it to point out differences, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201dMagyd Cherfi, a French-Algerian writer and frontman of the band Zebda, said that in his view, \u201cthings have evolved in France\u201d over the past year, changing people\u2019s relationship to the country and the anthem. \u201cFear lives on every street now and people lose confidence in the nation. They take refuge in extremes.\u201dHe feels the same connection today, he said, but seems less certain about the anthem. \u201cThe Marseillaise is lost in modernity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt addresses the French of more than two centuries ago. I think it is good to change the text to make it more universal, because now France\u2019s children are black, Asian, North African. They must find themselves in it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really a fan of the tune, but it was the version by Berlioz, and it was most beautiful I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d he said. He buried his daughter on the same day. \u201cI can\u2019t separate it from those memories now. It\u2019s taken a different meaning to me, beyond an anthem.\u201dHe said the \u201cMarseillaise\u201d has probably helped unite the country since the attacks thanks to its lyrics \u201cagainst tyranny, absolutism and intolerance.\u201dHe said he understood why some disliked it, since he used to share many of their reservations. But he disagrees with calls to change the words. \u201cI don\u2019t like this idea of correcting pieces of art for political correctness purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are racist phrases in \u2018Tom Sawyer,\u2019 but you will not change \u2018Tom Sawyer.\u2019 \u201dThe Year of the Marseillaise has not put questions of national identity at its forefront, preferring initiatives focused on educating children about the anthem\u2019s origins.Speakers at the conference this month agreed that the anthem was playing perhaps its largest role since World War II, when it helped motivate people against German invaders and the collaborationist Vichy government.\u201cIn recent years, the Front National were the only party to use these republican symbols,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Dr\u00e9villon, a professor of modern history at Paris 1 university, referring to the far-right party. \u201cThe attacks gave legitimacy to the other parties to re-appropriate it.\u201dAll the candidates for next year\u2019s French presidential election have been singing it at rallies, he added.But several speakers noted that some in France were still uncomfortable with the anthem. They either find its lyrics calling citizens \u201cto arms\u201d outdated and violent, or find the line about \u201cimpure blood\u201d inflammatory given France\u2019s colonial history. French-Algerians and Corsicans booed the anthem at football matches in the 2000s.Mathieu Schwartz, a documentary maker who spoke at the conference, said such objections were not about \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d itself. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different from other national hymns,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a problem with the nation, you have a problem with it. If you changed the music or words, you\u2019d still have a problem.\u201dIsmael El Iraki, a Moroccan filmmaker who has been living in Paris for 15 years and escaped the Bataclan during the attacks, said the lyrics did not need to be changed.\u201cThat infamous line about impure blood is my favorite,\u201d he said, sharing an unusual interpretation from his high school history teacher: Rouget de Lisle was calling on people to shed their own impure blood in defense of the French Revolution \u2014 purity having been something previously associated with the aristocracy.\u201cThat\u2019s why I love the \u2018Marseillaise,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIn a moment in history where purity is used as a horrible goal by jihadists and right-wing fear mongers alike, I think it\u2019s a cool line to keep in mind, reminding us that impurity is our own, and our strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yet the social network recently has come under scrutiny from some of its biggest advertisers for errors in that data.This time, Facebook said it had inaccurately measured the number of people an advertiser had the potential to reach across the social network. The company is retooling the way it displays reactions to live videos, and is looking into incorrect displays of the number of likes or shares a Facebook post has received when someone is searching for it on a mobile device.Still, the missteps have given pause to some advertisers and ad buying agencies, many of which have moved more spending to Facebook in the past five years. Over the first half of 2016, marketers spent $5.7 billion on Facebook advertising in the United States, which represented 43 percent of digital advertising growth domestically, according to estimates from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Publicis Media, a major digital advertising buyer, advised clients of the errors in September and called for greater outside oversight of Facebook\u2019s measurement practices.In the months since, Facebook has tried to divulge more information to outsiders in a company blog called Metrics FYI.\u201cWe know how important it is to be open about meaningful updates we make to our metrics,\u201d Facebook said in its most recent post.Advertisement"}

That formula helped Algeria avoid the upheaval of the 2011 Arab Spring, but it has also stunted the oil-dependent country\u2019s economic development and thwarted democratic aspirations.So it was encouraging when Algeria adopted constitutional reforms in March to move toward a more open democracy. The reforms included guarantees of freedom of assembly and of the press, and appeared to make good on President Bouteflika\u2019s promise that he would \u201cspare no effort to consolidate and extend freedom of expression.\u201dBut Algeria\u2019s new constitutional guarantees have proved meaningless.

We eagerly await the inaugural celebrations.\u201d Nonetheless, the company did not respond to further inquiries or make any dancers available for interviews.Despite these assurances, many of the women may feel under pressure to perform. Much of the fear and confusion could be traced to an email sent on Thursday night by the union to some of the dancers.\u201cIf you are full time, you are obligated,\u201d said that message, which was forwarded to The New York Times. \u201cDoing the best performance to reflect an American institution which has been here for over 90 years is your job. I hope this pulls into focus the bottom line on this work.\u201dThe pressure to perform at the inauguration ceremony will probably vary based on the circumstances of each Rockette, according to a performer who spent five years with the company.Heather Lang, a contemporary dancer who left the Rockettes in 2009, said in a phone interview that there are about 12 full-time dancers who perform in both winter and spring shows. They are a minority of the company, which has about 80 Rockettes. All of the dancers were seasonal until about a year ago.Ms. Lang, 35, said that for full-time and seasonal dancers, there is a fear of jeopardizing their future employment and of compromising their standing in the eyes of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, and his executives, if they complain or try to bow out.\u201cOne of the most annoying situations about that job is it\u2019s corporate,\u201d Ms. Lang said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Broadway show where you feel like you have an artistic voice. You\u2019re sort of owned by this corporation.\u201dSo even if an appearance is considered voluntary, individual Rockettes may feel forced to perform if they are told that executives want them onstage in Washington.Ms. Lang said that performers are drawn to the company for the honor of dancing at Radio City Music Hall \u2014 as well as for the health benefits.Many of the women have feared standing up for themselves in the current controversy, she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in fear of losing their job.\u201dThe idea that Rockettes could be forced to perform prompted anger on Twitter among actors, performers and other celebrities, who began widely circulating contact information for the company, the Rockettes\u2019s producers and their union.Chris Pappas, a tour guide with Radio City Music Hall, said employees there were angry.\u201cI can say that as a member of the tour guide staff, we have discussed it, and it has upset us,\u201d Mr. Pappas said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not saying the Rockettes are invited to perform. It\u2019s saying that the Rockettes will perform.\u201dLast week, Boris Epshteyn, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, confirmed in an email that the 16-year-old opera singer Jackie Evancho would be performing the national anthem at the event, calling her a \u201ctrue role model and inspiration for people young and old in our country and around the globe.\u201dIn between commenting on Twitter about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and addressing business conflicts of interest within his family, the president-elect took time on Thursday evening to assure the nation that he did not want A-list celebrities attending his inauguration.Gia Kourlas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "N.F.L. Playoffs: Cowboys, Patriots and Raiders Hold Tight to Top Spots", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byThe N.F.L. playoff picture became much clearer on Sunday, with the Patriots, Raiders and Cowboys all tightening their grips on the top spots. Elsewhere, the Packers threw a wrench in the Lions\u2019 plans in the N.F.C. North, and the A.F.C. South is still a mess. Here\u2019s what we learned in N.F.L. Week 15:\u25a0 There is no quarterback controversy in Dallas.\u25a0 Tom Brady can win in Denver, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will be pretty. The Patriots\u2019 quarterback came into the game with a 2-7 record on the road against the Broncos (his season ended there in two of the last three seasons), but New England held onto the No. 1 seed in the A.F.C. with a boring victory. More good news for the Patriots: they probably won\u2019t have to face Denver in the playoffs because the Broncos\u2019 season is unraveling quickly.\u25a0 For the first time, fans can post on social media that the Oakland Raiders have qualified for the playoffs. It was 2002, long before Facebook, Twitter or even MySpace, when the Raiders last played a playoff game, but with a win over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday they secured a trip to the playoffs, have a lead in their division, and still have a chance at home field advantage throughout the playoffs. More importantly, the team\u2019s defense secured the victory, which could portend good things going forward.\u25a0 The A.F.C. South is still the ugly duckling division of the N.F.L., with the underwhelming Houston Texans continuing to lead the way (by virtue of a tiebreaker over Tennessee) after Sunday\u2019s win over Jacksonville. The Titans may not be much more fun to watch than Houston, but their upset victory over Kansas City would seemingly indicate that they are the superior team.\u25a0 Green Bay might just do this thing. In a 4-6 start to the season, the Packers seemed incompetent on both sides of the ball and were quickly falling out of postseason contention. But with four consecutive wins, and Ty Montgomery\u2019s emergence helping to balance out the team\u2019s offense, Green Bay will win the N.F.C. North if they win their two remaining games.Explore every team's path to the playoffs.A single loss after an 11-game winning streak led to a mass exodus from the Dak Prescott bandwagon last week. But the rookie quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys was apparently not willing to go off quietly into the night, having a big first half against Tampa Bay, and then holding off a valiant second-half comeback attempt by the Buccaneers in a 26-20 Dallas victory.The game was a return to form for Prescott, who threw two interceptions in last week\u2019s 10-7 loss to the Giants. For some doubters, that loss had restarted the quarterback controversy between Prescott and Tony Romo, which had seemed settled after Prescott and his fellow rookie, Ezekiel Elliott, led Dallas to the N.F.L.\u2019s best record with a mix of big plays and relatively few mistakes.Against Tampa Bay\u2019s formidable defense, both Dallas rookies showed why the league has come to fear them. Prescott completed 32 of 36 passes for 279 yards, and nabbed his sixth rushing touchdown of the season, breaking a tie with Don Meredith for the franchise record, which Meredith had held since 1966. Elliott was also a driving force, carrying the ball 23 times for 159 yards and a touchdown, and he played to the home crowd in the first half by leaping into an oversized Salvation Army bucket after scoring. He increased his N.F.L.-leading total to 1,551 rushing yards, becoming just the seventh rookie to run for more than 1,500.If there was a criticism of Dallas to be made it was that they had to rely on Dan Bailey to make four of his six field goal attempts to secure the win, but the team showed a great deal of resilience after Tampa Bay reeled off 14 unanswered points in the third quarter.Overall, the game was a mixed bag for Jameis Winston, who looked dominant in the third quarter but also personally accounted for four turnovers in the game, including three interceptions. He also had a costly unsportsmanlike penalty potentially cost his team a touchdown in the first half. Given the ball with a chance to win it as time was running out, Winston threw an interception on 4th-and-12 that effectively ended the game.With the win, Dallas continues to be the No. 1 seed in the N.F.C., and the team has a two-game lead in their division over the Giants. Tampa Bay, meanwhile, was knocked out of the second wild-card position in the N.F.C., with the Washington Redskins at 7-5-1 having a narrow lead over the 8-6 Buccaneers.The perennially-uncompetitive Oakland Raiders have risen to the top of the standings this season thanks to a high-powered offense. But it was gutsy work in the trenches by the team\u2019s less-celebrated defense that led to a 19-16 victory over the San Diego Chargers, putting the Raiders back in the playoffs for the first time since 2002.Struggling offensively for much of the game, the Raiders were down 16-13 in the fourth quarter when Kenneth Farrow of the Chargers ran the ball up the middle. He was stopped two yards short of the line of scrimmage and as he went down, Perry Riley of the Raiders stripped the ball away. After the officials had pulled enough players off the pile, Malcolm Smith came up with the ball, giving it back to the Raiders\u2019 offense on the 13-yard line.Oakland only came away with a field goal off the turnover, but the Raiders\u2019 defense came through yet again, forcing the Chargers to punt. Given the ball with 6:27 left in a tie game, Derek Carr engineered a 9-play 54-yard drive that ended with a 44-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski that put the Raiders in the lead to stay.The defense then came through yet again on San Diego\u2019s last drive, intercepting Rivers so Carr could kneel on the ball to seal the win.It was a slow day for Carr, who is considered by many to be a candidate for Most Valuable Player. He completed 19 of 30 passes for 213 yards and 1 touchdown, but he did just enough to let Janikowski, the only remaining member of the last Raiders playoff team, seal the victory.With the win, the Raiders have a one-game lead over the Kansas City Chiefs in the A.F.C. West with two games remaining. Oakland closes out their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts and then travel to Denver for a season-ending division matchup against the Broncos.Tom Brady wasn\u2019t perfect, but he didn\u2019t need to be against the struggling Denver Broncos.Brady started the game 0 for 6 on passing attempts \u2014 tying a career high \u2014 and he completed just 50 percent of his passes for the game, but with the help of LeGarrette Blount\u2019s 15th rushing touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski\u2019s three field goals, the New England Patriots beat the Broncos 16-3. With the win, the Patriots locked up their eighth straight A.F.C. East division title.While the Patriots\u2019 offense played things conservatively, with Brady completing just 16 of 32 passes for 188 yards, they got 95 rushing yards from Dion Lewis and the only true highlight of the game was when Blount ran in yet another goal-line score, breaking Curtis Martin\u2019s franchise record for single-season rushing touchdowns, which Martin set in 1995 and equaled in 1996.New England has a home game against the Jets next week and then finishes its season on the road against the Miami Dolphins.If the Green Bay Packers fulfill Aaron Rodgers\u2019 promise to \u201crun the table\u201d after a 4-6 start, which would secure the team the N.F.C. North title, it may be because the team finally found a reliable running back in the form of an unknown young wide receiver. Ty Montgomery\u2019s big first half, and a nail-biter of a second half in which the Chicago Bears erased a 17-point Packers lead, resulted in a 30-27 victory for Green Bay.In the end it was Aaron Rodgers who saved the Packers. On third-and-long with 40 seconds left in regulation, he threw a perfect deep ball (60 yards) to Jordy Nelson to set up the game-winning field goal by Mason Crosby.The win came in spite of Chicago having the biggest comeback in the team\u2019s history, which dates back to 1920, and it went a long way to opening up Green Bay\u2019s postseason chances. The Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions both lost, which means if the Packers, who face Detroit in Week 17, win the team\u2019s two remaining games, they will win the division.Single-digit temperatures in Chicago did not prevent either team from scoring, with Montgomery, who still wears No. 88 after being drafted as a receiver last season, having the best game of his young career. He has carried the ball 16 times for 162 yards, including 2 touchdowns and a 61-yard scamper in the second quarter that showed off his development at the position as he spun out of a tackle at the line of scrimmage, shed another tackler down field, and then turned on the jets on the long run. Later in the second quarter, a 36-yard run that helped set up a game-tying field goal was perhaps even more impressive as Montgomery carried a pile of players several yards down the field at the end of the play, showing off a power aspect of his game that had thus far been missing.The 17-point fourth quarter comeback by Matt Barkley and the Bears\u2019 offense was the biggest by either team in 194 games against each other, but a brutal third quarter, that included a fumble on a sack and two interceptions by Barkley proved too much to overcome when all was said and done.The Packers will look to extend the team\u2019s winning streak next week in a home game against the struggling Vikings, and could get some help in terms of a division title if the Lions lose in a tough matchup against the Dallas Cowboys.\u200bSo often already in his young N.F.L. career, Odell Beckham Jr. has seemed to pull the Giants to victory with his one-of-a-kind receiving gifts.A one-handed touchdown grab by Beckham late in the fourth quarter Sunday helped the Giants prevail, 17-6, at MetLife Stadium in a game between two of the N.F.C.\u2019s best teams. At 10-4, the Giants now have the conference\u2019s second-best record. Detroit fell to 9-5. \u2014 Zach SchonbrunRead our entire Giants game report here.Elsewhere around the league in Week 15:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Cyberforgers Steal Millions a Day With Fake Sites", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In a twist on the peddling of fake news to real people, researchers say a Russian cyberforgery ring has created more than half a million fake internet users and 250,000 fake websites to trick advertisers into collectively paying as much as $5 million a day for video ads that are never watched.The fraud, which began in September and is still going on, represents a new level of sophistication among criminals who seek to profit by using bots \u2014 computer programs that pretend to be people \u2014 to cheat advertisers.The thieves impersonated more than 6,100 news and content publishers, stealing advertising revenue that marketers intended to run on those sites, White Ops said.The scheme exploited known flaws in the system of digital advertising, including the lack of a consistent, reliable method for tracking ads and ensuring that they are shown to the promised audience.The spoofed outlets include a who\u2019s who of the web: video-laden sites like Fox News and CBS Sports, large news organizations like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, major content platforms like Facebook and Yahoo, and niche sites like Allrecipes.com and AccuWeather. Although the main targets were in the United States, news organizations in other countries were also affected.\u201cIt will be a big shock to all of these publishers that someone was selling inventory supposedly on their sites,\u201d Mr. Tiffany said in an interview on Monday, before the report\u2019s release. White Ops and an advertising industry organization, the Trustworthy Accountability Group, held a conference call with about 170 advertisers, ad networks and content publishers on Tuesday morning to brief them on their findings.To carry out the operation:Among those were Comcast, AT&T and Cox, as well as fake companies like AmOL. This allowed the thieves to make it look as if the web traffic from Methbot\u2019s servers in Dallas and Amsterdam were really coming from individual users of those internet providers.Embedded in the bots\u2019 web browsers were fake geographic locations, a fake history of other sites visited and fake logins to social networks like Facebook. \u201cThe bots would start and stop video just like people do and move the mouse and click,\u201d Mr. Tiffany said.A bot would pretend to visit a website like CNN.com, and the ad networks would conduct a microsecond bidding war against one another to show a brand\u2019s video ad. But instead of going to the real CNN, the bot\u2019s web browser would go to a fake site that nobody could see, and the ad would play there.\u201cIt would send just the right kind of metrics back to look like real live audiences that were logged into Facebook and watching videos all day,\u201d Mr. Tiffany said. The thieves then collected payment for the ads.The report did not name the advertisers tricked by the fraud.David Hahn, the executive vice president of strategy at Integral Ad Science, an advertising security firm that competes with White Ops, said the Methbot fraud affected just a tiny portion of the ad traffic of his own clients.\u201cThere are new bots and new ways in which the bad guys are trying to figure out ways around our technology all the time,\u201d he said.The automated ad networks that buy and sell access to ad space on popular websites operate in a murky, fast-paced world, and it\u2019s often unclear to advertisers who such middlemen truly represent.\u201cAs a buyer, how do you check that those other companies are authorized sellers of the ad inventory?\u201d said Neal Richter, who until recently was the chief technology officer for Rubicon Project, a major exchange for automated ad sales. \u201cYou need to know who you\u2019re doing business with.\u201dTrustworthy Accountability Group, which is a joint effort of the ad industry\u2019s major trade groups, is already blacklisting the internet addresses used by Methbot\u2019s bots, adding them to a master list used by many in the industry to screen out fraud.Mike Zaneis, the chief executive of the organization, said his group began a certification program last week to verify that ad exchanges truly represent the buyers and sellers they are claiming to represent. Under the system, payment for an ad flows directly to the website publisher, which would make it more difficult for forgers like the Methbot crew to get paid for their deception.Several news organizations whose websites were faked by Methbot, including The Times, said Tuesday they were still evaluating the fraud case.White Ops said the thieves received high prices for the fake ad views, garnering an average price of $13 per 1,000 video views. Over all, the botnet delivered 200 million to 300 million fake ad views per day and brought in $3 million to $5 million in daily revenue, according to the company\u2019s analysis.White Ops released the full list of fake internet addresses and impersonated websites so that fraud-detection services and ad networks can block them. The company has also shared its findings with United States law enforcement authorities and is working with them to further investigate the fraud.Mr. Tiffany said the use of bots to steal ad revenue is not new in the industry, but it \u201chas never happened at this scale before.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt all adds up to the most profitable bot operation we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dSapna Maheshwari contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

How did this year stack up compared to the others? The year was different because it was a presidential campaign year without an incumbent. It was also different as far as production, because my co-editor Meaghan Looram went on maternity leave, so Beth Flynn stepped in.  How many photos did you look at this year? Probably between 120,000 and 180,000, a little less than last year because Meaghan did a lot of the work as she was going along. A lot had been gathered already, since she was looking at images daily for Page 1. When I come on board it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more immersive. That is all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing for four or five weeks. But how do you choose? Not all of those photos are great, but you must have hit a few thousand really fine pictures. Which ones rise above the others? What is significant enough to make the cut?  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant enough besides these are the ones I like? Great journalistic photographs must have news value and show the compelling nature of the human experience, good and bad. Also, creative use of the photographic medium, and the technology. Imaginative yet objective \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not overprocessed.I like every part of the frame to be used. I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to crop. I try to use full frame almost always.I like the people who shoot for The New York Times and the style that we bring to the world of journalism. I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no comparison for me in most cases. We have a look. What is the style? What is that look?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a look where you see the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand in the image \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the facts.

When you look at a picture, you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Tomas Munita photo or a Doug Mills or a Damon Winter. Yet it is still totally ethically objective news photography. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sometimes unexpected, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re combing through all these pictures, something catches your eye and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just boom \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 everything in the right place. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important to me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like what Garry Winogrand said about why he makes photographs. I like how these things look photographed.  And I also like seeing the photographer there.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a photographer and shot professionally for many years. How does that play into your judgment? Is there something you bring to the table that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lifetime passion for me, and that helps.I know some of the challenges. As a photographer I studied the history of photography. It simplifies the editing. I did a lot of record industry advertising, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m used to editing lots of pictures very quickly. What\u2019s good composition? Every inch of the frame is used effectively to build the statement or to describe the event. There is no wasted space. If things like tilts or wide angles are used, it is to effectively describe what is before the camera.

They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just playing the top five \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though Keith Richards has done well with that.  But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never once given Keith Richards an assignment. How did you choose photos to represent this strange election?   Every election there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more and more spin control and restriction of media as well as less and less access. But there was a lot of photography of this campaign.I looked at 10,148 photos of Donald Trump once, but I had to go over them many times. That is a lot of Donald Trump. How did you choose a handful of photos of Donald Trump out of that 10,148? What brought these few to your attention? The amazing Damon Winter. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like catching a football from one of the greatest quarterbacks in the world. It was photos that I liked, and I could keep on looking at without getting tired of them. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this one by Damon of Trump on the tarmac with his team that I think is just an amazing image. It is a fantastic use of a wide-angle lens and his technique, the horizon, everything is dead on and in place. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mood to it. Also, some of the silhouetted photos.There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique picture that Chad Batka did of Donald Trump that was for the Sunday Review. Chad only got a few frames off. He was inches away from Trump with an 85 mm lens at his office. Trump stopped Chad and said that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want him to do that. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super conscious of what photographers are doing. Trump is a media guy. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a TV personality, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something he used effectively. What else? Tomas Munita\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos from Cuba were just gorgeous, including the work after Castro died. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a magnificent photographer. He has a certain look. They are objective news photos, but the personality of the photographer comes across.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very poetic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very poetic. Sergey Ponomarev\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work was great. Daniel Berehulak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work from the Philippines was shocking and amazing. Frame after frame.  Why does Daniel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work deserve three photos in the web presentation? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very important story. President Duterte is inciting this incredible violence. If you push people to do violence on each other without any due process, bad things happen. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it in Rwanda, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it in Germany and any number of other places. Daniel was there for 35 days, 41 murder scenes, and through it all he was making brilliant photographs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerful, powerful work.I also like the pictures of the FARC rebels from Colombia that Federico Rios Escobar shot for us on assignment. The shoot he did there is delightful. He captured a very human aspect of them I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen in photographs. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the Black Lives Matter picture by Logan Cyrus from Charlotte, N.C., that we are running in the print section extremely large across two full pages. That is a magnificent piece of news photography.  That was made on assignment for The Times. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controlled a chaotic scene and made it into a gripping, powerful moment.Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the now famous Jonathan Bachman \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen in the dress\u00e2\u0080\u009d photo made at a protest in Baton Rouge, La. We also had some magnificent photographers at the Olympics, including Chang Lee, James Hill and Doug Mills. It was hard to choose. Anything else stick out?  Todd Heisler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pictures from election night at Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event at the Javits center. And he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even in the room! He was outside of the main event room.Who took the overhead of Hillary Clinton with her arms out in Brooklyn? It was Doug Mills. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. Some of Josh Haner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate work is really lovely, too. You edited a web presentation of over 100 images and a print section with far fewer.  Are there differences in how you approach them?  In print Alexandra Zsigmond, the Opinion section art director, becomes a much bigger part of the selection process, because she has to make them work together on the page. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented chronologically more or less, so certain pictures and events have to be together and must work in palette and scale. She has the last word on the print short of Dean Baquet and Michele McNally. So everyone looks at this? Those people look at this, and also James Bennet, Jim Dao and Tom Bodkin. Are you going to do this again next year? I hope so. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Sunday Review tradition. So this is like the Yuletide log burning on a continuous loop on television on WPIX on Christmas Eve? Yes. (laughing) It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Yule log of The New York Times. "}

The woman made me promise that I would not ascribe any information to her daughter. Should I speak to my son? If so, how do I broach the subject without her story?ANONYMOUS MOM, NEW YORKDon\u2019t confront your son with what you heard. He may not be confiding in you because he is ashamed of his predicament. (I was.) Assume that it\u2019s true enough. One of the greatest kindnesses my dad showed me, when I was your son\u2019s age, was sharing in detail his own story of schoolboy misery at the hands of a classmate. It made me feel less alone, and we were able to build on that conversation. He told me his story rather than shaming me with mine. Can you initiate a talk like that? If not, enlist his father or cousin or aunt. (You won\u2019t have to look far.)Also, make an appointment with his school principal or guidance counselor to share your concern. They may not be aware of the problem, so putting it on their radar is an important start. Ask how they intend to tackle and monitor the situation. And stay on top of it. They may also be able to recommend affinity groups or students who will be more accepting of your son.Finally, thanks for writing. This is a big deal and can leave lasting marks on anyone.

But if their answer is, \u201cBecause we\u2019ve been talking about your adult children for the last 15 minutes,\u201d then I think asking about grandchildren, while still delicate, is more understandable.

White wrote in \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is New York,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his classic 1949 essay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis, more than any other thing, is responsible for its physical majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrow 2.2-mile width and its \u00e2\u0080\u009cremarkable variety of elements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes Peter Skinner, the author, made it an ideal subject for aerial photographers from the earliest days of the medium.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a greater height, the whole of Manhattan can be captured, with the Upper Bay to the south and the Harlem River to the north both helping frame the island,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Skinner writes in the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction.The first aerial photographs of New York, however, were \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot very impressive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. Smoke from coal fires in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing districts obscured otherwise picturesque views, and camera technology had not evolved enough to sufficiently compensate for the effects of bumpy flights in propeller-driven aircraft. Some of the best early aerial views of the city, at the beginning of the 1900s, come courtesy of the U.S. Army, though its compositions were, understandably, more utilitarian than artistic. But as the city became a powerful economic center in the first half of the 20th century, aerial photographers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambitions and capabilities rose in tandem, and their images from the sky helped shape the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagination of the booming metropolis. The joy and adventure of that pursuit is perfectly encapsulated in Oscar Graubner\u2019s 1935 photo of the daredevil photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White, seen with her camera astride a stainless steel eagle head decoration jutting from the Chrysler Building.Anecdotally, the book represents the full range of image-making innovations that made increasingly revelatory visions of the city possible, beginning with Joost Hartgers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1628 hand-drawn map of New Amsterdam\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first recorded view of the new settlement\u00e2\u0080\u0094and ending with a 2013 photo from the International Space Station, with other notable achievements, including the first aerial color photo of the Statue of Liberty, in between. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fully established artistic medium, not merely a recording medium. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been driven to great heights of creativity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Skinner said in an interview.Seen from thousands of feet up, New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inhabitants tend to disappear into the landscape. When they do make their mark, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s typically during monumental events like the annual New York City Marathon, whose brightly colored throngs Tim Orr captures crossing the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Crowds also appear in Tony Linck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1945 photo of celebration of V-E Day in Times Square, and again in a shot outside the New York Stock Exchange in the anxious opening days of the 1929 crash.While the book does capture something of life in New York, it serves primarily as a history of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapid development. An image of Columbus Circle in 1924 looks relatively quaint compared to a more recent one in which the newly added Time Warner Center and Trump International Hotel and Tower loom large. A photo of the 1,396-foot residential tower 432 Park Avenue, located just a few avenues east, serves as one of the latest examples of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ceaseless quest for greater heights. Other photos, meanwhile, highlight what the city has lost, including Ebbets Field and the World Trade Center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twin towers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNew York continues to be the most amazing place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ganun said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Correction: An earlier version of the caption for picture No. 8 in the accompanying slide show, using information from Prestel Publishing, overstated what is known about when the picture was taken.

{"Headline": "Advertising\u2019s Moral Struggle: Is Online Reach Worth the Hurt?", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byAdvertising on the internet has never been easier. Data and automation increasingly allow companies large and small to reach millions of people every month, and to tailor ads to specific groups based on their browsing habits or demographics.Now, however, the marketing industry is facing a moral quandary in the face of a national debate over the role that fake news played in the presidential election and the realization that many websites that promote false and misleading stories are motivated by the money they can make from online advertising.\u201cI would much rather pay a little premium as a brand and go for verified sites,\u201d Raja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer of MasterCard, said, noting that the company mostly advertised on sites it had evaluated and approved. \u201cBut it\u2019s a question again of how much and where. And I think all brands are doing this soul-searching at this point in time.\u201dThe problem is, most advertisers do not have the size or the financial wherewithal of MasterCard to simply opt out of the automated system as it now exists. And even if they do, there are tantalizing financial incentives to stay put.Much online advertising capitalizes on the lure of the so-called long tail of the internet \u2014 sites that draw relatively small but attractive audiences, like blogs for new parents or forums for truck enthusiasts. Advertising on those sites costs a fraction of what it does on more prominent online destinations, which typically deal directly with advertisers.Money is funneled to smaller sites through a complex system of agencies and third-party networks, which can resemble a stock exchange. This system, known as programmatic advertising, allows brands to collect many millions of impressions \u2014 an industry term that generally indicates that an ad has been displayed and can be viewed.Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said the system, set up to reward clicks and impressions, had fueled the growth of low-quality sites well beyond those focused on made-up political news.\u201cHonestly, the long tail is to advertising what subprime was to mortgages,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s in it, but it helps people believe that there is a mysterious tonnage of impressions that are really low cost. But low-cost impressions would mean low-cost human attention. How can any publisher of quality content survive on low-cost impressions?\u201dMarc Goldberg, chief executive of Trust Metrics, an ad safety vendor, said the effort to remove bad actors ignored the fact that many advertisers value impressions over everything else. They would rather not choose and monitor what websites they are appearing on, he said, because they worry they will miss out on potentially lucrative destinations.\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is introducing all of these bad sites into our ecosystem and not having the means to monitor them appropriately and effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big problem in our industry is our expectations of scale are not aligned with reality.\u201dRelatively speaking, the money going to fake political news is minuscule, but it has taken on outsize significance because it reflects a world in which marketers are often not paying attention to where their ads show up.\u201cA lot of ad buying systems are trying to show the right ad to the right person at the right time, and you see that mantra of those three variables across the industry,\u201d said Michael Tiffany, the chief executive and a founder of White Ops, an ad fraud detection company. \u201cNote how \u2018on the right site\u2019 doesn\u2019t make the list.\u201dIt is also watching out for its ads on fake news sites, which can slip through the cracks. Workable has about 110 employees and 6,000 customers but advertises on more than 50,000 sites a month through Google.\u201cTypically, Google has done a good job of keeping us off of low-quality sites,\u201d said John Short, vice president for demand generation at Workable.He added, \u201cWith fake news sites, or whatever you would like to call them, we need to be more alert.\u201dThis month, Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corporation, which owns The Wall Street Journal, described the digital ad market as \u201cdysfunctional.\u201dAd agencies, Mr. Thomson said at a conference held by UBS, should be \u201cresponsible for the audiences that they\u2019re creating, and then what they\u2019re serving those audiences and how they\u2019re serving those clients, because we\u2019ve sort of gone from the era of \u2018Mad Men\u2019 to mad metrics.\u201dInstead of using television networks, newspapers and magazines as proxies for reaching certain groups of people, many media buyers have been trained by automated advertising to use data and technology.Andrew Casale, the chief executive of Index Exchange, an advertising exchange, estimated that all the titles owned by the top 50 traditional media companies, including The Washington Post, Hearst and Cond\u00e9 Nast, probably accounted for 5 percent or less of the trillions of ad impressions available for sale each day.Overall spending on automated banner displays and video ads will grow to $18.7 billion this year worldwide, and the United States will account for half of that, according to Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\u201cThe problem, I think, for marketers is they\u2019ve been trained to value media universally,\u201d Mr. Casale said. \u201cFake news sites have really, really low prices and rates and tons of scale, so it\u2019s almost like a drug.\u201dMr. Tiffany, of White Ops, described one lure of automated buying. Say an advertiser wants to reach readers of The Atlantic or The New York Times who are in the market for a car. A relatively nondescript site might offer a price for 1,000 impressions that is one-fifteenth to one-twentieth what The Atlantic or The Times would charge, promising to deliver the same people who read The Atlantic or The Times, just later in the day.Mr. Thomson said he expected such programmatic advertising to come under even greater scrutiny.\u201cI would expect not only there\u2019s an existential debate about news and fake news,\u201d he said at the UBS conference, \u201cbut for that to flow into an existential debate about the role of advertising in society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Oklahoma Newspaper Endorsed Clinton. It Hasn\u2019t Been Forgiven.", "Date": "2016-12-26", "News": "Supported byENID, Okla. \u2014 One Sunday after church, Jeff Mullin and his wife were in line at the Western Sizzlin steakhouse here when a man, fists clenched, threatened to beat the hell out of him.\u201cMy first thought was just to kind of try to keep things calm. Otherwise, it was going to be two old guys rolling around on the floor of the steakhouse, and that would be pretty unseemly,\u201d recalled Mr. Mullin, 64, the mustachioed senior writer for Enid\u2019s daily newspaper, The Enid News & Eagle.The dispute was not personal. It was, of all things, editorial.It was the first Democratic endorsement for president in the modern history of the newspaper, which was founded in 1893. As the man\u2019s reaction at the steakhouse suggested, Enid was stunned, and this slow-paced agricultural town of 52,000 near the Kansas state line has not been the same since.The News & Eagle, with a circulation of 10,000, lost 162 subscribers who canceled the paper. Eleven advertisers pulled their ads, including a funeral home that had a sizable account. Someone stuck a \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d bumper sticker on the glass doors of the paper\u2019s downtown office. A man left a late-night message on the publisher\u2019s voice mail, expressing his hope that readers would deliver, to put it delicately, a burning sack of steaming excrement to the paper.Yet for the most part, the fallout at those large metropolitan newspapers was short-lived and barely noticed. The Star-Telegram\u2019s editorial in October, \u201cSay No to Trump,\u201d led to more than 100 canceled subscriptions, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its circulation.In Enid, however, sentiment about the endorsement lingers weeks after the election.Days after the editorial, Paul Allen, 81, one of Enid\u2019s most prominent residents \u2014 he financed construction of the ballpark downtown \u2014 stepped into the paper\u2019s offices on Broadway. He walked past the statue of an eagle in the lobby and canceled his 43-year-old subscription at the front desk. He might have done it sooner, but hesitated because he knows the publisher, Jeff L. Funk, whom he sees at weekly Rotary Club meetings.\u201cI like Jeff a lot,\u201d said Mr. Allen, a co-founder of a meat processing company that is the largest private employer in town. \u201cThat was one reason I debated it, because I didn\u2019t want to offend him.\u201cI wasn\u2019t gloating over it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just felt like it was kind of my duty almost. When I saw that headline, I was shocked. It was sickening to me.\u201dThe News & Eagle\u2019s 730-word editorial showed the raw power of partisanship in small-town America, the extraordinary divisions exposed in this election and the surprising ways in today\u2019s digital media age that newspaper endorsements still have the power to generate a reaction, even if they don\u2019t necessarily change people\u2019s votes.\u201cThere used to be a saying that the editorial page was the soul of a newspaper, and if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got a lot of weak-souled newspapers in the country because they\u2019re afraid to offend anybody,\u201d said Terry M. Clark, the director of the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame and a professor of journalism at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond. \u201cThis is an excellent example of the way American journalism ought to be \u2014 standing for something \u2014 and, man, it takes guts to do that in Enid, Okla.\u201dThe News & Eagle, which urged readers in the Republican primary to support Senator Marco Rubio for president, stands by its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. But it has also been busy doing damage control.One reader who stopped taking the paper said it was still trying to woo him back by delivering an occasional copy to his doorstep. The executive editor, Rob Collins, has worked the phones, talking to subscribers who had canceled or threatened to do so.\u201cI talked a lot of people off the ledge,\u201d said Mr. Collins, who grew up in Enid and whose father was a respected car salesman. \u201cPeople knew my dad or know my mom and know my family here. A lot of people who were angry called expecting me to argue right back with them. Really, the only time I would raise my voice is when I would get cursed at or yelled at, which I don\u2019t really like.\u201cI hope people can respect that we\u2019re entitled to our opinion, too, and that that can be different from news,\u201d he added.The editorial took shape from notes that Mr. Funk, the publisher, supplied to Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins refined the notes and was the primary author of the endorsement, which was debated and approved by the paper\u2019s seven-member editorial board. The paper\u2019s corporate parent, Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which is based in Alabama and owns newspapers and websites in 23 states, also played a role.\u201cIt was our decision at the corporate level, which of course was made known to all of our papers, that Donald Trump did not meet our company and journalism values, particularly as they related to the First Amendment,\u201d said Bill Ketter, the senior vice president for news.Asked if the Enid editorial board had the freedom to endorse Mr. Trump, he replied: \u201cLet me put it this way. We would have been disappointed. Did we demand that they do something? No, we didn\u2019t do that. We set out our principles and our standards.\u201dEnid is roughly 100 miles north of Oklahoma City, and people here still like to debate whether the town gets its name from a character in a Tennyson poem or, according to urban legend, from a joke played on an old chuck wagon sign. (Enid is, after all, \u201cDine\u201d spelled backward.) The jets from Vance Air Force Base fly so low that residents like to say they can read the markings on the bottoms of the aircraft.\u201cI\u2019m unhappy with the whole media,\u201d said Jody Traynor, 67, a four-decade subscriber who stopped taking the paper after the endorsement. \u201cAll of them. They lean too much. They\u2019re supposed to just tell me the news and let me decide.\u201d\u201cWe gained one subscriber out of the endorsement editorial,\u201d Mr. Funk said. \u201cWe lost 162, but we gained one.\u201d\u201cLooking back on it, I think it was all talk, but at the time I thought there was a possibility that he might take a swing at me,\u201d said Mr. Mullin, a member of the editorial board. \u201cAnd I thought this is crazy. This is a newspaper endorsement. Some of the people almost seemed hurt. Like, \u2018How can my newspaper\u2019 \u2014 in a small town like this, it\u2019s their newspaper \u2014 \u2018do this to me?\u2019 I think there was almost a sense of betrayal.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption misstated the given name of the senior reporter for The Enid News & Eagle who had a run-in with a man over the newspaper\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton. The reporter\u2019s name is Jeff Mullin, not John.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Join Our Board: Companies Hotly Pursue New Wave of Women in Tech", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For months, technology companies have pursued Amy Chang.\u201cI turned down 15 to 20 first meetings\u201d about joining a company board this year, said Ms. Chang, 39, who was an executive at Google for seven years before founding Accompany, which makes an executive-briefing app. \u201cThis whole thing is so crazy.\u201dEven by Silicon Valley standards, where recruiting wars are legion, attracting women to join tech company boards has become intense. While many companies still want the highest-profile women in the industry \u2014 think Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook or Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise \u2014 a new pool of candidates is also being hotly pursued. And those women are younger, tend to be ethnically diverse and have grown up in digital businesses for much of their careers.\u201cBoards are looking at diversity across multiple dimensions, such as gender, ethnicity, age and unique skill sets,\u201d said David Chun, the chief executive of Equilar, which tracks board candidates and executive compensation. \u201cIf you can bring a number of these different attributes and perspectives to the boardroom, you\u2019ll be in high demand.\u201dThe clamor for these women has spread beyond Silicon Valley\u2019s large public tech companies to privately held start-ups as well, some of which could emerge as the next public giants. Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, a closely held online real estate brokerage, said he sometimes had to mount \u201cpitched efforts\u201d to attract female candidates to his company\u2019s nine-member board, because many other start-up chief executives were after the same people.\u201cA lot of executives are trying to do this,\u201d Mr. Kelman said. \u201cIf I dillydallied, suddenly everyone was recruiting\u201d the same person.Ms. Bornstein, 46, a former chief digital officer at Sephora, said she had gotten 30 or 40 calls to discuss joining a corporate board over the last few years, even though she had never sat on one. Before becoming a member of Redfin\u2019s board, Ms. Bornstein said, she also talked to two public companies about a board spot, though she lost out to other women for those positions.Yet many hurdles still prevent women from joining more tech boards, Ms. Bornstein said. As she interviewed at companies about board seats, she said, she found that many directors typically stuck to their own networks of acquaintances for candidates. That generally led to looking at the same people over and over again.As a rule of thumb, boards also want experienced members. Part of the reason Ms. Bornstein said she did not land other board positions was because \u201cthey couldn\u2019t get their head around someone who hadn\u2019t been on a board before.\u201d Because there are \u201cfewer natural high-profile women in tech,\u201d she said, \u201cit requires taking bets on new people.\u201dTheBoardlist now has 1,300 names, up from 600 when the effort began, Ms. Singh Cassidy said. Less than half of those on the list have prior board experience, reflecting the up-and-coming nature of the group. Companies seeking a female board member can search through the list for ideas.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of educating that needs to be done,\u201d said Ms. Singh Cassidy, who is on the boards of TripAdvisor and Ericsson. But she said she was encouraged that some of the larger tech companies had embraced board diversity, which has spilled over to start-ups. \u201cThere has been pressure from all parts of the ecosystem, which has created a groundswell,\u201d she said.In the end, it often takes a chief executive to be open-minded about recruiting a different type of board member. That is what happened with Ms. Chang at Cisco.That kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is atypical of board members at Cisco, where directors tend to be more experienced. The company\u2019s longtime board members include John L. Hennessy, 64, the former president of Stanford University, and Carol Bartz, 68, the former chief executive of Yahoo.Yet Ms. Chang\u2019s differences were precisely what drew Chuck Robbins, Cisco\u2019s chief executive. After seeing the Accompany app this year and learning about Ms. Chang, he met with her and they hit it off. Ms. Chang soon interviewed with other Cisco board members, who concluded she would be an asset, Mr. Robbins said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s all about bringing on fresh perspectives and a different set of experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means they bring a different set of thinking to the boardroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Chiefs Notably Absent From Trump\u2019s Cabinet of Business Advisers", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byIn President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s newly named kitchen cabinet of business advisers, Wall Street is in. Silicon Valley is out.Mr. Trump has named 16 business leaders to serve on what\u2019s being called the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, described as a group meant to guide his administration on economic matters.The list is notable for leaning toward New York executives and industries \u2014 finance in particular. The list echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for a number of major economic positions, including Treasury secretary (the former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager Steven T. Mnuchin) and commerce secretary (the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross).Given his long experience as a New York real estate investor, Mr. Trump\u2019s selections may not come as a surprise.\u201cDonald comes from the financial services world. I think he tends to pick people who he\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who is leading the forum effort, told CNBC Friday afternoon.It is a bipartisan list, nonetheless, with a number of members who traditionally have favored Democratic candidates, including Laurence D. Fink of the asset management colossus BlackRock, Mary T. Barra of General Motors and Robert Iger of Walt Disney.\u201cThis forum brings together C.E.O.s and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cMy administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise.\u201dThe group is expected to meet with Mr. Trump monthly. The first meeting will be at the White House in early February. Mr. Schwarzman will serve as chairman.Mr. Schwarzman was not a vocal supporter or fund-raiser for Mr. Trump. Since the election, however, he has embraced the notion that the president-elect\u2019s promise to pull back financial regulations and cut taxes will supercharge the economy.In public and in private, Mr. Schwarzman has lately said that he is \u201cexcited\u201d about the potential for economic growth in a Trump administration.\u201cThere are going to be so many of these changes that I think what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s really going to force growth from a policy perspective,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said at the conference.Despite his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Schwarzman has signaled privately that he would not commit to a full-time position in the administration, but was otherwise interested in helping to advise the president-elect.Other Wall Street heavyweights on the list are Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Adebayo Ogunlesi, a former Credit Suisse executive who is the chairman of the investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. Mr. Ogunlesi is also a board member at Goldman Sachs. No Goldman executives were named to the forum.Forum members with ties to the finance industry include Paul S. Atkins, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now the chief executive of a finance regulation consulting firm, and Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley executive and a former governor of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Dimon is easier to understand. Though initially a supporter of President Obama, the JPMorgan chief has long been critical of the current administration\u2019s financial regulatory overhaul. While his name had been floated as a potential candidate for Treasury secretary, people close to him have insisted that he had no interest in taking on a full-time commitment outside of his bank.Aside from Virginia M. Rometty of IBM, there is hardly any representation of technology companies, and certainly none from Silicon Valley.Indeed, many Silicon Valley luminaries have opposed Mr. Trump since the presidential campaign. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was an enthusiastic supporter of both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.The rest of the advisory group appears to be a bipartisan mixture of business chiefs drawn from the worlds of finance, media and manufacturing. They include Ms. Barra, Mr. Iger, Doug McMillon of Walmart and W. James McNerney Jr., formerly of Boeing.Mr. Trump\u2019s style and speech are sometimes seen as throwbacks to the Reagan administration, and Mr. Welch was the iconic business leader of that era.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hillary Clinton Selfie as Political Salve, or Weapon", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIn the weeks since the election, some Americans have found a new folk hero in a familiar face: Hillary Clinton, comfortably dressed suburban retiree.Each chance Clinton meeting is marked with a digital memento: A selfie with the woman who would be president (sometimes photographed by a man who already was).These photos are posted and passed around the liberal social media bubble, where they\u2019re received like salves for the lingering pain of the election. The selfie offerings have collectively racked up tens of thousands of likes and shares on social media, along with coverage from CNN, Vogue and The Daily Mail.But the real message is in the visuals. In each photograph, Mrs. Clinton smiles warmly. Her face is free of makeup, her hair undone. She wears practical layers \u2014 leggings, turtlenecks, patterned fleeces, fun scarves. After the knock-down, drag-out battle of the campaign, the images suggest she has, unexpectedly, found peace. She has cast off the militaristic coats, the pantsuit uniform, the helmet hairdo and the mask of TV news makeup that she wore as Hillary Clinton, embattled Democratic hopeful and Republican villain. Now she presents as a recently retired woman living her best life.But there is another way of looking at these images from the left. While some are warmed by the shots, others are exhausted by a meme that exalts a Clinton whose candidacy helped torpedo the Democratic Party to its lowest political power in years.Off-putting to some \u2014 especially those who feel Mrs. Clinton pulled the party to the center, only to lose \u2014 is that the selfies, and the commentary swirling around them, telegraph an attitude of almost religious reverence for Mrs. Clinton. They reek of the blinkered Democratic worldview that saw Mrs. Clinton as so qualified, deserving, even destined for the presidency that prospective challengers ought to clear the way of her path to the nomination. And following her stunning loss, they present Mrs. Clinton as innocent of blame for the country\u2019s new direction. Writing in the leftist labor publication In These Times, Kathleen Geier critiqued the \u201cpro-Clinton media bubble\u201d that\u2019s rushed to enshrine the candidate postelection, while continuing to ignore the legions of voters who hold a \u201cfar less rosy view.\u201dThis is how it goes on the partisan internet of 2016: Even a nice, smiling photograph quickly becomes a Rorschach test, a vessel for all the fears, demons, aspirations, fantasies and victory laps that can be conjured by the farthest reaches of the political spectrum, and everyone in between.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTwo years ago, the creative and design teams at the toy company Spin Master came up with a big idea they called \u201cHatchimals\u201d\u2014 an interactive, furry creature that hatches out of an egg and grows up before your eyes.Coaxing a creature out of its shell \u201cresonates very well with kids,\u201d said James Martin, senior vice president and head of global business at Spin Master, a Canadian toy company that also sells Etch A Sketch, among many other products. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside and they get excited about what they may get. There\u2019s this anticipation that builds.\u201dThe company, however, did not bargain on quite this much anticipation. Since their introduction in October, Hatchimals, which have a suggested retail price of $59.99, have become the hot toy of the holiday season that nobody can find. Desperate parents intent on buying a Hatchimal are waiting in long lines at retailers, putting their names on waiting lists, and even buying lottery tickets for the toy. Sellers on Amazon and eBay were asking more than three times the retail price on Friday.Though Spin Master is rushing distribution by airfreighting the remaining Hatchimals from factories in China, the company has not said how many more will be available throughout December, and the shortage is expected to continue. A new batch of Hatchimals will not be available until early in 2017.Spin Master worked to generate buzz for Hatchimals with a secretive launch, and managed to keep all images off the internet until the toy officially \u201chatched\u201d on Oct. 7, which it called \u201cGlobal Hatchimals Day.\u201d Company executives also planned for what they thought would be the right amount of product supply to meet the holiday demand. The company declined to release sales figures.\u201cBy all analyses, we thought we had enough,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cWe had no idea that it would be this big. It\u2019s been exciting but it\u2019s also been daunting as we try to catch up and fill that demand.\u201dThe toy is finding an audience in both boys and girls ranging in age from 3 to 12 years old \u2014 which is a larger demographic than the company expected.\u201cNobody knows why these things happen. They\u2019re an act of God,\u201d said Richard Gottlieb, chief executive of Global Toy Experts and publisher of Global Toy News. While the product may be clever, said Mr. Gottlieb, \u201cit\u2019s all about a moment in time, and it\u2019s hard to predict what makes a product connect.\u201dMandy Nigbur, a stockbroker in Riverton, Utah, knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to find a Hatchimal when her 7-year-old daughter requested one from Santa. So when Santa Claus made an appearance at her family party over Thanksgiving weekend, he \u201cknew to tell her his elves weren\u2019t making very many and they might be hard to come by,\u201d Ms. Nigbur said. \u201cBut I was on the hunt.\u201dMs. Nigbur and three of her friends took to the internet and found a website that alerts customers to what\u2019s in stock at retailers near them. They learned that their local Target was supposed to get a small shipment of Hatchimals on Friday, so the women arrived at Target at 4:45 a.m. and waited outside in the 20-degree cold. Their efforts paid off. They each purchased a Hatchimal, which Target sold for the suggested retail price \u2013 and quickly sold out of.\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if Mommy gets to be the star or if Santa will be the one who gets to bring it to her,\u201d said Ms. Nigbur, who said she may be more excited about nabbing the product than her daughter will be to receive it.The chase and the rush to find the item is actually part of the appeal when a certain toy \u2014 such as Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo \u2014 becomes a phenomenon, according to Mr. Gottlieb. \u201cThere is an irrational exuberance on the part of the consumer with these buying frenzies, which leads to a scarcity of product and crazy high prices,\u201d he said.Some parents have given up on finding a Hatchimal before the holidays. \u201cI am not proud to say I entered into a raffle to win a Hatchimal on a Facebook group,\u201d said Lindsey Hunter Lopez of Los Angeles, whose 3-year-old daughter asked for the toy. \u201cIt was a $10 buy-in for a spot, with 16 spots,\u201d she said. Ms. Lopez did not win the raffle, and said that she would not be hunting for the toy any further.Spin Master hopes to keep the excitement going well past the holidays, and promises that 2017 will bring new species of Hatchimals with more features. \u201cWe\u2019re telling consumers to just be patient,\u201d said Mr. Martin. \u201cThe magic is just as magical in January as it is in December. The experience is just as exciting then. In fact, it may be even a little more because you\u2019ll be getting the first batch of 2017.\u201dBut will kids still want Hatchimals next year, or will they have moved on?\u201cIt\u2019s a hit-driven industry and this is an expensive item, which really tend to sell only at holiday time,\u201d said Gerrick Johnson, an equity research analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s why the company is willing to airfreight, which is expensive, in order to capture those spending dollars now; rarely do you have an item like this that works two seasons in a row.\u201dSarah Gough, who lives near Guatemala City, is still halfheartedly searching for a Hatchimal for her 10-year-old daughter, but is not expecting to find one soon. \u201cI looked at our major retailer twice and they don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d Ms. Gough said. She plans to ask her parents to look for the toy in the United States. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t really into standing in any lines to pick up toys,\u201d she said.To those parents who are not able to buy the toy in time, Dr. Deborah Gilboa, a family physician in Pittsburgh and a parenting and youth development expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great lesson in delayed gratification.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cathedral Bombing in Cairo Leaves Egypt Alarmed, and Its President Scrambling", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byStanding alongside Pope Tawadros II, the leader of the Coptic Church, Mr. Sisi identified a 22-year-old man who he said detonated a suicide vest in a chapel on the grounds of St. Mark\u2019s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, the seat of Egypt\u2019s Orthodox Christian Church, during Mass. At least 25 people, most of them women, died in the attack, the deadliest in years against Egyptian Christians.Mr. Sisi said the authorities had arrested four of the bomber\u2019s accomplices and were looking for two others.The compact has come under strain this year as Mr. Sisi has struggled to contain attacks on Copts in Upper Egypt and, now, a major terrorist bombing in the symbolic heart of the Egyptian Orthodox Church.After the bombing on Sunday, angry protesters gathered at the cathedral gates, shouting insults at Mr. Sisi\u2019s government, calling for the resignation of the interior minister and pushing away several pro-Sisi television journalists.That fury appeared to have abated somewhat on Monday as Mr. Sisi sought to assure Coptic leaders that the authorities, in identifying the man suspected of being the bomber, had solved the case. Turning to face Pope Tawadros, he said, \u201cWe could not come here to you, your holiness the pope, without knowing the basics of the case.\u201dEgyptian officials reported further arrests late Monday, but did not give further details.Many Egyptians, however, including some Copts, were skeptical that the authorities could have unveiled the plot so quickly. \u201cIt seems dubious in many ways,\u201d said Wael Eskander, a prominent blogger. And militancy experts said the nakedly sectarian attack offered alarming proof that Egypt\u2019s hydra-headed Islamist insurgency is growing in complexity and ambition.Without identifying the Brotherhood by name, Mr. Sisi said the bombing was the work of forces that \u201chave spent three years trying to shake us\u201d \u2014 a reference to the same period in which his government has instituted a fierce crackdown on Brotherhood supporters, thousands of whom have been jailed.But experts say the bombing was more likely carried out by a Salafist group like the Islamic State or Al Qaeda, which have a long history of sectarian massacres. Hasm, a group officials have linked to disaffected Muslim Brotherhood supporters, and which claimed the earlier bombing in Cairo on Friday, has mostly directed its attacks at state or security officials.\u201cThis is the most complex insurgency Egypt has seen in its modern history,\u201d said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. \u201cWe have competing militant groups, all with the goal of destabilizing the government and causing havoc.\u201dEarly details about the trajectory of Mahmoud Shafik Mohamed Mostafa, the man blamed for the bombing on Sunday, illustrates the challenge.Mr. Mostafa first came to public attention in 2014, when he was arrested at a Muslim Brotherhood protest in Fayoum, south of Cairo. Local news media reports showed a photograph of Mr. Mostafa, his face bloodied and his arms bound, standing with another suspect alongside a rifle and ammunition the police said they had seized from them. Yasmin Hosam El Din, a lawyer who represented Mr. Mostafa at the time, said in a Facebook post on Monday that he had been tortured in custody and was released in 2015.But of late Mr. Mostafa has become known by the alias Abu Dagana el-Kanani \u2014 a sign, experts say, of possible recruitment by a Salafist group like the Islamic State.\u201cThere have been numerous cases of Egyptian Islamists who went to Libya and the Levant, by way of Sudan, and dived into the fight with Islamic State,\u201d Mr. Awad said. While he lacked independent information about Mr. Mostafa, Mr. Awad said that such a path was \u201cconsistent with how the group has been operating in Egypt.\u201dOne wing of the Islamic State in Egypt is battling the Egyptian Army in the Sinai Peninsula while another operates through underground cells in major cities.

The time on your wristwatch is not the same as solar time on a sundial.We, as humans, define one day as midnight to midnight \u2014 exactly 24 hours \u2014 but the sun is running on a slightly different schedule. This misalignment between our clocks and the sun is the reason that the earliest sunset differs from the shortest day, Dr. Pagnotta said.Catch the rays while you can \u2014 4:28 is an early bedtime.Advertisement"}

They want something new,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nucci said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to go to the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe knew that the traditional way of life in these villages was vanishing, and he wanted to photograph it while it lasted. The resulting project is called DEntroTerra, a portmanteau of three Italian words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cdentro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009cinside\u00e2\u0080\u009d the place Mr. Nucci comes from; \u00e2\u0080\u009cterra,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cland\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and \u00e2\u0080\u009centroterra,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the upcountry, or the rural inner areas of Italy that Mr. Nucci says preserve a \u00e2\u0080\u009clifestyle nowadays lost in the rest of the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He has been documenting this way of life in villages in the Alto Molise and Alto Sangro regions of Molise and Abruzzo, traveling through the provinces of Isernia and Chieti: to Sant\u2019Angelo del Pesco, Capracotta, Castel del Giudice, Borrello (the village his mother comes from) and other towns and districts. Though he is meeting many residents for the first time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his fixer, also from the Alto Molise region, introduced him to some from other towns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he has built lasting relationships with his subjects. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I go and talk to them, they recognize the slang\u00e2\u0080\u009d of another upcountry local, he said.He grew up in that world of upcountry traditions, its values imparted largely by his grandfather. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had used to go and live these traditions with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nucci, 34, said. By the time his grandfather died, Mr. Nucci had already moved away from his home village. But 20 years later, the life he had experienced was still sharp in his memory, and he was aware that those customs were gradually disappearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt the need to tell something very intimate and personal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the area where he was born, a place with which he had a contradictory relationship, one of equal desires to escape and conserve.He especially sought to capture the rituals of daily life that have become rarer over time: religious and agricultural events, like the pig slaughter in January, the harvesting of grapes, the Ndocciata procession during Christmas and the numerous small pilgrimages that occur annually, with people following an old path to visit an image of the Virgin Mary or an icon in another village. Many have a second job outside their village or family farm, working in local government or factories, or doing seasonal labor. Most children commute to school in other towns. Yet tending a small piece of land is still considered important, Mr. Nucci said, particularly by the older residents who are devoted to preserving upcountry traditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of them, among the older people, think that everything will end with them, with that generation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nucci said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe generation of my grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis images offer a glimpse into a personal world, showing families preparing meals, harvesting and hunting food, and having festive celebrations.Plenty of photos focus on rituals and work, but Mr. Nucci also catches his subjects in reflective moments, while they tell him stories of their past. One woman stands in the snow recalling previous storms, while another man remembers aloud the glory days of his family\u2019s farm. Some of these towns were razed during World War II because they lay on Germany\u2019s Gustav Line in the Apennine Mountains \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a memory that, Mr. Nucci said, is still seared into the minds of the survivors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, probably, there is this distance between my generation and theirs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have lots from life, and they had little.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome traditions may be waning, but Mr. Nucci discovered that others have lingered elsewhere after villagers immigrated. His own grandmother, for instance, moved to Pittsburgh, and he saw hints of his home in traditions kept alive in a community of transplanted Sant\u2019Angelo del Pesco residents and their descendants. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe lived in another country, but she never really changed her roots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw her speak in my slang and prepare food as if we were in Italy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Nucci hopes that, in a similar way, his photos can help sustain the values of the rural culture of his childhood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is important to preserve tradition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is important to preserve your roots.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

New groups are forming, and interfaith coalitions that already existed say interest is increasing.Until Mr. Trump was elected president, Ms. Firdaus, who is 56 and a manufacturing manager at Exxon Mobil, felt secure living as a Muslim in America. She has a daughter who is a doctor and a son who is an engineer, and she recently traveled to Tampa with her husband looking to buy a vacation home. But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has shaken her sense of comfort and security.\u201cWhen did you know it was time to leave?\u201d Ms. Firdaus asked one woman who had just recounted how her relatives had fled the Nazis. \u201cThe ones that didn\u2019t leave are the ones who went to Auschwitz.\u201dThe Jewish women tried to convince her that they would not let it come to that. \u201cIf Muslims have to register, we\u2019re all going to register,\u201d said Mahela Morrow-Jones, who is helping to build the first West Coast chapter of the Sisterhood in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe it, sister.\u201dGroups are reaching out not just to clergy members, but also to laypeople, including business executives, students and women.Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a recent interview: \u201cJews know what it means to be identified and tagged, to be registered and pulled aside. It evokes very deep emotions in the Jewish community.\u201dMr. Greenblatt received a standing ovation when he declared at his organization\u2019s conference in Manhattan last month that if Muslims were ever forced to register, \u201cthat is the day that this proud Jew will register as a Muslim.\u201d\u201cAll of us have heard the story of the Danish king who said if his country\u2019s Jews had to wear a gold star,\u201d he said, \u201call of Denmark would, too.\u201dNearly 500 Muslim and Jewish women, many wearing head scarves and skullcaps, gathered on Sunday at Drew University in Madison, N.J., in what organizers said was the largest such meeting ever held in the United States. It was the third annual conference of the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, a grass-roots group that now claims 50 chapters in more than 20 states. The first conference two years ago drew only 100 people.The women spread out inside an enormous sports complex and met in clusters to study sacred texts on the racquetball courts, practice self-defense techniques in the dance studio and, in the bleachers, discuss how to talk to friends whose impression of Islam had been shaped entirely by news of terrorist attacks.\u201cIgnorance is one of the key triggers of hate,\u201d said Sheryl Olitzky, the group\u2019s executive director, in her opening remarks. \u201cWe need to show the world that we are Americans.

It was created by leaders of the American Jewish Committee and the Islamic Society of North America in an effort to have influence on public policy. The group intends to oppose a registry, support immigrants and refugees, and push for accommodating religious practices in the workplace.The selection of General Flynn prompted the usually stoic Ms. Firdaus to rethink her situation. She abandoned the plan to buy a vacation home in Tampa, or anywhere in the United States, at least for now. Instead, she and her family will spend Christmas vacation in Toronto, where they intend to open a bank account and look for a condominium to buy \u2014 just in case they have to flee.Attending the Sisterhood conference on Sunday, however, Ms. Firdaus said she was feeling a bit more optimistic. She was surrounded by Jews who pledged not to abandon Muslims.

{"Headline": "Is Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet Anti-Woman?", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byDispatchDonald J. Trump\u2019s campaign was dogged by accusations of misogyny. Now his cabinet is shaping up to be one of the most hostile in recent memory to issues affecting women, advocacy groups for women say. Tax credits for child care and the prospect of paid maternity leave are exceptions to a host of positions that could result in new restrictions on abortion and less access to contraception, limits on health care that disproportionately affect women and minorities and curbs on funding for domestic violence, as well as slowing the momentum toward raising the minimum wage or making progress on equal pay.Consider their positions on these issues.Domestic violenceJeff Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s selection for attorney general; Tom Price, chosen for Health and Human Services secretary; and Mike Pompeo, the pick for C.I.A. director, all voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2013, which funds shelters and services for victims of domestic violence, because of amendments extending protections to L.G.B.T. victims. The act is up for reauthorization next year.Pay discrimination and equal paySenator Sessions and Representative Price also voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which extended the statute of limitations to allow women to sue for pay discrimination.Mr. Sessions, as well as Elaine Chao, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for transportation secretary, opposed the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would have strengthened federal equal pay laws for women.Minimum wageMs. Chao, in her tenure as secretary of labor in the George W. Bush administration, opposed raising the minimum wage. President-elect Trump generally opposed raising the federal minimum wage during the campaign, although he occasionally contradicted himself. Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, points out that two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women, who dominate fields with low-paying service jobs.AbortionIn Congress, Senator Sessions and Representatives Price and Pompeo have consistently voted for abortion restrictions, including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, and against funding for Planned Parenthood and Title X.A Trump administration may well restrict funding for family planning or abortion in programs overseas to which the United States contributes.ContraceptionIn Congress, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Price and Mr. Pompeo all voted against requiring employers to provide health care plans that included contraception, citing religious liberty.As numerous women\u2019s advocacy groups have demonstrated, high co-payments for birth control have been a significant deterrent for many women.Medicare and MedicaidMr. Price proposes offering states lump sums, known as block grants, for Medicaid. These measures could disproportionately hurt women, particularly poor and minority women, since they would end up reducing the amount of federal money going to the states for health care. Medicaid is the main source of health care for low-income women, providing prenatal and maternity care as well as paying for nursing home care, which affects women more because they live longer. Under Obamacare, federal money to expand Medicaid has helped to narrow a longstanding gap in health care between blacks and whites.Mr. Price has also proposed that the federal government provide a contribution that could be applied to private insurance or Medicare. Some fear those changes would hurt women because they become sicker as they age and would be more likely to exceed a fixed federal contribution.\u201cThey will frame this as flexibility, but it\u2019s about the federal government paying less or making it easier for states to cut back on services,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families.Child Care and paid maternity leaveOne of the few bright spots that women\u2019s advocates see in a Trump administration are proposals championed by Ivanka Trump to require paid maternity leave and offer expanded tax credits for child care. The law now provides only for unpaid leave. Many people working on this issue would prefer paid family leave, to allow men to play a larger role in child rearing. And the child care credits have been criticized as too small and tilted toward higher-income families. But Ms. Smeal said, \u201cGetting something is better than nothing right now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the services covered by grants from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Title X program. The grants, which go to Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics, do not cover abortion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Putin Fan Overseas Pushed Pro-Trump Propaganda to Americans", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byThe Patriot News Agency website popped up in July, soon after it became clear that Donald J. Trump would win the Republican presidential nomination, bearing a logo of a red, white and blue eagle and the motto \u201cBuilt by patriots, for patriots.\u201dTucked away on a corner of the site, next to links for Twitter and YouTube, is a link to another social media platform that most Americans have never heard of: VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook. It is a clue that Patriot News, like many sites that appeared out of nowhere and pumped out pro-Trump hoaxes tying his opponent Hillary Clinton to Satanism, pedophilia and other conspiracies, is actually run by foreigners based overseas.But while most of those others seem be the work of young, apolitical opportunists cashing in on a conservative appetite for viral nonsense, operators of Patriot News had an explicitly partisan motivation: getting Mr. Trump elected.His dabbling in the American presidential election adds an ideological element that has been largely missing from the still-emerging landscape of websites and Facebook pages that bombarded American voters with misinformation and propaganda. Far from the much-reported Macedonian teenagers running fake news factories solely for profit, Mr. Dowson made it his mission, according to messages posted on one of his sites, to \u201cspread devastating anti-Clinton, pro-Trump memes and sound bites into sections of the population too disillusioned with politics to have taken any notice of conventional campaigning.\u201dIn a recent email interview from Belgrade, where he has met with Serbian nationalists, Mr. Dowson explained how his decision to establish an American social media presence was similar to the move into European markets by Breitbart News, the conservative provocateur media operation run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.\u201cSimple truth is that after 40 years of the right having no voice because the media was owned by the enemy, we were FORCED to become incredibly good at alternative media in a way the left simply can\u2019t grasp or handle,\u201d Mr. Dowson said. \u201cBottom line is: BREXIT, TRUMP and much more to follow.\u201dThen there is the added element of Russian meddling. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Moscow put its thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump through the release of hacked Democratic emails, which provided fodder for many of the most pernicious false attacks on Mrs. Clinton on social media.Some analysts see danger signs in the nexus of Russian interests and far-right agitators in Europe and the United States. Social media can amplify even the most obscure voices, giving them a stage from which to broadcast a distorted message to credulous audiences.Russia is particularly adept at playing this game, Ms. Polyakova said. \u201cMoscow specifically encourages and facilitates\u201d the spreading of propaganda through proxies, she said, as well as through events like the Russian conservative forum, which showcases views and narratives favored by the Putin government.At the inaugural forum in March 2015, Mr. Dowson praised Mr. Putin as a strong defender of traditional values, while belittling President Obama and the United States itself as \u201cfeminized men.\u201d In the email interview, Mr. Dowson said he was not supported by Russia in any way, and he accused critics of trying to tar conservatives as dupes of Moscow.\u201cI look on this rebirth of McCarthy-type anti-Russian hysteria by the LEFT as a hilarious reaction born out of the left\u2019s inability to realize THEY elected Trump, not me, not the Russians, not even the right,\u201d he said via email.Formerly a church minister in Northern Ireland and the father of nine, he became involved in anti-abortion campaigns, joined the British National Party in the mid-2000s and, later, founded Britain First, a stridently anti-immigrant group opposed to what it called a creeping Islamic threat to traditional British values. He publicly split with the group in 2014 after some of its leaders started invading mosques and threatening Muslims, which he criticized as un-Christian and counterproductive.For Mr. Dowson, such activities are in keeping with his philosophy that traditional Christian values are under siege because of feckless leadership by America and European powers. The success of Mr. Trump, he said, is the logical result of voters\u2019 rejection of the weakness of global elites.\u201cWe have the ability to take a video from today and put it in half of every single household in the United States of America, where these people can for the first time learn the truth, because their own media tell lies, they tell lies about Russia,\u201d Mr. Dowson said then.\u201cWe have to use popular culture to reach into the living rooms of the youth of America, of Britain, France, Germany, and bring them in,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we can get them the message.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Potential Hitch in Zuckerberg\u2019s Stock Plan for Facebook", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorMark Zuckerberg wants to give away nearly all his stake in Facebook, and yet still keep control of the company he helped found. What\u2019s a tech billionaire to do?The neat solution to this problem \u2014 creating a new class of shares \u2014 is par for the course for Silicon Valley, but often gives other shareholders short shrift.With the birth of his daughter last year, Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to transfer 99 percent of his wealth to a company he controls with his wife, which would later donate that money to charity. In giving away his shares, however, he would have to confront the issue of giving up his voting control over Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg currently owns about 15 percent of Facebook, but because most of his stock is Class B shares with 10 votes apiece, he has voting control of the company with 53.8 percent of the votes, a number brought up to about 60 percent of the votes since he also has the ability to vote the shares held by Dustin Moskovitz.If Mr. Zuckerberg fulfilled even part of his giving pledge, which included the donation of $1 billion a year over the next three years, it would mean coming close to losing his control of the company he founded.So he turned to a tried and true strategy: Follow Google.Shareholders hated it and only 12.7 percent of the regular shareholders voted for it, but Mr. Page and Mr. Brin used their control to push it through.The gain for other shareholders is not immediately obvious. The best you could say is that it continues bonding the two founders to Google\u2019s success.At Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg proposed the same structure to his board.Given the clear conflict, a special committee of independent directors was formed, made up of Marc Andreessen, Erskine Bowles and Susan Desmond-Hellmann. These directors were technically independent of Mr. Zuckerberg, though Mr. Andreessen had done business with Facebook. Each was dependent on Mr. Zuckerberg to elect them to the board each year. The committee hired their own law firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, and the investment bank Evercore.This independent committee approved the new stock structure. Under the plan, both Class A and Class B shareholders will receive a dividend of two nonvoting Class C shares, which have equivalent economic value to the Class A and Class B.At face value it appears that everyone is being treated equally, but the deal really benefits Mr. Zuckerberg. With a dividend of over 900 million Class C shares, he can now sell his Class C shares and not reduce his voting control. The net effect of the transaction is that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Class B shares will account for only 5 percent of Facebook\u2019s equity but will have voting control over Facebook. It ensures that Mr. Zuckerberg will have lifetime control over Facebook.It\u2019s a nice deal for Mr. Zuckerberg, but there are potential risks for shareholders. One need only look at Viacom, where the share voting power is held by Sumner Redstone, who is 93 and apparently in poor health. Mr. Zuckerberg may be a genius and capable of operating Facebook now. But he could live to his 90s, and like Mr. Redstone no longer be as capable, instead preferring to assert control simply because he can.And, sure, Facebook pumps out cash like a fire hose, but some check on management would be prudent to avoid the temptation to waste that money on foolhardy projects. (Google Glass, anyone?)This time around, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may have hit pay dirt.As part of discovery in the case, the lawyers have obtained text messages between Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Zuckerberg that appear to show that Mr. Andreessen was leaking information and helping the chief executive while the independent committee was considering this transaction. The text messages were disclosed in a filing made public a few weeks ago.As the special committee was deliberating, Mr. Andreessen \u2014 who was supposed to be representing Facebook shareholders \u2014 appeared to be coaching Mr. Zuckerberg in how to deal with the special committee.According to the filing, Mr. Andreessen texted Mr. Zuckerberg ahead of a meeting to speak beforehand. Lawyers for the shareholders contend that this was to give Mr. Zuckerberg \u201cinside information,\u201d including coaching him on the question of how long he could leave to do government service and still maintain control. And during meetings with the board, Mr. Andreesen sent messages like, \u201cThis line of argument is not helping,\u201d ending with a smiley face, and \u201cNOW WE\u2019RE COOKING WITH GAS.\u201dThese are pretty bad text messages, though Facebook\u2019s lawyers will most likely have an explanation along the lines that this is just the way bargaining works in Silicon Valley.A representative of Facebook declined to comment but referred me to a statement given to Bloomberg that said, \u201cFacebook is confident that the special committee engaged in a thorough and fair process to negotiate a proposal in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders.\u201dThere are a few lessons here even for internet titans.First, do we really have to say in 2016 that you should assume anything you text or email is public? Really?Second, the committee, if we put aside Mr. Andreessen for a moment, seems to have been doing their job in at least thinking about the big issues, particularly Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s government service. And in exchange for putting this new plan into effect, Mr. Zuckerberg did give up something gigantic: He no longer can pass along control to his heirs or simply retire and keep his high vote stock. Now he will have to work at the company to keep control, an important get for the independent committee.The real question here is what Mr. Andreessen was thinking. The committee would probably have come to the same conclusion no matter what, given Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s importance to and control of the company, but at least there was some back and forth.One might guess that Mr. Andreessen was trying to curry favor with Mr. Zuckerberg. His venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, did help sell both Instagram and Oculus investments to Facebook, after all.But given Mr. Andreessen\u2019s great prominence as a venture capitalist, there really was no need to pander like that. And indeed, the more likely explanation is that he thought it was no big deal.Andreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Such an attitude is all too common in Silicon Valley when it comes to corporate governance and lawyers.The text messages that have emerged in this litigation may not change the ultimate outcome. The stock plan is something that Mr. Zuckerberg wants, and Facebook will do what it can to make it happen, even if it includes writing a big check to settle with the shareholders.In addition, the record will most likely show real bargaining by the committee and a real change in governance given Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s giving up control if he doesn\u2019t work.And the company can just reconvene the independent committee and try again \u2014 or even just move out of Delaware, where Facebook is incorporated, to a friendlier state.If Facebook were going public today with such a share-class structure, few investors would bat an eye. Let\u2019s see what happens when Snap goes public. No doubt there will be a very firm structure that ensures Evan Spiegel, 26, maintains control for the rest of his life.That\u2019s too bad. I suppose the foolish view would be that if Mr. Zuckerberg was really good for the long term then he shouldn\u2019t care about share voting control. No one would try to oust him if he were doing a good job. But that is na\u00efve, no doubt.Instead, the message of Facebook is that in Silicon Valley, founders will keep control of their companies no matter what.

Trump on a tour of blighted neighborhoods in Detroit during the presidential campaign, including his boyhood home, has been chosen by Mr. Trump to oversee one of the government\u2019s main efforts to lift American cities as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was an early endorser of Mr. Trump after ending his own presidential bid.\u201cBen Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement Monday morning. \u201cWe have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities.\u201d\u201cBen shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a presidency representing all Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cHe is a tough competitor and never gives up.\u201dWith no experience in government or running a large bureaucracy, Mr. Carson, 65, publicly waffled over whether to join the administration. He will oversee an agency with a $47 billion budget, bringing to the job a philosophical opposition to government programs that encourage what he calls \u201cdependency\u201d and engage in \u201csocial engineering.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.He has no expertise in housing policy. Raised by a dauntless mother with a grammar-school education who sometimes turned to the government for food assistance, he stressed in his autobiography that individual effort, not government programs, was the key to overcoming poverty.The Department of Housing and Urban Development oversees programs that provide vouchers and other rental assistance for five million low-income families, fights urban blight and helps struggling homeowners stave off foreclosures.The rule, known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, was years in the making and designed to end decades-old segregation by offering affluent areas incentives to build affordable housing. Critics, including Mr. Carson, called it government overreach.Barbara Sard, a former official at the housing department during President Obama\u2019s first term, said Mr. Carson\u2019s view was a misunderstanding of the regulation and its origin in the 1968 Fair Housing Act. The rule also included development funds for poor neighborhoods.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to understand that extending access to opportunity includes improving conditions in racially concentrated neighborhoods,\u201d said Ms. Sard, now vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.In a recent television interview, Mr. Carson said that he was prepared to lead the agency because he grew up \u201cin the inner city\u201d and because as a physician in Baltimore he has \u201cdealt with a lot of patients from that area.\u201d\u201cWe cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities,\u201d Mr. Carson told Fox News. \u201cWe have to get beyond the promises and start really doing something. The amount of corruption and graft and things, shell games that are played \u2014 we need to get rid of all that stuff.\u201dBorn into poverty, Mr. Carson was awarded a scholarship to Yale, and by age 33 he was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.He became an author, a philanthropist supporting scholarships for young students, and a conservative star after attacking Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.During his campaign, he expressed a sweeping opposition to many government programs devised to end poverty, which he said had replaced church-based and other community initiatives. \u201cWe the people have the responsibility to take care of the indigent in our society,\u201d he said at a Republican town hall-style event in February. \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s job.\u201dWhen he gained on Mr. Trump in polls last year, Mr. Trump attacked his rags-to-riches biography. Mr. Trump ridiculed his rival\u2019s account of how he nearly committed a stabbing as a youth, a pivotal moment in Mr. Carson\u2019s life story that led to prayer and a calmer temper. \u201cHow stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?\u201d Mr. Trump asked at a rally in Iowa.But after Mr. Carson dropped out of the race in March, he reconciled with Mr. Trump and became a frequent surrogate on television for him. A key moment of building trust was at a debate in February when Mr. Carson missed his cue to take the stage, and Mr. Trump walked out with him to ease the awkwardness, said Armstrong Williams, a close friend of Mr. Carson\u2019s.\u201cThey both have grown,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson has tremendous respect for this man.\u201d\u201cThese guys have been friends, like brothers, forever,\u201d he added.Weeks ago, as Mr. Carson seemed reluctant to join the administration, Mr. Williams was quoted as saying his longtime friend did not want to get in over his head.Mr. Carson said on Facebook at the time that he had told Mr. Trump that \u201cI preferred to work outside of government as an adviser,\u201d but that if asked, he would serve. He signaled the day before Thanksgiving that he was ready to take on the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The announcement was delayed as Mr. Carson, who once had planned to learn to play the organ in retirement, gave himself several days to mull it over.Using information from a close friend of Ben Carson, the nominee for housing secretary, an earlier version of this article misstated that Mr. Carson spent part of his childhood in public housing. The friend, Armstrong Williams, said Monday that Mr. Carson had never lived in government housing.Advertisement"}

A villager came to help, and they ended up falling in love. Ms. Naumova, who worked in business, left her life in Moscow, married the man, Vasily Smirnov, and settled in Uchma, a small village along the Volga that was once a part of a Soviet collective farm. Her husband is a woodworker, and they have started a museum of village life that also honors Prince Constantine, a 15th century monk who became a Russian Orthodox saint.As Ms. Yushko photographed the couple, she discovered there were many people who had fled Moscow and returned to the land. Some had personal reasons, but others were simply disillusioned with Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s materialistic life and its political system. They wanted to establish simple, ecologically-sound lives and share their resources.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the city you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel your life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Yushko said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you move to the village you feel whole and you spend every second with nature and with great people. You work hard, eat healthier food, breathe fresh air and everything changes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Yushko decided to photograph along the Volga River because it is a central symbol of the Russian people, connected to many legends and the setting for great books, poems and paintings. The river, the longest in Europe, is often referred to as Mother Volga. A central character in Ms. Yushko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project, it is rendered through dreamy wide-format photos. Its residents are shown in square images.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Volga River is where you would go to find the soul of Russia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.While others flock to cities for better salaries, the people she documented are often doing the opposite \u00e2\u0080\u0094 moving to places with poor roads, few jobs and at times no electricity. Instead, they are looking \u00e2\u0080\u009cto find things close to their hearts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Yushko said. The people she met grow vegetables, raise goats, build windmills and\u00c2\u00a0are beekeepers. One family invented an interactive tourist business centered on a fairy tale.At times, the photos recall a similar movement in\u00c2\u00a0America\u00c2\u00a0in the1960s. But before any hippies channeled their inner farmer, there was Leo Tolstoy, whom Ms. Yushko studied and fell in love with when she was in school. Later in his life, she said, the celebrated writer renounced materialism, became a vegetarian, worked on his farm and wore only peasant clothes and even made his own shoes. It was a romanticized version of country life.Ms. Yushko believes that if she had not found photography, she might have left her job in Moscow eventually\u00c2\u00a0and ended up on the Volga too. She visits the area often on vacations with her husband, the photographer Arthur Bondar.

One employee cheekily said in a radio interview that she was considering looking into jobs in Iran\u2019s Parliament.The dispute was amplified by the deeper cultural and religious wars roiling Israeli society, with women often on the front line.Describing Ms. Hasson\u2019s experience as \u201chumiliating,\u201d Ms. Michaeli added, \u201cRespectful attire yes, but no to modesty patrols.\u201dOther female workers subsequently reported having been sent home to change clothes, saying they had frequently been allowed into work in the same garments before.Manuel Trajtenberg, another legislator from the Zionist Union, registered his objection on Wednesday after his parliamentary assistant was asked to remove her jacket for inspection. Mr. Trajtenberg took off his own shirt, revealing an underwear vest, and shouted, \u201cYou should all come in burqas, covered up completely,\u201d referring to the face-concealing full Islamic veil and robe.The guards were prepared for Wednesday\u2019s protest.

He accused the departing Obama administration of carrying out a \u201cdisgraceful anti-Israel maneuver.\u201d\u201cThe resolution that was passed by the U.N. yesterday is part of the swan song of the old world that is biased against Israel,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony honoring wounded soldiers and terrorism victims. \u201cBut, my friends, we are entering a new era and, as President-elect Trump said yesterday, that is going to happen a lot faster than people think.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot to imagine an American move that could provoke violence on the ground or just demonstrations on the ground with potential to become violent,\u201d said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy. \u201cAnd that would not only create an Israeli-Palestinian crisis, but it would create a broader Israeli-Arab crisis.\u201d\u201cIsraeli leaders have used American pressure as an excuse to avoid doing something they really don\u2019t want to do but are being pressured to do by coalition members,\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel teaching at Princeton University. If Mr. Trump advances views to the right of Mr. Netanyahu, \u201cthis will put the prime minister in an awkward position with no excuses for not doing what right-wingers want him to do,\u201d Mr. Kurtzer said.Now in his fourth term, Mr. Netanyahu has focused lately on keeping the Palestinian conflict relatively contained while he forges new bonds around the world. He travels widely these days, and has just returned from a trip to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, two predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 a demonstration, he said, of Israel\u2019s transformed global relations. He boasts that so many foreign delegations are coming to Israel that he barely has time to meet them all. Even Fiji, he says, wants him to visit.In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged that his drive to change Israel\u2019s status was incomplete. \u201cWe are on a journey to improve our relations with the countries of the world. It is going to take more time,\u201d he said.But he predicted that friends would rally to Israel after the United Nations vote. \u201cIt could be that the scandalous resolution from last night will expedite that process because this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d he said.For Mr. Netanyahu, the most important goal has been improving Israel\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, not just Egypt and Jordan, with which it has peace treaties, but with Sunni states like Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. While those states still maintain a public reserve about Israel, they have quietly collaborated out of a shared belief that the greater threat is the theocratic Shiite leadership in Iran.But that could quickly change if the Palestinian issue returns to prominence. Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said in a conference call sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars this past week that an embassy move would prompt the Palestine Liberation Organization to withdraw recognition of Israel that was granted as part of the Oslo peace accords.While many Arab leaders have tired of the Palestinian leadership, they may have to respond if their citizens are stirred to outrage. \u201cIf the street\u2019s reactions get too heated, it will be easier for these Arabs to jettison the Israeli relationship than to stand in the way of their own people\u2019s anger,\u201d Mr. Kurtzer said.That may explain why even some conservatives in Israel are nervous that Mr. Trump may push provocative policies. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, known as a hard-liner, said at a recent Brookings conference that there were other pressing issues aside from moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital.Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the United States from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party, doubted that an embassy move would set off a major backlash, but said an invigorated political right could press for more aggressive policies that would.\u201cIf that were to happen, that would create a problem for Netanyahu,\u201d Mr. Shoval said. \u201cNetanyahu basically does not want to annex all of the West Bank, does not want to rule over the Palestinians. He realizes the risks of that from Israel\u2019s point of view.\u201dStill, some allies of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s, including Mr. Shoval, argue that common interests will still matter more than momentary flare-ups of the longstanding Palestinian conflict.\u201cEven when you forge new alliances, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be in sync on every issue,\u201d said Dore Gold, a longtime adviser to Mr. Netanyahu who recently stepped down as director general of the Foreign Ministry. \u201cThings go on inside Arab countries that we don\u2019t agree with, and things go on inside Israel that they don\u2019t agree with. But the fundamental interests are aligning.\u201dSome analysts said it might depend on how new initiatives were presented. Ehud Yaari, a commentator on Arab affairs on Israel\u2019s Channel 2, said moving the embassy would not lead to serious problems with Sunni states beyond ritualistic protests. American encouragement of settlement construction in new areas \u201cwould prove much harder for the Sunni leadership to swallow,\u201d he said.Even so, Mr. Yaari added, \u201cArab public opinion may force rulers to demonstrate objections, but it seems they are all relieved to see Obama go and do not want to start on the wrong foot with Trump.\u201dOthers suggested that nuanced diplomacy by Mr. Trump could help Mr. Netanyahu. While the right may press for more settlement construction, the Trump administration could endorse keeping any new housing within established blocs, said Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\u201cThat would be a major victory for Netanyahu,\u201d Mr. Satloff said. \u201cAnd if linked to real suspension of growth outside the blocs, it may even advance Israeli ties with Sunnis.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Equally important was Ms. Holzer\u2019s \u201cbypassing the conventions of galleries and museums and taking conceptual art to the street.\u201d It was a lesson he hopes today\u2019s activist-minded artists will take to heart.In keeping with the spirit behind these posters\u2019 origins, Mr. Alden explained that he didn\u2019t ask for permission from Ms. Holzer or her gallery, Cheim & Read, to stage the show, which runs through Feb. 12. The posters, most of which are for sale, come from his own collection of art ephemera, many purchased in the late 1970s and early \u201980s when leftovers from Ms. Holzer\u2019s street campaigns would be sold at shops like Printed Matter, 10 posters for $10. (These posters can now fetch over $1,000 each.)Ms. Holzer said she was intrigued by the exhibition of her earliest work and had no intentions of stopping it. Her original aim in 1977 was fairly modest. Then attending the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s Independent Study Program, she said, she was so daunted by the director Ron Clark\u2019s reading list that she rewrote it as one-liners which became posters. \u201cI wanted to see if these ideas \u2014 as contradictory as they could be \u2014 might be capable of stopping people in their tracks and having them muse over them,\u201d she recalled. Passers-by began writing responses on the posters \u2014 call it proto-social media. \u201cThere was some voting, pre-Facebook \u2018likes\u2019,\u201d Ms. Holzer said. \u201cPeople would star things or underline parts. Sometimes I would come back around and stand close enough to listen to people argue over them.\u201dMs. Holzer\u2019s message to young artists seeing this work for the first time is: \u201cDo it yourself, do it now,\u201d she said, noting the enduring visual power of a simple run of street posters. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard and I was only arrested once,\u201d putting up posters at 3 a.m. in SoHo, she added, and chuckled. Tossed into the back of a police car, \u201cI launched into a rambling explanation and they decided I was not worth keeping,\u201d she said. \u201cI was dripping with so much wheat paste they probably didn\u2019t want me on their back seat much longer.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a gallery. It is Cheim & Read, not Cheim & Reid.\u201cREJOICE!

{"Headline": "In Israel, Arrest of Arab Lawmaker Stokes Debate on Loyalty", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBasel Ghattas, 60, a magazine publisher who joined the Knesset in 2013, was taken into custody by the police just hours after agreeing to surrender his legislative immunity. Such a move is extremely rare in Israel, although in recent years a former prime minister and a president have been charged with corruption and rape and later sent to prison.\u201cAnyone who smuggles cellphones to imprisoned murderers understands that their use could lead to further acts of terror and murder and is therefore dangerous to the public and belongs behind bars,\u201d Gilad Erdan, the public security minister, said on Israel radio.In a video he posted on his Facebook page before his arrest on Thursday, Mr. Ghattas said he had agreed to accept his immunity being lifted a day after a legislative committee voted unanimously to do so, but denied the allegations against him. He said that his continuous efforts to assist prisoners was a personal commitment and he did not regret anything he had done.This fall, some Arabs in the Knesset boycotted the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former president and prime minister who helped negotiate the Oslo peace accords, to protest his policies supporting settlement construction in the West Bank and authorizing military action that killed civilians in Lebanon.Arabs represent about one-fifth of Israel\u2019s population and frequently struggle with questions about the actions of their country while facing whispered doubts about their fidelity to the state. Many identify with the grievances of Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank.Mr. Ghattas, a member of the Joint List alliance of predominantly Arab parties, served as director and publisher of Malakom, an Arabic language magazine about economics, from 2007 to 2012 and still writes regularly for it. He also helped start two foundations to support Arabs with disabilities and Arab university students in Britain.Shuli Moalem-Refaeli, a lawmaker from the Jewish Home party, said the members from one of the Arab parties \u201chave committed treason against the State of Israel time after time.\u201dMr. Ghattas was recorded on video delivering cellphones, SIM cards and documents to prisoners convicted of murder or other violent crimes, according to Israeli media reports. But as his fate was debated this week, Mr. Ghattas railed against what he called the bias of the authorities and said he had voluntarily answered questions.\u201cThere is no doubt that this extreme step, its timing and character, match the populist sound waves of House committee members,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Her sister blasted Rachmaninoff on a tape deck in their shared bedroom while her father favored radio stations that played Irish rebel and folk songs. Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Callaghan started photographing musicians at Dazed & Confused magazine in London and always found herself drawn to the rhythm section, whose performance she found \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost like a dance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you choose to be a drummer, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the one who gets there 20 minutes early to set up your kit, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the one who leaves last as well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou really have to be dedicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer previous long-term photography projects were also about communities. For her first book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHide That Can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she spent four years photographing the men of Arlington House, a hostel in the Camden area of London. After that, she spent five years photographing residents of the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.In 2011, over dinner with an old friend, Sarah Lowe, and her husband, Jim Sclavunos, the drummer for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, she finally set her sights on drummers and started compiling a list of around two dozen she dreamed of photographing. Over the next year, Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Callaghan slowly made her way through it, arranging portrait sessions for what she then assumed would become a magazine feature. When she met the celebrated jazz drummer Roy Haynes at Ronnie Scott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jazz Club in London, however, she knew she needed to broaden her scope.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was telling so many fantastic stories, I decided then and there I had to start recording and interviewing people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat added a whole new dimension to the project.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe started out photographing the drummers at their kits wherever they agreed to meet her. But as she realized her project was becoming a book, she grew determined to meet the musicians, as often as possible, at their homes, where she figured the idiosyncratic environments would provide further insights into their personalities.From there, her photos became more diverse. She started photographing objects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kenny Wollesen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turntable, for instance, and Dave Lombardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s metronome \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that encapsulated her subjects\u00e2\u0080\u0099 aesthetics. In her portraits, she sometimes left the drums behind altogether. Her photo of the jazz drummer Jack DeJohnette, for instance, shows him playing the piano. Jim Black is pictured strumming a guitar. In her photo of Bryan Devendorf of the National, he stands open-armed on the beach, no instrument in sight.Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Callaghan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project also came to incorporate landscapes. When she interviewed Jack White at Third Man Records in Nashville, he mentioned that he loved hearing the sound of the train passing by the building, a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctimeless thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told her, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou almost think shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Callaghan visited the city again a few years later, she took a photo of the train, which now appears in the book.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still capturing a real sense of what that person is about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gives a much fuller story.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough the people in her book live all over the world and often inhabit different musical worlds, Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Callaghan said they could seem part of one big tribe, in which certain bands and their drummers are words in a shared language. Mr. White, Steven Drozd, Julie Edwards and Jody Stephens all name John Bonham, Led Zeppelin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drummer, as an influence, for instance.Still, the interviews in the book speak to a variety of musical philosophies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnybody has the capacity to be a great drummer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Patrick Carney of the Black Keys\u00c2\u00a0said, so long as they play with the right people. But the R&B drummer James Gadson thinks the job requires a special sort of personal alchemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople used to say \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either you got it, or you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gadson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rhythm, and what comes from that is an aura.

For those reasons, the opposition, anti-establishment Five Star Movement has already called Mr. Gentiloni \u201cRenzi\u2019s avatar.\u201dMr. Gentiloni, a journalist, has long worked in center-left parties. A communications minister in Romano Prodi\u2019s government until 2008, he has been in charge of Italy\u2019s foreign affairs for two years.He has advocated international support to stop violence in Libya and help for migrants who gather on those shores before risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean. This year, he lobbied with the Egyptian government to find out who was responsible for the death of a young Italian researcher in Cairo.In his brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni said he would work to clarify Italy\u2019s new electoral rules \u201cwith the necessary promptness.\u201d Disputes over the laws are a central obstacle to the country\u2019s holding a new election.In late January, Italy\u2019s Constitutional Court is scheduled to issue a much-awaited verdict on the current system, which may face an overhaul.Most of the opposition parties are calling for elections soon after, a year ahead of the due date in spring 2018. But Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, noted at the end of his consultations with Italy\u2019s political leaders that the Democratic Party still held a parliamentary majority.The decision whether and when to call elections, then, will rest in the hands of Mr. Mattarella. Mr. Renzi has all but vanished from Italy\u2019s political scene.Soon after moving boxes of \u201cbooks, clothes and notes\u201d out of Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister\u2019s residence, Mr. Renzi repeated that he had kept his promise to step aside if he lost the referendum, writing in a long Facebook post from his hometown in Tuscany. He also pledged to try again to reunite the country.\u201cOnly those who change can help a country as beautiful and difficult as Italy,\u201d he said, acknowledging his mistakes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$25 Million in Breakthrough Prizes Given in Science and Math", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byThis year\u2019s winners include five molecular biologists who won $3 million each for work in genetics and cell biology, one mathematician, a trio of string theorists who split one $3 million physics prize, and another 1,015 physicists working on the LIGO gravitational wave detector split a special $3 million physics prize. In addition, there were six smaller \u201cNew Horizons\u201d prizes totaling $600,000 for 10 \u201cearly career\u201d researchers, and a pair of high school students won $400,000 apiece for making science videos.The Breakthrough Foundation was founded by Sergey Brin of Google; Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe; Jack Ma of Alibaba and his wife, Cathy Zhang; Yuri Milner, an internet entrepreneur, and his wife, Julia Milner; and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan.It sprang from Mr. Milner\u2019s decision in 2012 to hand out $3 million apiece to nine theoretical physicists, in the belief that physicists are equal to rock stars and deserve to be paid and celebrated like them. Over the years, as more sponsors have joined, the prizes have spread to life sciences and mathematics. The winners each year are chosen by a committee of previous winners.For the last few years, the awards have been given out in an Oscar-style ceremony held at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, with a variety of Hollywood celebrities, who this year include Morgan Freeman, Alicia Keys and Jeremy Irons.There were two physics prizes awarded this year.According to string theory, all the forces and particles of nature are composed of tiny little wriggling strings. In 1995, Dr. Polchinski showed that the theory also contains objects of two dimensions or more, called \u201cbranes,\u201d short for membranes. This led to a whole new branch of cosmology, in which branes could be island universes floating in an extra-dimensional space like leaves in a fish tank, colliding and otherwise interacting with each other through a higher dimension.In a celebrated calculation in 1996, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Vafa used string theory to compute the information content, or entropy, of a black hole. Their result verified a prediction made by Stephen Hawking using more approximate methods that black holes would leak radiation and eventually explode.Some recent work includes a \u201cdecoupling theorem\u201d \u2014 a sort of very abstract generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applied to oscillating waves like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proven by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter of Indiana University shows similar relationships in the superposition of waves.Dr. Elledge has described DNA as being constantly under attack but having the ability \u2014 he calls it a sort of chemical intelligence \u2014 to monitor its own integrity and activate various defense mechanisms.His research interests range far and wide. In 2015, he and his team reported that they had developed a test that, using less than a drop of blood, could reveal nearly every virus a person had ever been exposed to. Other scientists saw vast potential in the test, suggesting it could be used to track patterns of disease across populations and to learn more about how viruses, and the body\u2019s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer.Dr. Noller is a biochemist and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to obtain the first image of the ribosome\u2019s molecular structure. His work also helped show that ribosomes are ribozymes, a type of RNA molecule that can facilitate chemical reactions. In this case, the ribozymes stitch amino acids together to build proteins.The Wnt signaling pathway is found in every branch of the animal kingdom. It is involved in things as diverse as setting off breast cancer in mice and helping orchestrate the body plan of fruit flies. It has become an important part in many aspects of biology because the molecular cascade it sets off affects the growth of the entire ecosystem of the body.But insight into its inner workings may provide a way to combat its progression. Dr. Zoghbi\u2019s findings have helped provide the groundwork to fighting the disease.Dr. Zoghbi also helped uncover the culprit behind another neurodegenerative disease, Rett syndrome. This crippling condition mostly affects young girls and is often fatal. There are fewer than 1,000 cases a year in the United States. Her team searched for the cause behind the malady for 16 years, eventually identifying it as a mutation in the gene MECP2. By identifying the gene, she also found that it plays a part in other neurological disorders, providing a starting point to fighting the diseases.Organelles, proteins and other molecules inside the cell are constantly becoming damaged or worn out, especially as the cell divides. If too much rubbish builds up, it can become toxic and kill the cell. Autophagy is also a tool that the cell uses to refuel itself if it is starving.During autophagy, the cell produces internal garbage bags called autophagosomes that capture waste. The autophagosomes are sealed by a double membrane that keeps in the junk. They then fuse with organelles called lysosomes, which carry enzymes that help dissolve whatever is inside.Researchers think that failures in autophagy could contribute to Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also think it could help us better understand the process of aging.In addition to the big $3 million prizes, there were six $100,000 New Horizons prizes \u2013 half in physics and half in mathematics. The young physics winners are: Asimina Arvanitaki of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, Peter Graham of Stanford and Surjeet Rajendran of the University of California, Berkeley, who split one prize; Simone Giombi of Princeton and Xi Yin of Harvard who split another prize; and Frans Pretorius of Princeton.In mathematics, the New Horizons winners were Mohammed Abouzaid of Columbia University; Hugo Duminil-Copin of the University of Geneva; and Benjamin Elias of the University of Oregon and Geordie Williamson of Kyoto University.Advertisement"}

Resolution on Israeli Settlements", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump\u2019s forceful intervention was a rare effort by a new president to shape international events even before taking office. While new presidents typically refrain from weighing in on current issues during the interregnum between their election and inauguration, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement underscored that he does not plan to wait for the swearing in.Mr. Trump said flatly that he should. \u201cAs the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\u201d the president-elect said. \u201cThis puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201dMr. Trump amplified his position by posting the statement on Facebook and Twitter as well, but a transition official insisted on anonymity to confirm the president-elect\u2019s conversation with Mr. Sisi because of the sensitivity of the matter. Mr. Trump\u2019s words echoed the positions expressed by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a breath of fresh air after years of clashes with Mr. Obama.Mr. Netanyahu cited that history on Thursday. \u201cI hope the U.S. won\u2019t abandon this policy,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it will abide by the principles set by President Obama himself in his speech in the U.N. in 2011 \u2014 that peace will come not through U.N. resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties.\u201dA Palestinian delegation traveled to Washington this month to urge Mr. Obama\u2019s team to support the anti-settlement resolution or at least abstain. Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers did not disclose a position and were holding out until the vote to watch how the matter developed. The Palestinians were unable to meet with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and expressed disappointment on Thursday with his position. \u201cA veto means support of settlement activities,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said after the resolution was pulled. \u201cA veto means abandoning the two-state solution and peace efforts.\u201dAsked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, a visibly upset Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said, \u201cHe is acting on behalf of Netanyahu.\u201dEgypt backed off on the resolution after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government put pressure on Mr. Sisi\u2019s government to withdraw it, shortly before Arab ambassadors meeting at the United Nations endorsed it.Mr. Netanyahu treated the pending United Nations vote as a crisis, staying up late into the night discussing it with aides and posting on his own Twitter account, at 3:28 a.m. local time, a message urging Mr. Obama to veto what he called the \u201canti-Israel\u201d resolution. \u201cThe Israelis leaned on the Egyptians this morning to postpone the vote, and the Egyptians basically caved,\u201d said a Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the matter.Arab officials met in Cairo on Thursday night to consider their next move. \u201cThe negotiations over the Arab proposal for the Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territories are still not finished at both the United Nations and the Arab League\u2019s anti-occupation committee,\u201d said Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, according to Egyptian state news.If the White House had let the resolution pass, it would have been a symbolic blow to the diplomatic shield that the United States has always offered Israel. It would also have sent a strong signal of international disapproval over the construction of settlements, regarded by many as illegal under international law.A former top Obama adviser suggested that the president should consider supporting the resolution because settlements are an obstacle to peace and therefore the real damage to Israel. \u201cThe resolution is about settlements, not negotiations,\u201d Martin Indyk, a former special envoy under Mr. Obama, wrote on Twitter. \u201cVetoing would mean vetoing US policy on settlements.\u201dBut Aaron David Miller, another former Middle East peace negotiator, said supporting the resolution would have plunged the administration into an issue that the past several administrations had avoided: the legality of the settlements.\u201cThe problem with voting for this,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cis that Trump will disavow it and U.S. credibility on the issue will again be undermined, not to mention what the Israelis might do on the ground in response, to which the new administration may acquiesce.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Jerusalem, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.

{"Headline": "All the Fake News That Was Fit to Print", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byIn the past, governments, mainstream institutions and newspapers manipulated news and information. Today, anyone with a Facebook account can do it. Instead of the carefully organized fake news of old, there is now an anarchic outflow of lies. What has changed is not that news is faked, but that the old gatekeepers of news have lost their power. Just as elite institutions have lost their grip over the electorate, so their ability to define what is and is not news has also eroded.Politics has always relied on more than just facts about the world. It rests also an ideological framework through which to interpret facts. Consider some of the big questions that may dominate the early Trump presidency. Should there be a registry of Muslims? Should undocumented workers be deported? Is torture acceptable? Should abortion be made illegal?I oppose any registry of Muslims, reject torture, condemn mass deportations and support abortion rights. I do so not simply because of empirical facts but because there are certain political and philosophical beliefs I hold that run deeper than facts; beliefs about rights, values and what it is to be human. If the facts showed that torture worked, I would still oppose it. The fact that medical advances have made it possible for a premature fetus to survive outside the womb at a younger age does not change my view of abortion.This does not mean that I am driven more by emotion that by fact. It means rather that, when it comes to politics, facts make sense only within an ideological framework.In the past, those frameworks were constructed largely out of the political divide between left and right. Each provided a different ideological lens through which to look at the world, interpret the same facts differently and come to different conclusions about policy.Today, those political frameworks have fragmented and are shaped more by identity than by ideology. The key fault line today is not between left and right but between those who welcome a more globalized, technocratic world, and those who feel left out, dispossessed and voiceless.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters and his liberal critics fall on different sides of this new divide. Many Trump supporters see their economic precariousness and political voicelessness as a result of globalization and immigration. Many liberals see such voters as \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Both sides interpret facts and news through their own particular political and cultural frames.More important, social media have not created a fragmented world. They merely reflect and amplify one that already exists, a world in which the authority of traditional institutions has eroded, in which old vehicles of political change have disappeared and in which there is often a welling of anger without a conventional political outlet.If the problem of fake news is more complex than is commonly suggested, the solutions offered are often worse than the problem itself. There are demands that Facebook should censor feeds and weed out fake stories, and for the law to come down hard on those who promote lies. But who should decide what is fake and what isn\u2019t?Do we really want Mark Zuckerberg, or the United States government, to determine what constitutes truth? Do we really want to go back to the days when the only fake news was \u201cofficial\u201d fake news?Fake news is a problem. But we should not exaggerate its newness, misunderstand its cause or promote cures worse than the disease.An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the Hillsborough disaster. It was 1989, not 1987.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Violence and Division on Chicago\u2019s South Side", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Supported byOpinionThe next day about 20 protesters with the group Black Lives Matter Chicago showed up at the scene of the shooting, in the far southwest neighborhood of Mount Greenwood. A crowd of hundreds of white counterprotesters formed to meet them. Geographically, Chicago is starkly divided by race, with most whites living on the North Side. But Mount Greenwood, a holdout from the pre-white flight era, is a rare exception. A predominantly white and heavily Irish Catholic enclave, it is wedged between the suburbs and the sprawling black South Side.What unfolded there after the shooting contained all the zero-sum racial anxieties, distrust and misdirected anger that propelled Mr. Trump to the White House. The proximity of the two sides in the pitched battles on Chicago\u2019s South Side magnified the already exaggerated divisions; it may also make surrendering them that much harder.Municipal workers are required to live within city limits, and Mount Greenwood, 14 miles and 100 blocks south of the Loop, is about as far as you can go and still be in Chicago. It\u2019s home to many police officer and firefighters. While Chicago as a whole voted 84 percent for Hillary Clinton, Mount Greenwood came in at 60 percent for Mr. Trump.People there will tell you that Mount Greenwood is a model for the imagined restoration in Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d The median income is roughly twice the city average. The main shopping district, along 111th Street, maintains a bygone five-and-dime feel, lined as it is with hardware and shoe shops and shamrock-adorned bars. There\u2019s a hockey rink and a store called South Side Irish Imports. Blue ribbons honoring police officers are tied to lampposts. \u201cThe crime rate is low, we have hardworking people and we go to church together,\u201d said a resident who identified himself only as \u201can American.\u201d \u201cThis neighborhood should be an example for everyone.\u201dLike whites across rural America, the Midwest and the South, many Mount Greenwood residents see Black Lives Matter activism of the sort that marched into their neighborhood after Mr. Beal\u2019s shooting as a personal assault. On message boards, residents said they wouldn\u2019t allow their community to be torn up the way Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore had been. That afternoon they surrounded the marchers, shouting, \u201cBlue lives matter\u201d and \u201cJustice well served.\u201dMen with German shepherds followed the retreating protesters, while bikers roared their engines. It looked at times like a performance of whiteness out of Chicago\u2019s past, as when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marched in the white neighborhood of Marquette Park and was brought to his knees by a heaved rock, 50 years ago last July. \u201cGo fix your own neighborhood,\u201d they yelled in Mount Greenwood \u2014 a pointed charge in a city that has seen more than 735 homicides this year, more than in any other American city, with a majority of them in black communities.That night, a 30-year-old black organizer and pastor named Jedidiah Brown called for a second Mount Greenwood action Nov. 8, the night of the election. He urged people to vote before coming out to 111th Street, believing that news of Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory would arrive as a repudiation of what he called a \u201cmob of white thugs.\u201dWord of the rally spread online on Mount Greenwood community pages and on the websites Blue Lives Matter and Chicago Code Blue. The counterprotest was even larger this time, unrulier and more hostile. Mr. Brown shouted into a bullhorn, \u201cIf we agree that black lives matter and blue lives matter, then what are we fighting for?\u201dBack in March, he\u2019d helped force the cancellation of a Trump rally in Chicago, rushing the stage and skirmishing with supporters. He said afterward that the Trump message \u201cdoesn\u2019t work here.\u201d But he was wrong about the city. \u201cEveryone else in the country has just allowed the riots, violence and destruction of their neighborhoods,\u201d a Mount Greenwood resident wrote on Facebook. \u201cHow did I know that this would be the one place in America to stand up and say no?\u201dThe following week, I went with Mr. Brown to Mount Greenwood to meet with clergymen and politicians, business owners and community members, police officials and representatives from City Hall. By then Mount Greenwood was citywide news: The neighborhood had already hosted peace vigils; after girls at a nearby parochial high school used racial epithets texting about the black protesters, the texts went viral and they were expelled (the girls\u2019 parents are now suing the school district). Chicago\u2019s archbishop, Blase J. Cupich, felt the need to weigh in, declaring, \u201cRacism is a sin.\u201dThe neighborhood\u2019s alderman, Matt O\u2019Shea, said the meetings were about building bridges and opening dialogue. He wanted everyone to see what Mount Greenwood was really about. I\u2019m a white South Sider, though from 50 blocks north of Mount Greenwood, and after the election I wanted desperately to understand the racial and political tensions that were roiling the city and country.What did six hours of dialogue over two days reveal? Any national conversation ahead will be difficult. Both Mr. Brown and Alderman O\u2019Shea were dismissed as sellouts and puppets for working with either \u201cterrorists\u201d or \u201coppressors.\u201d Just as black Chicagoans bristled at Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that they and other minorities in inner cities were all \u201cliving in hell,\u201d those in Mount Greenwood hated that the protests in their community reduced them to caricatures of \u201cwhite supremacists.\u201dA resident who lost her daughter to cancer described how the community rallied to give her child a life at the end that she could never have provided. That, too, was what they meant by \u201cMount Greenwood Strong.\u201d A community member told Mr. Brown: \u201cWe wish you understood where we came from. It\u2019s not just what\u2019s done to you. Every one of us has had things said to us.\u201dMount Greenwood residents didn\u2019t believe they should be held personally responsible for decades of disinvestment in black neighborhoods, for unfair housing practices and enduring structures of racism and inequality. But defending their neighborhood against outsiders, preserving what one man called their \u201csmall country community,\u201d was not something new. In the 1960s, residents opposed the integration of a Mount Greenwood elementary school, with pickets turning violent after days of protest. Reporting on the gauntlet the black students had to run, The Chicago Defender, a leading black newspaper, called the neighborhood \u201cChicago\u2019s \u2018Little Rock.\u2019 \u201d In the 1990s, residents fought the expansion of a magnet high school that would bring more minority students into the neighborhood. Well before Joshua Beal, the community was complaining about black funeral processions, like the one he was part of, passing through. People in and around Mount Greenwood recognize it as contested space.A third protest took place the Sunday before Thanksgiving. Twenty activists denounced police shootings and the failure to hold officers accountable, and about 100 Mount Greenwood residents shouted back, their chants of \u201cC.P.D.\u201d and \u201cU.S.A.\u201d punctuated by \u201cTrump is your president.\u201d I heard a woman yell, \u201cMy grandparents didn\u2019t make anyone pick cotton, so shut up.\u201dThen Mr. Brown, Mr. O\u2019Shea and about 30 others showed up on 111th, arm in arm. Their voices weren\u2019t louder than the din, but they gamely hoisted signs that read, \u201cLet\u2019s Talk.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the most inspiring slogan, but maybe it was an accurate reflection of the caution and uncertainty that many are feeling now.They invited people to join them in the nearby library, where residents and activists ate pizza and a pasta salad that someone warned me against. Those gathered were encouraged to interact with someone who didn\u2019t look like them, and it was announced that a series of dinners were being planned, small affairs in Mount Greenwood homes for people from different parts of the city. \u201cI made some friends here,\u201d Mr. Brown declared.It was a tiny gesture of unity in a divided city and in a country where people are retreating further into their like-minded communities, more certain that their differences with others are irreconcilable. But here on the South Side, at least, there\u2019s no other option but to confront one another.Ben Austen is writing a history of the Cabrini-Green public housing development in Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Multimediated Lives: An Erudite Tour of Digital Culture", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cThe Four-Dimensional Human,\u201d the first book by the British writer Laurence Scott, is a curious entry in the crowded field of tech criticism. The book nimbly ranges across the charged and vexing aspects of digital life \u2014 the gradations of online friendship, trolls, the allure of voyeuristically monitoring old friends \u2014 while also neglecting some of its most fundamental issues. Surveillance is mentioned in passing, privacy appears a dim concern, and there\u2019s hardly a mention of any tech figure not named Zuckerberg or Page. You might finish the book without remembering that essential debates about power, speech and civil liberties are being hashed out not in public but in Silicon Valley boardrooms. At the same time, the economic and political conditions propagated by these companies \u2014 the tremendous income inequality, the progressive commoditization of everyday life and communications \u2014 seem to hover out of view, lending, like a distant moon, some gravity but not much light to the proceedings.Now that we\u2019ve established all the things that \u201cThe Four-Dimensional Human\u201d is not, it\u2019s important to emphasize what it is: namely, a considered perceptual and aesthetic tour through the digital sensorium. Clever, allusive, with a capacious sense of humor, the book sizzles with intelligence. Scott mixes observations of deep profundity and eloquence with some head-scratching notions about digital life. But through it all, \u201cThe Four-Dimensional Human\u201d is sustained by such fine writing, as well as an eclectic palette of references, from Seamus Heaney to schlock horror films, that it\u2019s hard not to be charmed. I don\u2019t share Scott\u2019s belief in \u201cthe miracle of connectedness,\u201d but I do agree that the upheavals of our multimediated lives deserve critical assessment.The book\u2019s principal weakness may be its overarching conceit that we have all somehow become four-dimensional human beings. By this Scott seems to be referring to the many ways in which always-on connectivity, mobile technologies and various databases containing scattered bits of personal information have scrambled our relationship with the world. This proposition seems to call out for a dose of media history, say, by examining the ways in which previous communications technologies, from the telegram to television, contributed to a sense of disembodiment or of time stretching and unfolding in strange new ways.Scott overlooks those kinds of comparisons and instead trains his eye on the modern individual\u2019s relationship to the digital world, its bizarre new folkways and vast sense of possibility. Sometimes this causes him to slip into what feels like an unearned mysticism, marveling, for instance, at \u201cthe strange sorrow that Skype provokes\u201d (by making us feel as if we\u2019re in more than one place at once). His tone can become elegiac and airy: \u201cThe children of digitization will grow up expecting to occupy space robustly and to live prolifically in one another\u2019s rooms. Their strength will be measured, like the density of muscle fibers, according to the knit of their connectedness.\u201d It\u2019s evidence of Scott\u2019s writerly skill that these extended metaphors don\u2019t collapse on themselves. The problem seems to be that Scott pulls off these dazzling analogies all too easily and that, consequently, he gets mired in this discursive mode in which symbols and interpretations pile ever more ponderously on top of one another. A chapter called \u201cA Different Kind of Buzz\u201d manages to draw impressive mileage out of the beehive and its numerous semiotic associations. Along the way, Scott invokes the influence of beehives on Western architecture, Hamlet, Dionysus (\u201cborn, like an accidental text message, of Zeus\u2019 thigh\u201d), the video game series Grand Theft Auto and Marcel Duchamp, to name a few.Another chapter takes \u201cAll That Is Solid Melts Into Air,\u201d Marshall Berman\u2019s study of modernity, as a jumping-off point from which to consider how digital life, like capitalism, can seem immaterial yet ubiquitous and oppressive. The superabundance of content \u2014 endless parodies of cultural products that themselves are borrowed references to previous films, TV shows, jokes, memes or ideas we\u2019ve all experienced a hundred times before \u2014 furnishes \u201cthe sense that life is a collection of likenesses, lived out elsewhere.\u201d The endless categorizing, hash-tagging and liking we engage in is a way of making sense of a world that seems populated by mass-produced variations of familiar themes. We face, then, a \u201ccrisis of originality,\u201d where \u201cthe pressure we feel when writing\u201d something as simple as a Facebook birthday greeting \u201cis the pressure of the artist. How do we make it new?\u201dOne response might be to burrow deeper into the meta-realm of reference and parody. Scott makes an unexpectedly persuasive case for how, in the movie \u201cScream,\u201d Wes Craven cleverly toyed with the very horror clich\u00e9s he helped popularize. Stylized self-consciousness becomes a reasonable response to a lack of substance. Or sometimes the two are one and the same, as Scott finds in the \u201cnormcore\u201d trend, in which the L.L. Bean-and-khaki wardrobes of white suburbanites were appropriated by urban hipsters. The point? Either to disappear into the urban masses or to signal a weary accommodation with a culture exhausted by the feeling that everything had been done before.Whether any of this hangs together for you may depend on your tolerance for the sort of cultural analysis in which a clearly brilliant critic spends pages worrying over subjects that sometimes seem less than worthy of his full attention. This isn\u2019t simply a matter of one\u2019s brow, high or low. Scott\u2019s consideration of Katie Price \u2014 Britain\u2019s Kim Kardashian, an omnipresent media star famous mostly for being famous \u2014 has some interesting things to say about the nature of celebrity, particularly in a social media culture in which we are often encouraged to act like microcelebrities of our own. But he\u2019s on shakier ground when marveling that Yo \u2014 an app whose function is limited to sending a simple \u201cYo\u201d message to a recipient \u2014 \u201cis an early example of style-resistant discourse, its willfully generic exterior containing an infinite variety of meaning.\u201d There may be something funny and even defiant about Yo\u2019s deliberate monotony, but I would pause before claiming that \u201cthis is a noble approach to the problem of continual novelty in a world composed of finite aesthetic possibilities.\u201dThere are other points, too, where Scott gets lost in his thicket of interpretations. He revisits the public downfall of John Galliano, the chief designer for Christian Dior who was caught on video harassing some Jewish patrons in a Paris cafe. Galliano\u2019s scene caused him to be denounced by the actor Natalie Portman, who at the time was the face of a Dior perfume. \u201cThe public violence of Galliano\u2019s outburst,\u201d Scott asserts, reminded the world of Galliano and Portman\u2019s \u201cpositions as individuals in a corporate structure\u201d and ensured that Portman, \u201cas a cracked commodity,\u201d could \u201cno longer maintain the coherent illusion she was paid to enact.\u201d On some higher analytical plane, this may be true, but it seems far more obvious that Portman, as a Jew, felt compelled to dissociate herself from someone who had made ugly anti-Semitic comments.It\u2019s possible to finish \u201cThe Four-Dimensional Human\u201d with the feeling of having contended with a great intellect who hasn\u2019t quite yet found his subject. Scott\u2019s erudition is impressive, as is his ability to catch hold of a cultural reference and worry out the last drops of insight. But his metaphysical vision causes him to neglect the material reality in front of him \u2014 the craven hunger of tech giants for personal data and influence over our decisions; the ways in which today\u2019s innovators have tried to prove their revolutionary bona fides by freighting their inventions with false myth and pathos. There\u2019s little doubt that the internet, writ large, has changed how we live. But to say that we, as human beings, are fundamentally different seems to grant our new digital technologies a kind of sentience and autonomy that they haven\u2019t yet earned.Jacob Silverman is the author of \u201cTerms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Photos, Perhaps, Show a Rare Glimpse of Gauguin in Tahiti", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byPaul Gauguin\u2019s life, especially the years he spent in the South Pacific, has become shrouded in myth and legend, much of it of his own making. But now a Munich art dealer, Daniel Blau, is displaying at a gallery in Paris what he says are the only two known photographs of the artist in French Polynesia, images that \u2014 if the identification is confirmed \u2014 vividly illuminate Gauguin\u2019s true character.The photographs, at the Oceanic art specialist Galerie Meyer until Saturday, date from 1896 and show a man with a striking resemblance to the Post-Impressionist painter attending a festive picnic at Point Venus on Tahiti. In one, a group photo of European men and local women, he is shown wearing a wreath of flowers, hugging two girls, kissing one on the cheek and fondling the other. In the other image, he stares challengingly at the camera.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of photos of white people in the Pacific posing with local girls,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cHe behaves so differently. He\u2019s pretty straightforward and is very involved with the viewer. This is an artist who has something to show.\u201dMr. Blau\u2019s wife, Maria, first made a connection between Gauguin \u2014 whose extroverted personality is extensively documented \u2014 and the man shown in the photographs in 2005, when she and her husband saw the photo of him embracing the girls in a small album of Tahiti and Hawaii images they had bought at auction.In July 2015 two other photograph albums containing that same image, as well as the second full-face photo turned up in an auction at Bayeux Encheres in Normandy. They were cataloged as the work of Jules Agostini, a colonial administrator who is documented as knowing the artist.The first album was bought by the French government under the country\u2019s cultural patrimony law on behalf of the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris; the other was bought by Mr. Blau for 5,875 euros, or about $6,260.\u201cIf these two photographs are actually of Paul Gauguin, then they tell us a great deal about his state of mind and his social entourage during the summer of that year,\u201d said Caroline Boyle-Turner, an art historian, who has included the photos in a new book, \u201cPaul Gauguin & the Marquesas: Paradise Found?\u201dMs. Boyle-Turner says that Gauguin had just left a hospital on Tahiti around the time of the picnic on July 19, 1896, which may well have been part of the island\u2019s protracted Bastille Day celebrations.\u201cGauguin admired and pursued young Polynesian women, as his writings and paintings make clear,\u201d Ms. Boyle-Turner said. \u201cThis photograph shows his high spirits, as well as his human side.\u201d Though she found the evidence for the attribution \u201cvery convincing,\u201d she acknowledged that it remained a subject of academic discussion.A late starter, Gauguin fully devoted himself to painting in his 40s after losing his job as an accountant at a brokerage in the 1882 Paris Bourse crash. He left France for Tahiti in 1891, then moved 10 years later to the even more remote and \u201calmost cannibalistic\u201d (at least, so he dreamed) Marquesas Islands, where, embroiled in disputes with the local colonial authorities, he died in 1903.Philipp Rudolf Humm, another late starter who abandoned a business career, is finding some success as an artist. The 57-year-old Mr. Humm was a top executive at Vodafone and other telecoms before devoting himself last year to painting what he describes as \u201cPop Expressionist\u201d canvases that playfully fuse elements of classicism, Surrealism and popular culture.\u201cCreating something is a bit more of a legacy than managing something,\u201d Mr. Humm said. \u201cMy aspiration is to achieve recognition as an artist, to have works kept by a museum.\u201dEight of his paintings, priced between 8,000 pounds and \u00a39,500, or about $9,950 to $11,800, were displayed at the Riflemaker gallery in London from Nov. 24 through Thursday.\u201cThere\u2019s an element of anti-art that appeals,\u201d said a visitor, Guillaume Andre, 24, who works in digital marketing. Mr. Andre spoke as he examined one of Mr. Humm\u2019s paintings, \u201cThe Apprentices,\u201d which depicts Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons painting Botticelli\u2019s \u201cVenus\u201d from life and was one of three canvases to sell from the show. \u201cHe\u2019s decided to follow his passion. If people like his work and it sells, good on him.\u201dIn Maugham\u2019s \u201cThe Moon and Sixpence,\u201d the stockbroker-turned-artist Strickland is posthumously recognized as a genius. Most of his paintings are acquired by museums, \u201cand the rest are the treasured possessions of wealthy amateurs.\u201dBut can genius still go undetected in today\u2019s art world? Thanks to the interconnectivity of the internet and social media, artists\u2019 reputations are made very quickly. The Romanian painter Adrian Ghenie, 39, for example, was little known until breakthrough exhibitions in 2008 and 2009.At Phillips\u2019s inaugural evening auction of 20th century and contemporary art and design in Hong Kong on Nov. 27, Mr. Ghenie\u2019s small 2009 canvas \u201cElvis\u201d sold for 5.5 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $706,000, more than four times the low estimate. Nine people registered to bid on the 16-inch-high painting.\u201cIn today\u2019s Instagramed, Tweeted and Facebooked world, it\u2019s impossible for an artist of note to die unrecognized and their work be rediscovered,\u201d said Matt Carey-Williams, Phillips\u2019s deputy chairman for Europe and Asia. \u201cArtists are engaging with the digital space as soon as they become students.\u201dAnd if Gauguin were living today? He would have his own much-visited website and Twitter account, and his paintings would be an Instagram and Facebook sensation with the droves of tourists anchoring on cruise ships.For artists of our digitalized day and age, there is no Tahiti.Advertisement"}

On Friday, Mr. Fuller\u2019s company, XIX Entertainment, announced a deal with the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) to produce an English-language version called \u201cShame.\u201dThat approach \u2014 intimate portrayals, letting the digital releases drive the linear TV version, giving each fictional character an Instagram account \u2014 caught the attention of Mr. Fuller.The English-language version will have new characters and actors but use the show\u2019s format, and NRK will consult. Production is expected to start next year. \u201cWe are exploring all content outlets,\u201d Mr. Fuller said in an email. \u201c\u2018Shame\u2019 works across all platforms and that is what gives it a point of difference. We are looking to innovate and push the boundaries of how modern content is viewed and experienced.\u201d (Neither NRK nor XIX would comment on the financial details.)\u201cSkam,\u201d a low-budget operation, was originally created for NRK\u2019s children\u2019s division to draw more young viewers to its site. Now finishing up its third season, it\u2019s become the most-watched web TV show in Norwegian history since it first aired in September 2015, averaging 1.2 million unique visitors a week to the site and more than a million people streaming the weekly TV episode, in a country with a population of five million people. NRK has confirmed it will produce a fourth season.Teaming up with XIX Entertainment is a huge leap. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Julie Andem, 34, the show\u2019s creator, writer and director.Each season of \u201cSkam\u201d centers on one character. Season 3, which wraps up next week, has focused on Isak (Tarjei Sandvik Moe), who is coming to terms with being gay and has fallen for an older boy, Even (Henrik Holm).Isak\u2019s big reveal is quiet and understated. (He comes out to his best friend in person, and to his mother via text message.) In another scene, Isak discusses homosexuality with Sana (Iman Meskini), an observant Muslim classmate who wears a head scarf and doesn\u2019t take flak from anyone.Hardly any adults are present. \u201cI wanted the kids to solve their problems on their own,\u201d Ms. Andem said.The show\u2019s strength is its authenticity, said Cecilie Asker, a television critic for the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. \u201cIf this were a movie and there were a big movie director doing it, they\u2019d make every moment big,\u201d Ms. Asker said. \u201cBut instead, these are small moments, and the realness is in those moments.\u201dTo write \u201cSkam,\u201d Ms. Andem spent half a year traveling around Norway, interviewing teenagers about their lives. \u201cWe found one main need,\u201d she said. \u201cTeenagers today are under a lot of pressure from everyone. Pressure to be perfect, pressure to perform. We wanted to do a show to take away the pressure.\u201dTo get strong performances from first-time actors, Ms. Andem auditioned 1,200 people and created the characters after she cast them. As she writes each episode, she uses feedback from the actors and viewers \u2014 who write comments on NRK\u2019s website, as well as on Facebook and Tumblr fan pages \u2014 to keep the story line believable. They shoot two episodes over three days because most of the actors are still in high school or working other jobs.The characters all have Instagram accounts and there are Facebook pages for some events (but not for fictional characters, which is against Facebook\u2019s rules). When Isak spends a weekend with Even and forgets a friend\u2019s birthday party, the NRK page had text messages that Isak\u2019s friends sent him, asking where he was.\u201c\u2018Skam\u2019 is combining reality and fiction and the line between them isn\u2019t so clear,\u201d said Mari Magnus, 27, the web producer for the show, who writes the text messages and masterminds the Instagram accounts.Ms. Andem said that she was surprised to discover in her research how girls use their sexuality today. \u201cWhen I was 16, we\u2019d use sex to get love,\u201d she said. \u201cThey use sex so they can be more popular on Instagram.\u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good or a bad thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Topped with spires, the finely wrought Gothic-style facade opens onto a soaring space with columns, ornate medieval motifs and a dazzling stained-glass ceiling that hovers over the marquee attraction: a sinewy blood-red double staircase that coils like a strand of DNA.\u201cThe intention was to make an extraordinary building \u2014 a cathedral for the arts and letters,\u201d said an owner, Jos\u00e9 Lello, whose great-grandfather was among the founders.And like a cathedral, the bookshop attracts fervent worshipers \u2014 up to 3,500 a day \u2014 who pay a three-euro fee (about $3.20). Harrison Ford and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, who owns the Manchester City soccer team, were among last summer\u2019s visitors, Mr. Lello said.According to bookshop lore, J. K. Rowling drew inspiration for her young-adult novels from the shop\u2019s creaky interiors while teaching English in Porto in the early 1990s. At least two employees from those days recalled Ms. Rowling as a customer, Mr. Lello said.Matilde Lindberg, the shop\u2019s \u201ctourism coordinator,\u201d said there were \u201cmany similarities between our staircase and the one depicted in the Hogwarts school,\u201d she noted, referring to the academy attended by Harry and his magician friends.On a July afternoon, scores of travelers from Europe, Asia and beyond crowded the shop, while perhaps a hundred more waited outside. Standing near the tiny upstairs cafe \u2014 a three-table affair between books on Portugal tourism and Portuguese cuisine \u2014 two honeymooners from Boston, Kelsey Boyd and Nicholas Mucci, trained their cameras on the shop\u2019s chiseled wood and plaster details. The pair had spent 45 minutes in line in the drizzle, they said, but were happy to wait. \u201cIt\u2019s like a museum in here,\u201d said Ms. Boyd, a longtime Potter fan, comparing the shop to the castles and other monuments they had visited. \u201cIt has that magical feel about it.\u201d\u2014 SETH SHERWOODHANGZHOU, CHINAWhen you walk into the shop, the books appear to reach impossible heights and stretch clear into the distance, an effect created by the perfect symmetry of the dark wooden shelves and the clever use of mirrors on the ceilings and walls. In an amphitheater-like room for readings and lectures, the impression is amplified by the reflection of the curved wall in the mirrored ceiling; it feels as if you are completely surrounded by a rainbow of book spines. In yet another room, the books are arranged on thin columns placed randomly around the room like trees in a forest, with benches interspersed for reading. Again, a mirrored ceiling makes the shelves appear as if they are not just trees, but towering redwoods.Li Xiang, the designer of the store, said the idea was to get young people in the doors and encourage them to linger for hours over a book or a piece of tiramis\u00f9 and an espresso in the bookstore\u2019s cafe. On a recent afternoon, that was precisely what customers were doing; the shop was filled with 20-somethings flipping through novels, not a cellphone in sight.\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be a traditional bookstore; I would rather it be like an art gallery,\u201d Ms. Li said.Hangzhou is revered in China for its misty mountains, tea plantations and the famous West Lake. Ms. Li sought to bring nature into the design, hence the treelike book columns and waterlike reflections.Ms. Li designed a playful kids\u2019 room with animal-shaped chairs and bookshelves shaped like a pirate ship and a twisting roller coaster. School groups come frequently for lectures on Hangzhou\u2019s history and there\u2019s the occasional experimental theater performance and sleepover, when families pitch tents in the store.Ms. Li said she hoped the space inspired children more than the drab bookstores of her youth. \u201cThey were ugly, just full of shelves,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to bring functionality and beauty together so people can enjoy their time in the bookstore.\u201d\u2014 JUSTIN BERGMANPARIS\u201cThat\u2019s what a bookshop should be,\u201d said Adam Biles, the store\u2019s events manager. \u201cNot a museum piece, but a place where people can go to discover new things and new ideas.\u201dAnd then there is the Shakespeare and Company Cafe, which opened next door in October 2015. Beneath shelves of vintage books, visitors can sit with a cappuccino or a slice of gluten-free pie and read undisturbed. Should some need a quieter haven, they can wind their way up the creaky stairs of the main bookshop to the old reading room. Over the doorway, a sign posted by Mr. Whitman has not faded over the years: \u201cBe not inhospitable to strangers, lest they be angels in disguise.\u201d\u2014 LIZ ALDERMANSANTORINI, GREECEAmid the glitz and din of tourist shops on the vacation paradise of Santorini, a whitewashed staircase sinks into the earth. At the bottom, a stone doorway opens onto a Hobbit-like den. Inside lies a hidden treasure: thousands of titles of literature, poetry and short stories, plus children\u2019s books and pre-loved books, sprawled over shelves fashioned from driftwood and discarded pallets culled from junkyards.\u201cThe only thing we care about is that the books are good,\u201d said Craig Walzer, a founder and an American expat. At age 23 he had started the store originally as something of a half joke. Having fallen in love with the island, he filled a van in Cambridge, England, with books and friends and sojourned to the town of Oia, where they procured an empty building facing the russet sunset, installed shelves and books and began operating.Today, the store holds literary festivals with readings by authors. There are musical performances, a film festival and even tzatziki competitions on the terrace, which has a stunning view of the volcanic caldera where Atlantis was believed to have sunk into the sea.Lest vacationers fret about stuffing books into already-crammed suitcases, Atlantis has a solution. Mr. Walzer recently opened a little printing operation in New York making slim handmade titles, from Edgar Allan Poe to Plato, that travelers can have shipped home or to a friend. Copies can also be ordered online for people wishing to send a little slice of Greece or Atlantis to themselves.\u2014 LIZ ALDERMANVICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIAWalking into Munro\u2019s Books, nestled in the quaint Old Town of Victoria, feels a lot like walking into a temple \u2014 an ancient one, perhaps Roman or Greek. That\u2019s partly because of the neo-Classical design of the building, which originally opened in 1909 as a Royal Bank of Canada branch. Much of that d\u00e9cor is still evident, from the impressive columns on its facade to its soaring 24-foot coffered ceiling.But any religious impressions may also be thanks to the couple who have been associated with the space for over 30 years: Jim and Alice Munro \u2014 yes, that Alice Munro, the Nobel Prize-winning author (though the Munros divorced in 1972 and Ms. Munro was never an owner of the store). The store originally opened on nearby Yates Street in 1963, but in 1984 moved into the old bank space and has been a gravitational spot in downtown Victoria ever since.Mr. Munro, who turned the store over to a group of employees in 2014, died last month. But the name surely attracts visitors, as it did me during a visit this past summer. Walking into the grand space, I was struck by the gorgeous wall hangings that rise above the bookshelves like giant imaginative windows. The pieces, by Carole Sabiston, a Canadian textile artist (and Mr. Munro\u2019s second wife), depict the four seasons and classic works of literature.Among the books, Canadiana is unsurprisingly well represented (including an impressive array of First Nations literature and art books), as well as French-language books (\u201cNouveau!\u201d reads a sign on one shelf). After wandering the aisles, though, I soon found myself in a children\u2019s book alcove with my 4-year-old daughter. We sat and played and read and could have stayed for hours.\u2014 DAN SALTZSTEINBUENOS AIRESThe building had been falling into disrepair when it was converted into a bookstore by the El Ateneo chain in 2000; the work was carried out by the studio of the Buenos Aires architect Fernando Manzone, which was careful to leave the majority of architectural flourishes intact. The second and third floors, once balconies and boxes that held an audience, are still supported by ornate pillars and are now lined with books and dotted with comfy chairs for reading. The domed ceiling, frescoed by Nazareno Orlandi, remains. On the ground floor at the very back of the store is the stage, still bedecked with red curtains, and now supporting tables and chairs: This has become a cafe and a good place for foot-weary tourists to down an espresso. The books include works carried by chain bookstores (there\u2019s a small English language section) but the music selection is excellent, a small reminder of the heritage of the Grand Splendid.\u2014 NELL McSHANE WULFHARTMEXICO CITYWith its tall ficus trees and pots of trailing devil\u2019s ivy, El P\u00e9ndulo (52-55-5280-4111) in the upscale district of Polanco is an airy refuge from the incessant urban thrum outside. Bookshelves stretch up the walls of the double-height atrium, and a curving staircase leads to the second-floor gallery, making the place feel more like a library than a store and creating the feeling that you are there to read as much as to shop.The d\u00e9cor is simple and calming: wooden floors, teal paintwork and a corrugated PVC roof that fills the shop with natural light. Should you need more encouragement, there are sofas where you can order coffee and thumb through a book or newspaper. There are other, more contrived invitations to ruminate, such as the pendulum that hangs from the ceiling and trickles sand into a shallow box.As well as having collections of Hispanic literature and literary criticism, there are sections dedicated to books in English, graphic novels and vinyl records. As one fan observed, its careful selections are a sign that \u201cthe people behind the bookstore are readers reaching readers.\u201dAnd reach readers they must. Mexico placed second-to-last in a Unesco survey of more than 100 countries\u2019 reading habits a few years ago; there is just one bookstore in Mexico for every 200,000 inhabitants, compared with, say, one per 8,000 in Spain. Crist\u00f3bal Pera, the director of the Wylie Agency Espa\u00f1a in New York and a former Mexico City resident, said that fact has given rise to a \u201csingular tradition\u201d of bookstores, including El P\u00e9ndulo, that in an effort to lure readers incorporate cafes and lounge areas and serve as cultural hubs.The six P\u00e9ndulo bookstores, all in Mexico City, which go by the moniker \u201ccafebrer\u00eda\u201d (a fusion of \u201ccafe\u201d and \u201clibrer\u00eda\u201d), serve breakfast, snack food and coffee. The food is passable but not memorable. You\u2019d be better advised to work up an appetite with an hour\u2019s reading and then head out to hunt down some real Mexico City fare.\u2014 VICTORIA BURNETTKALK BAY, SOUTH AFRICAThe seaside village of Kalk Bay, about half an hour down the coast from Cape Town, is a quaint hamlet with funky boutiques, fish-and-chips shops and a couple of beloved bookstores.\u2014 SARAH KHANAn article last Sunday about destination bookstores described incorrectly the ownership of Munro\u2019s Books, in Victoria, British Columbia. Jim Munro was the owner until he turned it over to a group of employees, in 2014; his first wife, the author Alice Munro, was never an owner.An article on Dec. 11 about bookstore destinations referred incorrectly to the location of a Chinese bookstore. The bookseller Zhonghuge\u2019s new outlet in Hangzhou, China, is about an hour southwest of Shanghai by train, not east. \u0081Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Color of 2017? Pantone Picks a Spring Shade", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedWhen the question of what will define 2017 comes up, the response most often includes words like \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201cpopulism\u201d and \u201cdivision\u201d and \u201canger.\u201d\u201cGreen\u201d \u2014 not so much.That is, the Color of the Year for 2017.Because, though you may not realize it, it turns out that green has everything to do with all of those other things. Not literally. (Despite the fact that President-elect Donald J. Trump clearly loves green, at least when it comes to dollars, he rarely wears it, and it doesn\u2019t figure much in his decorating sense or what we know of his diet.) But emotionally and imaginatively.That may seem facile as a reading, but, well \u2026 who ever said humanity was subtle? Certainly the psychology of color ranges from the obvious (red represents aggression; pink is swaddling and calms people) to the chiaroscuro.When the Pantone team started noticing the creeping preponderance of green, there was a sense that perhaps it reflected what was regarded earlier this fall as the possibility of a new beginning with the first female president. But in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and the dissension it highlighted, Ms. Eiseman said, green \u201ccould have an even more significant meaning.\u201d\u201cThis particular green is an unusual color: a combination of yellow and blue, or warmth and a certain cool,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex marriage.\u201dWhich is probably putting what is going to have to happen in the current political climate mildly.Pantone started choosing Colors of the Year at the turn of the millennium, in part as a way to demonstrate the psychology around what makes a color take off and to answer the question every fashion person is routinely asked, \u201cWhy is the color ____ so popular this season?\u201dThough the selections serve no direct consumer purpose \u2014 Pantone doesn\u2019t sell any products related to the choices, nor does it license a symbol to other companies to denote they are using the Color of the Year \u2014 and hence the company has no way of measuring the effect of its declaration, the colors have become a sort of windsock for determining which way the national mood is blowing.Certainly, I can attest to the fact that pretty much just minutes after the announcement is made, my inbox is inundated with emails from brands and retailers promoting products available in the Color of the Year. Airbnb was so excited, it is collaborating with Pantone for the first time next year on a Color of the Year \u201cexperience,\u201d transforming one of its listed properties into an immersive greenery environment.You could argue that the selection is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, except the point is that the products are already there (otherwise they couldn\u2019t be marketed so immediately), which supports Pantone\u2019s contention that it has identified a burgeoning trend.The process, which takes about nine months, is highly subjective, as Pantone admits, and more about instinct than science. Essentially, the team fans out across the globe and explores industries, to collect what they refer to as \u201cproof points\u201d \u2014 from car shows, on the runways, in decorator showcases and so on. At a certain stage they begin to notice meaningful overlap and narrow down the choices. Then one shade achieves critical mass.\u201cWe ask ourselves about the message that color brings, and how we may be trying to use color to shape our experience,\u201d Ms. Eiseman said.This time they started noticing a startling ubiquity of leaf green. There was leaf green on the runway, for example, poking up around the fall 2014 shows and building through spring 2017, when brands like Balenciaga, Gucci, Michael Kors and Prada (to name a few) all featured it to varying extents. Tech companies like using leaf green in their offices. The Cit\u00e9 de la Mode et du Design, which houses the French Institute of Fashion, features a transparent walkway, lit in leaf green, visible from the Seine. Matcha tea is, well, hot.\u201cThere\u2019s a Japanese concept called \u2018forest bathing,\u2019 which says that when you are feeling stressed, one of the best things to do is go walk in the forest,\u201d Ms. Eiseman said. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t do that, what can you do? Bring green into your environment. Put in on your body, or in your house or near your desk. That symbolic message is very important.\u201dIn any case, you get the idea. And if you don\u2019t, the seeds have been planted. It\u2019ll grow on you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Oakland Fire, Brooklyn Artists Vow to Keep Partying", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byJust before midnight on Wednesday, two young women with shaved heads slipped into a hallway during a party at a commercial building in Brooklyn and removed their clothes. While a man wearing a neoprene jumpsuit and knee-high boots crooned in a nearby room, the women crawled under a plastic tarp and began to grapple, a 10-minute piece of performance art that ended with them covered in handprints of black ink as an appreciative audience applauded.It was the first night of a four-day art event called Chasm, which filled an industrial space in the Bushwick neighborhood with LED sculptures, performers and a D.J. who spun not music, but pulsing digital art made in real time and projected on the walls.\u201cArtists need to be in major cities to get any sort of chance of a lifelong career, but most people can\u2019t afford to have up-to-code fancy spaces for their art studios or for their events,\u201d said Julia Sinelnikova, 26, a sculptor and light artist who organized the Chasm spectacle.Echoing many peers in the do-it-yourself scene, Ms. Sinelnikova criticized the authorities for shutting down events if they lack permits or are set in spaces without safety features like sprinklers or escape routes. The result, she said, is that Brooklyn\u2019s artists celebrate even deeper in the shadows. \u201cThey send a huge message to people trying to present culture in a classy way that it should be marginalized, that it should be underground,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are always focused on demonizing people who are presenting this culture in the world.\u2019\u2019City officials maintain that the issue is not the preservation of culture, but the preservation of life by abiding by safety regulations.The authorities have said the deadly fire at the Oakland warehouse, known as the Ghost Ship, trapped partygoers in a jury-rigged warren of art studios and living spaces. The loss has been deeply felt in Brooklyn. But while the deaths have stirred new introspection and prompted vows to be safer, the risky venues will persist, viewed by users as essential to emerging artists as radio was to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.Yet as obituary after obituary has streamed across Facebook feeds in the days since the California tragedy, there is a growing sense of deep agitation. Cities value the creative class, but do little to support it, artists say. And in expensive cities like New York, running legitimate galleries and dance clubs, or bringing existing ones up to code with sprinklers and adequate exits, requires deeper pockets than most artists have.In New York, to throw a legal party in a space like a warehouse, organizers must apply for a permit from the city\u2019s Buildings Department. The agency notifies the Fire Department, which then inspects the site, noting things like well-lighted entryways as well as capacity. Not all pass muster. A party expected to attract 4,500 revelers in the Gowanus Ballroom, a former steel mill built in the 19th century along the Gowanus Canal, was canceled in September after fire inspectors found the building unsafe.But those steps are often bypassed in handshake deals between warehouse owners and party promoters. \u201cWhen you hold an event, in any kind of venue and you\u2019re not adhering to rules and laws that are in place to protect people, you\u2019re doing something very dangerous,\u201d Frank Dwyer, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said. \u201cYou\u2019re putting your customers and first responders in potential danger.\u201d\u201cArt does not trump safety,\u201d he added.The department could not provide a number for how many such spaces had been shuttered, because the city does not differentiate among the kinds of establishments that are shut down for fire code violations, which could include restaurants, bars and commercial spaces.To Brooklyn\u2019s D.I.Y. community, the fallout seems more about scapegoating than safety.\u201cThe upper-crust community is obviously not cracked down on,\u201d a 24-year-old who works in the music industry said. He asked that his name not be used because he runs an unauthorized Bushwick venue in the basement of a three-level home he shares with 12 roommates. \u201cI\u2019d argue that we are fulfilling a more interesting and vital cultural function,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to put us under a magnifying glass definitely inhibits art.\u201dHis home regularly hosts 250 or so people in a basement with no sprinkler system. The next scheduled event is to be a fund-raiser for victims of the Oakland fire this weekend. \u201cThe irony is not lost on me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop us because these people need an outlet.\u201d The basement, he said, is a rare space where otherwise marginalized people can feel free to perform, like a transgender D.J. who recently spun during an electronic music night. Guests have included young people from a nearby housing project.What is needed, many in Brooklyn\u2019s under-the radar art scene say, is support from the city, rather than restrictions. Last week, Oakland\u2019s mayor, Libby Schaaf, announced a $1.7 million fund to bolster and secure the many artist communes that dot industrial Oakland. Such subsidies for artist communities exist throughout Europe.In New York, the party scene is primarily concentrated in Brooklyn, though unsanctioned events also take place in parts of Queens like Ridgewood.\u201cFrom long-established institutions to emerging artists and arts collectives, New York\u2019s cultural community is a tremendous source of energy and vitality \u2014 but safety and creativity are not mutually exclusive,\u201d the spokesman, Ryan Max, said in an email. \u201cWe will not allow code violations that undermine the safety of artists and audiences to go unaddressed.\u201dSome are taking safety into their own hands.Once a month, Silent Barn, an arts collective in Bushwick, undergoes what the artists and the musicians who live and work there call Bummer Patrol. A team of members takes a step back from the freewheeling ethos to inspect studios, lofts and living spaces in the building in an effort to uncover potentially hazardous violations like overloaded sockets, unused space heaters left plugged in or improperly stored art supplies, like paint thinner, which is highly combustible.\u201cWe saw a really important responsibility here,\u201d Eli Dvorkin, one of Silent Barn\u2019s founding members, said. \u201cOn the one hand create a space that is as weird and vibrant and open to experimentation and creative risk, but to do it in the way that was following the rules in such a way as to keep everybody safe.\u201dThat can be expensive. Silent Barn\u2019s current site is a building on Bushwick Avenue; its original homespun venue, started by a group of roommates in their living room, was shut down after accruing a host of violations from several city agencies in 2011. To fund its new, up-to-code home, Silent Barn began a Kickstarter campaign, received grants and solicited supporters \u2014 \u201ca whole bunch of broke people,\u201d Mr. Dvorkin said.In the fall of last year, a fire broke out in the new space. Some residents lost all of their belongings. But everyone escaped unharmed.Advertisement"}

What guides policy-makers to make wise and moral decisions?Many believe that empathy \u2014 the capacity to experience the feelings of others, and particularly others\u2019 suffering \u2014 is essential to all of these roles. I argue that this is a mistake, often a tragic one. When we appreciate that skin color does not determine who we should care about, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014 we are transcending empathy. A good policy maker makes decisions using reason, aspiring toward the sort of fairness and impartiality empathy doesn't provide. Many of life\u2019s deepest pleasures, such as engagement with novels, movies and television, require empathic connection. Empathy has its place. But when it comes to being a good person, there are better alternatives. Paul, you aptly point out the perils of relying on empathy. But you also overstate its problems and undersell its importance.For one thing, you are sparring against a straw version of \u201cempathy.\u201d Encountering an upset friend, one might vicariously share his feelings, understand where those feelings come from and wish for him to feel better. All of these experiences are pieces of empathy, but you have thinned out the definition to only include its emotion-sharing component.

No piece of human psychology is always good or bad, and arguing for or against empathy makes no more sense than arguing for memory or against attention. Instead, we should motivate people to align empathy with their sense of what is right. Moral wisdom requires bringing together the force of emotion and the precision of principle, not splitting them apart. Jamil, I worry about your lumping together some very different psychological processes \u2014 such as feeling, understanding and motivation \u2014 when you talk about \"empathy.\" For one thing, it means we\u2019re talking past each other. To use your analogy, it\u2019s as if I wrote a book \u201cAgainst Haggis\u201d and you responded by citing papers showing how Scottish salmon is good for the heart.Jamil, I worry about your lumping together some very different psychological processes \u2014 such as feeling, understanding and motivation \u2014 when you talk about \"empathy.\" For one thing, it means we\u2019re talking past each other.

{"Headline": "Spread of Fake News Provokes Anxiety in Italy", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Anxiety about bogus news reports is rising in Europe, as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and others express concern that fake news circulated over social media may influence elections on the Continent, including a critical referendum in Italy on Sunday.The outcome of the Italian vote, which could determine the fate of Mr. Renzi\u2019s government, may also affect the stability of European financial markets and further weaken the moorings of the European Union.President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s goal in Europe is to radicalize politics, analysts say, breaking the liberal consensus and strengthening his regional influence.As early as April, Mr. Renzi complained privately to his counterparts about Russia meddling in his country\u2019s politics by supporting anti-establishment parties.Mr. Renzi\u2019s private concerns were relayed by several current and former officials with knowledge of the conversations who were not authorized to speak publicly.His biggest domestic opponent has been the surging and anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which would benefit most should he lose Sunday\u2019s referendum on streamlining Italy\u2019s bureaucracy.Laura Boldrini, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament, said she had no information about whether the Five Star Movement trafficked in fake news or promulgated Russian propaganda. But she did say it was a growing problem in Italy.\u201cFake news is a critical issue and we can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d she said this week. \u201cWe have to act now.\u201dOn Wednesday, Ms. Boldrini met with Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of public policy in Europe, to discuss ways Facebook could limit hate speech and fake news on its pages.\u201cThey can\u2019t pretend that they are just a platform,\u201d Ms. Boldrini said. \u201cThey are giant media companies.\u201dRussia has long had close relations with Italy, especially under Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and media tycoon who was a personal friend of Mr. Putin.These days, Mr. Putin\u2019s government appears much friendlier to anti-establishment opposition figures, like Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, who opposes sanctions on Russia and speaks proudly of his visits to Moscow.Mr. Salvini said he has never received any financial assistance from Russia and called his alignment with Mr. Putin\u2019s party \u201cgeopolitical and free.\u201d Asked if Mr. Putin could be meddling in the referendum, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t even think he knows it\u2019s happening.\u201dWhile Mr. Putin has met with Mr. Renzi, whose office denied expressing worry to world leaders about Russian meddling in Italian politics, the Russian government appears to be especially welcoming to the Five Star Movement.The party, born as an online movement, was co-founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died this year.Today Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s internet and publishing company, Casaleggio Associati, controls several widely viewed websites that often pick up sensational reports found on Sputnik Italia, an Italian version of the Kremlin-created website that projects Mr. Putin\u2019s worldview.One such website, called Tze Tze, which has well over a million Facebook followers, recently ran an article titled, \u201cIs the U.S. trafficking migrants into Italy?\u201dTze Tze makes no mention of its connection to the Five Star Movement, claiming instead to be an independent news outlet. On Friday, a good deal of the site was dedicated to excoriating Mr. Renzi.The constellation of Five Star Movement sites recently lit up with a video that appeared on Russia Today, purporting to show thousands of people protesting against the referendum. In fact, the people had gathered in support of Mr. Renzi and his reform.Mr. Grillo, who has the most widely read blog in Italy, recently posted a picture of a packed Naples piazza and a headline suggesting the crowds had come to protest Mr. Renzi. \u201cA sea of humanity in the square, the people can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dIn fact, it was a picture of a large audience gathered to hear Pope Francis speak.\u201cThe accusations of doing pro-Kremlin propaganda and spreading fake news is ridiculous,\u201d a post on Mr. Grillo\u2019s blog said this week. Supporters of the party believe its opponents have orchestrated an elaborate smear campaign in the news media.Mr. Grillo went on to argue that the websites in question had no official link to his party, as did other leaders in the Five Star Movement, including Luigi Di Maio, a potential rival of Mr. Renzi.In an interview, Mr. Di Maio, the deputy president of the lower house of Parliament, dismissed Italian reports linking his party to anti-Renzi sites. On the question of Russian influence, he said that his party was not \u201cRussian-aligned or American-aligned.\u201dHis spokesman, Augusto Rubei, underlined that there had been only one official institutional visit to Moscow on the part of the Five Star Movement and another by a \u201csimple deputy, who went there personally.\u201dThe deputy in question, Manlio Di Stefano, the head of the party\u2019s foreign affairs committee, attended a conference for Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia United party.He recently posted on the Five Star Movement blog that NATO was secretly preparing a \u201cfinal assault\u201d on Russia.Lia Quartapelle, a member of Parliament in Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party who also sits on the foreign affairs committee, said that its Five Star Movement members \u201care full Russian.\u201dShe said they advocate an exit from NATO and quote Russia\u2019s foreign minister on questions about Syria. \u201cThey use the Russian propaganda,\u201d she said.The Five Star Movement has a history of entertaining conspiracies.In an interview over the summer, Mr. Renzi noted that on the anniversary of American astronauts first landing on the moon, one of the party\u2019s members in Parliament \u201csaid it was a conspiracy by the Americans.\u201d\u201cAnother one of them said she believes the sirens are still in the Mediterranean,\u201d he added.But some of Mr. Renzi\u2019s detractors, even in his own party, argue that he is the delusional one.Massimo D\u2019Alema, a former Communist who was prime minister in the 1990s, scorns Mr. Renzi as a centrist in leftist clothing and is working to defeat him in the referendum. He said he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if Russia had anything to do with the fake news flooding Italy.\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is dark organized center, a group of hackers in the Kremlin trying to affect the Italian referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they could care less.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Wonders How Long Netanyahu Can Back Settlements and Two-State Solution", "Date": "2016-12-25", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 For years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a conservative, has played a double act, competing domestically with his right-wing rivals in backing the settlement project all over the occupied West Bank while professing support for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.Naftali Bennett, the leader of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, with whom Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party compete for votes, is goading him to take on more extreme positions like annexing parts of the West Bank, adding to a sense in Israel that the real Mr. Netanyahu may have to stand up and decide which side he is on.\u201cHe has to choose between the international community and Bennett,\u201d said Shlomo Avineri, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cIt is not an easy choice, but he has to make a choice,\u201d Professor Avineri said, adding: \u201cIs Israel going to alienate itself from the whole world for the sake of settlement activity? And it is the whole world. Is this what Zionism is about?\u201d\u201cFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting.Referring to the American secretary of state, Mr. Netanyahu added, \u201cAs I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d and he said he was looking forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump's administration when it takes office next month.The Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors of countries that had voted in favor of the resolution for personal meetings with ministry officials in Jerusalem, despite the Christmas holiday, which some of those countries celebrate.In a highly unusual move, Mr. Netanyahu, who is also the foreign minister, summoned the American ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a meeting on Sunday night.Mr. Netanyahu also instructed his ministers to reduce their diplomatic activities and contacts with counterparts from the countries that had voted for the resolution for the next three weeks, until the American administration changes, and to minimize travel to those countries, according to Israeli news reports.In an additional step, the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, instructed Israel\u2019s agencies to suspend contact with Palestinian Authority representatives on some unspecified civil matters, though the measure was not supposed to affect security coordination or meetings about water, agriculture and the economy.With the Israeli occupation in its 50th year and the peace process frozen, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and the Palestinians\u2019 veteran negotiator, called on Israel \u201cto seize the opportunity, to wake up, to stop the violence, to stop settlements and to resume negotiations.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu says he is ready for negotiations anytime, but with no preconditions.The Security Council vote seemed to have caught Israel off guard.\u201cI hope for Netanyahu\u2019s sake (and also for ours) that he knows the truth at least deep in his heart \u2014 it was the chronicle of a failure foretold,\u201d Ben Caspit, a political commentator, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Sunday.Mr. Netanyahu and his attorney general had warned that the bill, which recently passed a first reading in Parliament, contravenes international law and could land Israeli officials in the defendant dock of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\u201cAfter he said it, he rushed to vote in favor of the bill. Why?\u201d Mr. Caspit wrote. \u201cBecause of Bennett. The fear of the possibility that he would not be able to siphon seats from Bennett next time on Election Day caused him to act like a small-time grocery owner, instead of a national leader.\u201dEven Haggai Segal, a prominent settler and the editor in chief of a right-wing newspaper, Makor Rishon, wrote in recent months that the Regulation Bill had \u201cno chance\u201d because it would be invalidated by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court and would be used by the International Criminal Court \u201cto incriminate Israel for war crimes.\u201dMr. Segal, who served jail time as a member of the Jewish Underground that maimed and killed Palestinians in the 1980s, wrote this summer, \u201cThe wise thing now is to make do with what it is possible to do, and not lose it all by insisting on impossible goals.\u201dMr. Bennett did not seem deterred. In a statement to reporters on Sunday at the Western Wall in the Old City in East Jerusalem, Mr. Bennett said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to decide between two alternatives: surrendering our land or sovereignty.\u201d He added that steps would be taken in the near future to try to apply Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, the biblical terms for the West Bank.But some Israelis were skeptical that Mr. Netanyahu, in his third consecutive term in office, and fourth over all, would choose one side over the other.\u201cBennett knows that Netanyahu is not going to make a decision,\u201d said Shmuel Sandler, a professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe may say he will go with both. So far, it worked. It is easier for Bennett because he is not the prime minister. Netanyahu wants to enjoy both of the worlds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But can she do so without damaging her own brand?Supported by\u201cShe is really serious about the \u2018care agenda\u2019 and can be a strong inside force,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said in an interview.Perhaps most important, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone else.\u201dA month and a half before Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, 35, are key advisers to the president-elect, with Ms. Trump poised to be perhaps the most influential first daughter since Alice Roosevelt Longworth. They have attended meetings with political advisers, job seekers, foreign leaders and real estate developers who followed up with emails about their eagerness to sell $2 million apartments as \u201cpresident-elect branded.\u201dThey are also triaging calls and emails from their own left-leaning high-powered friends and acquaintances who hope to influence the young consiglieri in chief, believing that if there is a voice for their causes in a Trump administration, it is likely to be that of the first daughter\u2019s.But as Ms. Trump\u2019s platform gets bigger, she is also coming in for scrutiny over perhaps the central question now surrounding her: How will her father\u2019s presidency shape \u2014 for profit or not \u2014 the Ivanka Trump brand she carefully built over the last decade.Some prominent figures remain skeptical of Ms. Trump\u2019s commitment to their causes.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to denigrate the image she projects as a working woman and as a mother and a wife, but there are limits to it,\u201d said Faye Wattleton, the former president of Planned Parenthood. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about self-help when you have access to the best medical care in the world by virtue of your birth. It\u2019s not so easy when you can\u2019t earn a living wage and you have children to support. And we have not heard her speak out on those hard survival issues.\u201dAlso there was the artist Marilyn Minter, expressing puzzlement that Ms. Trump would be associated with an ideology that Ms. Minter says she found personally troubling. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be a feminist,\u201d Ms. Minter said.\u201cI always thought her father was tacky. But she\u2019s elegant and classy and strong,\u201d Ms. Wohl said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t understand this. She is not a hateful, racist person. She\u2019s just not.\u201dTell that to the mogul Barry Diller, a social acquaintance for many years, and one who in 2009 did a business deal with Mr. Kushner.\u201cI think it\u2019s delusional to believe there\u2019s any difference between Mr. Trump and his children on any of his extreme positions,\u201d Mr. Diller, a Clinton donor in the 2016 campaign, wrote in a recent email. \u201cThey\u2019ve had every opportunity to publicly modify them and have not done so.\u201dThere has even been some dissension within family ranks.The supermodel Karlie Kloss has been involved with Mr. Kushner\u2019s younger brother, Joshua, a New York entrepreneur, yet spent the fall making her strong opposition to a Trump presidency known to near-total strangers. Shortly before the election, she posted an Instagram shot of herself filling out an absentee ballot and put the hashtag #Imwithher below it.Joshua Kushner in July and August began \u201cliking\u201d a number of vociferously anti-Trump tweets from his Twitter account.After the election, Ms. Wintour wept as she talked to her staff members about the need to move forward in the face of a stinging defeat. Asked to comment about her relationship with Ms. Trump, Ms. Wintour politely declined through a spokeswoman.For a long time, Ms. Trump\u2019s popularity owed (at least in part) to her ability to smooth out her father\u2019s rough edges.Where Donald Trump was brusque, Ms. Trump was tactful. Where Mr. Trump came off self-centered and easily distracted, she was self-effacing and sharply focused, traits she displayed from her earliest days growing up on the Upper East Side.Ms. Trump worked briefly as a model as a teenager, before entering Georgetown University. Two years later, she transferred to her father\u2019s alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.By then, she was working for her father at the Trump Organization, but she built a social life that in many ways eclipsed her famous father.Mr. Trump and his older sons are not fixtures of the New York power scene, but Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who bought The New York Observer in 2006, are more socially nimble.When Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner broke up during their courtship, a reconciliation took place on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s yacht \u2013 a rapprochement that was brokered by Ms. Trump\u2019s good friend Wendi Murdoch, who at the time was still married to Mr. Murdoch.Occasionally, there were naysayers: gossip items in Gawker and Page Six. But slights about the couple were few.\u201cThey\u2019re ideal politicians,\u201d said Peter Davis, the society journalist Mr. Kushner hired in 2011 at his wife\u2019s suggestion to edit a magazine called Scene. \u201cBecause you come away from any interaction thinking they\u2019re great and nice and don\u2019t have any deeper feeling about them.\u201dAs with many people eager to move up the New York social ladder, the couple engaged in philanthropic endeavors. But they didn\u2019t leave strong footprints. Indeed, to look at Ms. Trump\u2019s charitable deeds is to find echoes of her father\u2019s much-chronicled pattern of claiming a lot while giving just a little.Ms. Trump\u2019s main contribution was to post a promotional link to her fine-jewelry collection, where she sold a Girl Up bracelet, with part of the sales going to the initiative. Peter Yeo, Vice President for Public Policy and Advocacy, United Nations Foundation, says that while Ms. Trump is still associated with the organization, which is non-partisan, she has not been active in it since 2012.Ms. Trump did even less for the \u201cblood diamond\u201d cause.In 2011, she announced she was starting a sustainable bridal jewelry line using ethically sourced Canadian diamonds. In an interview with Women\u2019s Wear Daily, Ms. Trump talked about the \u201cmultitude of ways\u201d she was planning on building her brand into \u201ca truly socially engaged and responsible company.\u201dBut using Canadian diamonds cost more, the line did not get traction, and it was soon abandoned, although Ms. Trump did manage in 2012 to accept a \u201cGood\u201d award from the Diamond Empowerment Fund, a nonprofit co-founded by Russell Simmons.Along with Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump made inroads on the benefit circuit, popping up at galas for New Yorkers for Children and the New York Public Library, where they were guests at other people\u2019s tables. Last year, Ms. Trump attended an amfAR gala, where she was seated with Anthony Weiner and Ms. Wintour. Ms. Trump was also a fixture at the Glamour Women of the Year awards.Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump also hosted a 2013 fund-raiser for Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, at their Park Avenue apartment.Ms. Trump was inclined to leverage her celebrity and give products that bore her name, as she did more than once with her acquaintance Mary Alice Stephenson\u2019s charity Glam4good.\u201cThere were a couple of times I called on Ivanka to send shoes and product, whether it was battling breast cancer or dressing girls from homeless shelters,\u201d Ms. Stephenson said. \u201cThey always sent. I think she\u2019s a lovely person.\u201dDuring the Republican National Convention, at which her father officially accepted the party\u2019s presidential nomination, scrutiny of Ms. Trump began to take a more negative turn.The next week, Ms. Trump got another signal that her father\u2019s race for the presidency was not doing great things for her reputation or her own global brand.It took place in what was supposed to be her safe space: a closed-door gathering of her fellow plutocrats.In Aspen, Colo., at the annual Weekend With Charlie Rose conference in September, Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, her husband, joined the likes of Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Ari Emanuel and Jeffrey Katzenberg at a dinner in the dining room of the Hotel Jerome.But his digs went deeper when Mr. Minhaj, whose parents emigrated from India to the United States shortly before he was born, turned to Ms. Trump.\u201cAt the end of the day, your dad wants to deport my dad,\u201d he said.Ms. Trump sat there, Mr. Minhaj said, \u201clooking uncomfortable.\u201dWhen a now-infamous tape of Mr. Trump and Billy Bush came out a few weeks later, Shannon Coulter started a boycott of Ms. Trump\u2019s brand over social media, with a #GrabYourWallet hashtag that went viral.\u201cPeople think that because she\u2019s polished and well spoken, that she isn\u2019t like him,\u201d Ms. Coulter said. \u201cI think she is more dangerous because she is more polished.\u201dThen came \u201cVicu\u00f1a\u201d at the Kirk Douglas Theater in Culver City, Calif., the latest work from the Tony-nominated playwright Jon Robin Baitz. His satire centered on a Trump-like presidential candidate and his lovely, loyal daughter, Srilanka, who struggles to stand by her monstrous father and power-hungry husband, and ends up a social and professional pariah as a result. (Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory was a plot twist the playwright didn\u2019t see coming.)\u201cEveryone who knows Ivanka says, \u2018How could she support her dad like this?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Davis, the society journalist. \u201cBut she works for her father. The Trump motto is: Win at all costs.\u201dAccording to old friends, Ms. Trump \u2014 who, along with her husband, declined repeated requests for an interview for this article \u2014 is keeping a stiff upper lip.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t complain about anything, and she rarely expresses weakness,\u201d said Maggie Cordish, a friend since college who met her husband, a Baltimore real estate developer, through Ms. Trump. Ms. Cordish says Ms. Trump\u2019s interest in the cause of working women is heartfelt: \u201cShe elevated issues that weren\u2019t part of the Republican agenda because she cares about them.\u201dThe Hollywood mogul David Geffen, a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates, said he has a fondness for Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, even though he did not vote for her father in the election.\u201cI\u2019ve known Ivanka and Jared for years,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a lovely, intelligent woman, and Jared has been a loyal son-in-law. Trump depends on him. He\u2019s a very smart guy. Is he a genius? No, but guess what: The geniuses all lost.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ms. Trump\u2019s reaction to the criticism following her wearing a bracelet from the Ivanka Trump collection on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and her company\u2019s attempt to market it in a press release. It was the company\u2019s president, Abigail Klem, who issued a statement the next day explaining that a \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d marketing employee sent out the release and that the company was \u201cmaking adjustments post-election.\u201d Ms. Trump did not issue an public apology.An earlier version of this article also quoted Beth Nervig, a spokesperson for the UN Foundation, who said that the non-profit had cut ties to Ms. Trump during the election. After the article was published, Peter Yeo, Vice President for Public Policy and Advocacy, United Nations Foundation, contacted the Times to say that their spokesperson was incorrect. Though Ms. Trump has not been active in the organization since 2012, she is still associated with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementDecember 21, 2016Alton L. AbramowitzOrly LobelThe recent report that a growing number of millennials are signing prenuptial agreements to divide their intellectual property in advance is unsurprising. Our most intimate relationships \u2013 marriages \u2013 are, in addition to many other things, high-stake contracts. It would be great if this particular kind of contract could always last forever, sustained by pure love, but that proves not to be the reality for many couples. Prenups are a contingency plan. That millennials are focusing on the future value of their talents \u2014 rather than on current salaries, real-estate and personal property \u2014 makes perfect sense in an age when intellectual property is so highly valued. Employers increasingly require employees to sign away all future ideas and opportunities to compete with the company and divorcing partners too hope to keep these assets in case of a breakup.Still, interpreting prenups for future intangibles is difficult: What did the parties actually mean to include? How are amorphous ideas and innovations to be valued? Usually, prenups provide a level of certainty and predictability, and have the advantage of cutting the fiscal and emotional costs of divorce-related litigation. Absent a finding of fraud, involuntariness or unconscionability, courts generally enforce them. But there is the potential for inequities wrought by this new prenup trend. Women have, historically, been short-changed in divorces. A familiar pattern was that of a wife who supported her husband as he worked his way through law school or medical school by taking low-wage jobs with little opportunity, believing she was helping invest in their collective future. Once the marriage dissolved, though, the husband walked away with the fruits of their human capital.Anecdotally, it seems a similar pattern is emerging within millennial-dominated start-up communities: The wife holds a steady job while the husband works on his app. They share the risk now, but if they divorce, the husband reaps the rewards of his intellectual property, and the prenup ensures his ex-wife gets nothing. Silicon Valley giants have found that millennials don\u2019t want to be salaried employees \u2014 they want to own their company. However, we should not forget that, without a spouse willing to take dead-end low-risk jobs, many new companies never get founded. And if a spouse signs away his or her post-martial rights to a start-up's intellectual property, that altruism could mean a life of unrewarding work and little upward mobility. \nIntellectual property \u2014 including music, art, literary works, films, scientific and medical developments, technology \u2014 is normally protected against third parties by copyrights, trademarks, patents and trade secrets. But among couples, a need has developed to protect \u201cideas\u201d conceived by either a bride or groom who see him or herself as the next Mark Zuckerberg. In the event of a divorce, these couples want protection for what may be each person\u2019s most valuable asset \u2013 the product of their intellect or invention.In the world of divorce law, where I ply my trade, this is not a new concept.  More than a decade ago, I represented a Nobel Prize winner who may have been the most prolific author of writings in his discipline.  His spouse argued that she should share in the value of the copyrights for works he published during their marriage. He argued, however, that those works were an extension of his premarital separate property because a major component of each work was based on thinking and research that he had done well before the marriage \u2014 not to mention, over a lifetime spent in his chosen field of expertise.  In effect, this was his separate property because it was merely an extension of his life\u2019s training and endeavors from the cradle until the moment of their marriage and beyond.The rationale for this argument is that every person is possessed of \u201chuman capital\u201d \u2014 that each person is the product of such variable factors as genetics, intellectual and physical development, experience, innate abilities and talents, along with education, hard work, fortune, happenstance and mentoring.  A well-crafted prenuptial agreement would have provided my client with protection for his writings as they were the products of his mind. They were his intellectual property.   A prenuptial agreement could have carved out the monetary value of his copyrighted materials and protected that value from the claims of his bride. Alas, having trusted her to not claim that which should have been solely his, he proceeded down the aisle without a prenup and spent tens of thousands of dollars on a divorce. It was resolved by a settlement that required him to share a portion of his royalties with her for many years to come.What does this shift mean for marriage and divorce?"}
{"Headline": "After 15 Big Mall Fights, Police See a Culprit: Teenage Boredom", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "Supported byOfficer Tamara Valle of the Fort Worth Police Department received a call on Monday: A fight had broken out in the food court of the nearby Hulen Mall, and 200 teenagers were running, screaming and fighting. Shopkeepers were going into lockdown, slamming their gates shut with customers still inside.As Officer Valle drove to the mall, she received another message: At least four or five similar scenes were unfolding hundreds of miles away, on the East Coast.Officers at several police departments suspect that the episodes were loosely organized on social media, though they cannot prove it yet. In Aurora, Colo., the police heard through an anonymous tip that a Facebook post had told of a fight at the Town Center mall.\u201cWe haven\u2019t actually seen the post,\u201d Sgt. Chris Amsler, a spokesman for the Aurora Police Department, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s true \u2014 whether or not that exists.\u201dOther officers, like Capt. Gary Haba of the Beachwood Police Department in Beachwood, Ohio, believe the more likely common thread is that teenagers have too much time on their hands during the holiday break from school, and just enough freedom to head to the nearest shopping center \u2014 especially if they think they will encounter a lively scene.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s Dr. Evil sitting around in some chair somewhere directing everybody to do this,\u201d Captain Haba said on Tuesday. \u201cIt just seemed like kids showed up and they were waiting to start seeing some mayhem.\u201dAt least one officer used pepper spray to subdue people who were fighting, and one juvenile was arrested, accused of pushing a police officer, Captain Haba said.\u201cEven the officers that were up there sensed that something was different\u201d before a fight broke out, Capt. Christopher Davis, a spokesman for the Manchester police, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey just sensed that something was in the air, per se, that something didn\u2019t seem right.\u201dCaptain Davis said that so many teenagers had arrived to the Shoppes at Buckland Hills that additional city buses had to be called in to take all of them home. Five juveniles and two adults were arrested on charges of fighting or interfering with police officers, he said.The day after Christmas is one of the busiest shopping days of the year, with people returning unwanted presents, using new gift cards and searching for after-holiday sales.This year, mall employees across the country were busy on Monday night posting to Facebook, advising that hours had been changed and that stores had closed. Companies that own or lease several of the malls, including Simon Property Group, CBL & Associates Properties and General Growth Properties, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.A little bit of mischief can escalate into a full-scale police response: In Fort Worth, reports of shots being fired coincided with the mobs and fights, Officer Valle said, leading to responses from the SWAT team and the gang investigation unit. But no one was arrested, and about an hour later, the chaos had subsided.Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Speaks With Taiwan\u2019s Leader, an Affront to China", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with Taiwan\u2019s president on Friday, a striking break with nearly four decades of diplomatic practice that could precipitate a major rift with China even before Mr. Trump takes office.Mr. Trump\u2019s office said he had spoken with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, \u201cwho offered her congratulations.\u201d He is believed to be the first president or president-elect who has spoken to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979, when the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People\u2019s Republic of China.In the statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s office said the two leaders had noted \u201cthe close economic, political, and security ties\u201d between Taiwan and the United States. Mr. Trump, it said, \u201calso congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.\u201dOn Saturday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, in his government\u2019s first official reaction, played down the call.Stressing the good relationship between the United States and China, he said, \u201cI also believe this will not change the One China policy upheld by the American government for many years.\u201dMr. Wang, speaking to reporters in Beijing, characterized the call as initiated by the Taiwanese government. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a petty action by the Taiwan side.\u201dThe White House was not told about Mr. Trump\u2019s call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter.The longer-term fallout from the Trump-Tsai conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a well-established arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing.Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has adamantly opposed the attempts of any country to carry on official relations with it.Initial reaction from China about Friday\u2019s telephone call was surprise verging on disbelief. \u201cThis is a big event, the first challenge the president-elect has made to China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThis must be bad news for the Chinese leadership.\u201dOfficial state-run media have portrayed Mr. Trump in a positive light, casting him as a businessman China could get along with. He was favored among Chinese commentators during the election over Hillary Clinton, who was perceived as being too hard on China.Mr. Trump\u2019s exchange touched \u201cthe most sensitive spot\u201d for China\u2019s foreign policy, Mr. Shi said. The government, he said, would most likely interpret it as encouraging Ms. Tsai, the leader of the party that favors independence from the mainland, to continue to resist pressure from Beijing.Among diplomats in the United States, there was similar shock. \u201cThis is a change of historic proportions,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior director of Asian affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cThe real question is, what are the Chinese going to do?\u201dTies between the United States and Taiwan are currently managed through quasi-official institutions. The American Institute in Taiwan issues visas and provides other basic consular services, and Taiwan has an equivalent institution with offices in several cities in the United States.These arrangements are the outgrowth of the One China policy that has governed relations between the United States and China since President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s historic meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of China, abrogating its ties with Taipei a year later.The call also raised questions of conflicts of interest.Ms. Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Obama took the action on national security grounds, after an intelligence review concluded that the technology could be used for \u201cmilitary applications\u201d and help provide an \u201coverall technical body of knowledge and experience\u201d to the Chinese.The decision is likely to accelerate tension with Beijing, as Chinese authorities make it extraordinarily difficult for American technology companies, including Google and Facebook, to gain access to the Chinese market, and Washington seeks to slow China\u2019s acquisition of critical technology.By happenstance, just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ms. Tsai, Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who designed the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, was in Beijing meeting with Mr. Xi. It was unclear if Mr. Kissinger, 93, was carrying any message from Mr. Trump, with whom he met again recently in his role as the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy sage.\u201cThe presidential election has taken place in the United States and we are now in the key moment. We, on the Chinese side, are watching the situation very closely. Now it is in the transition period,\u201d Mr. Xi told Mr. Kissinger in front of reporters.A small, hard-line faction of Republicans has periodically urged a more confrontational approach to Beijing, and many of President George W. Bush\u2019s advisers were pressing such an approach in the first months of his presidency in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11 defused that move, and Iraq became the No. 1 enemy. After that, Mr. Bush needed China \u2014 for North Korea diplomacy, counterterrorism and as an economic partner \u2014 and any movement toward confrontation was quashed.This week, Mr. Trump appeared to accept an invitation from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit Pakistan, a country that Mr. Obama has steered clear of, largely over tensions between Washington and Islamabad over counterterrorism policy and nuclear proliferation.Reporting was contributed by Jane Perlez from Beijing, Michael Forsythe from Hong Kong, and Eric Lipton and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington.Advertisement"}

How would a repeal of the Affordable Care Act affect the health insurance she and Ms. Zeuner bought on the insurance exchange? Would a more conservative Supreme Court gut the liberal causes she has embraced?Mr. Brown, who works in sales and operations for an oil field services company, was feeling better \u2014 optimistic and increasingly satisfied with the grudging choice he had made to vote for Mr. Trump.

{"Headline": "How Jukin Media Built a Viral-Video Empire", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "FeatureAll the company needed were content-hungry millennials and an algorithm.Supported byOn a Tuesday in April, a team of Jukin researchers gathered in one of several fishbowl conference rooms, away from the pop-music hum of the main floor. Each arrived with a handful of links to YouTube videos he or she had found. A paused clip was projected against the wall as they waited for the procession of pitches to begin. Presiding over the meeting was Dan Trunfio, 54, an experienced TV producer and one of the more senior members of the Jukin staff. On this day he would rule on which of the 64 videos might have the potential to be the next viral hit. A researcher at the head of the table pressed play, and a hatchback subcompact drove into the frame. Its driver swiftly ran the car into a ditch, causing several people in the room to chuckle. Trunfio, looking pleased, assigned the clip a B.Pitch 2 was an anemic office prank: a woman surprised by a screen saver of a camel. Nobody really laughed; Trunfio moved along. In the third video, a drone demonstration terminated in flames, and in the fourth, a man took a tumble from a unicycle while chugging a beer. B and B, Trunfio declared, and the researcher presenting the clips looked relieved. Pitch 5 was a classic soccer ball to the face. Next, a man dressed as a ninja set out to break a board with his forehead \u2014 unsuccessfully. The meeting devolved into laughter on cue, then pivoted quickly back to focus, with an agile restraint known perhaps only to those who laugh for a paycheck.Trunfio moved along: \u201cO.K., good.\u201d There were 58 videos still on the docket.In order to meet this demand for fresh content \u2014 a demand created by the process that supplies it \u2014 Jukin scales idle browsing to industrial proportions. A researcher, on average, watches 200 clips daily. That\u2019s a thousand videos each week, or 50,000 per year, give or take. The company\u2019s research is aided by proprietary software called Riff, which generates feeds based on niche viral keywords. Maybe you\u2019ve seen 15 or 20 good videos of babies tasting lemons for the first time, or troops surprising mothers at Christmas, or dogs and parakeets becoming unlikely friends. A Jukin researcher has seen these, too, plus all the duds that never made it to your feed.Of those 200 reviewed on a typical day, perhaps three or four may be good enough to license, generally for a fee between $50 and $5,000, and often a revenue split. Researchers contact clip owners by any means necessary \u2014 usually through YouTube or Facebook but occasionally over dating sites, or wherever else they can be found. In all, the company has paid out more than $10 million in royalties to video owners.Back in the conference room, Pitch 11 was underway. A woman onscreen was bucked from a horse, and Trunfio, not quite satisfied, assigned the clip a C. I had asked across the table about grading criteria and was told it boiled down to three factors: content, length and \u201cjust how funny it is, more or less.\u201d Though Riff might dig up the clips, only a human can assess their potential for virality. It\u2019s a collaborative process \u2014 algorithm and millennial, hand in hand \u2014 that may offer a preview of what\u2019s to come for the creative class. The work is novel less for its output than for the peculiar skill set demanded to produce it: deftness at trawling the depths of the internet on one hand, and an acute understanding of contemporary tastes on the other. If this work doesn\u2019t sound like real work, that\u2019s only because, in so many ways, it blurs the line between leisure and labor \u2014 whether spatially, with perks like Ping-Pong and kegs, or productively, with tasks that mimic procrastination. Workers like these do for a living what the rest of us do to avoid our work, and they do it so that we might keep avoiding work. Every time you tweet, click a link or share a meme, you play some small part in making jobs like this real.As I pondered the stakes of this new kind of labor, the conference room groaned, interrupting the daydream. A gymnast onscreen had smashed his face on a balance beam. Trunfio allowed himself a smile.This all changed for Skogmo in 2006, when he found YouTube, which was created a year earlier. He was impressed by the trove of family-friendly content, but even more so by the ease with which he could contact creators directly and negotiate the contracts that \u201cCountry Fried\u201d required. Soon he became the online licensing whiz kid. When the Writers Guild of America went on strike in 2007, he says, demand increased for unscripted programs, including clip shows. By 2009, Skogmo had started what would become Jukin from his apartment.Today at Jukin\u2019s headquarters, spread across 18,000 square feet, researchers sit arranged in long rows, plugged into headphones, scrolling through feeds. The factory-farm comparison is hard to resist \u2014 young workers pumped not for their milk but for their discerning taste in content. Before coming to Jukin, the researchers studied English, or media production, or double-majored in playwriting and mass communications. After graduation, they worked in television production, or for start-ups, or as editorial fellows at The Huffington Post. Like other jobs tied to the cycles of social media \u2014 say, tweeting for brands or aggregating tweets for BuzzFeed \u2014 clip research involves skills that are less taught through training than osmosed as a consequence of youth. An eye for picking the next viral hit demands not just fluency in the tastes of the day but also the ability to intuit the ever-evolving zeitgeist as it warps and flows across social media. I asked Nate Granzow, manager of targeted acquisitions, which type of experience best qualifies a researcher.\u201cWe have hired people who\u2019ve done that archival research stuff, and that tends to be something that helps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut generally they just need to be good at\u201d \u2014 he paused for a moment \u2014 \u201cthey have to be sitting on Facebook all the time.\u201dIts most successful clips tend to fall into one of three genres: \u201ccute,\u201d \u201cfail\u201d and \u201cwin.\u201d \u201cCute\u201d is dancing toddlers, puppies and clumsy kittens, anything involving that optimal eye-size-to-head-size ratio. \u201cFail\u201d is whatever tenses the shoulders in empathy \u2014 wipeouts, face plants, schemes gone awry. I\u2019m told the best fails are those that fail in unexpected ways, denying Chekhov\u2019s gun \u2014 e.g., the skateboarder doesn\u2019t eat it on the ramp, but then a guy in the background is kicked in the nuts. \u201cWin\u201d is whatever affirms faith in humanity, so women giving birth in cars and on airplanes, and also people catching marshmallows in their mouths from far away. As Skogmo puts it, viral clips have global appeal because they\u2019re \u201clanguage agnostic\u201d and don\u2019t demand a common tongue. They are a wordless lingua franca built on dirt-bike accidents and things exploding in microwaves.It wasn\u2019t hard for Toomes to track down the creator. Cabot Phillips had already licensed another clip to Jukin, a prank involving a fake proposal gone wrong. This type of repeat business is uncommon to say the least. Virality tends to favor the accidental and organic. A hit is rarely just funny; it must also be funny in a way that\u2019s distinct and surprising. Self-conscious attempts at reverse engineering are almost always an embarrassing flop. Brands try constantly to manufacture virality, but viewers don\u2019t give shares to copycats or fakers. Even the researchers themselves, armed with countless hours of screen time and troves of robust data, doubted their own ability to script a viral hit. What happened to Phillips was lightning-strikes-twice rare.After some negotiation, Toomes offered a cash payout for the rights, plus a 70-30 split of any proceeds in Phillips\u2019s favor. In the end, the video was featured on \u201cEllen,\u201d on which Phillips and his family won a trip to Mexico. The prank appeared on CBS, ABC, USA Today and nearly every major outlet that treats viral content like news. The clip drew thousands of dollars in revenue for Jukin and Phillips and drove more viewers to the upload on YouTube, where more revenue was earned by running ads against the clip. The video, to date, has more than 22 million views. Phillips declined to disclose his exact windfall, but he said it will go toward college for Millicent, his sister and the obliging victim of the zombie attack.What\u2019s novel about businesses like Jukin, those that thrive inside the cycles of social media, is that they\u2019re built atop products created by amateurs. Without a guy to film himself falling down the stairs, it\u2019s very unlikely we would have clip-research jobs, Jukin or even YouTube. But Jukin\u2019s existence performs a strange sort of alchemy, retroactively transforming these pratfalls into some kind of labor. Stranger still is the fact that the process itself \u2014 watching YouTube for hours on end \u2014 hardly looks like labor at all.But this process, multiplied over roughly 150 videos per week, is how Jukin has taken virality \u2014 a formerly random and far-reaching process \u2014 and channeled it into a closed network of its own making. Clips are acquired based on reliable parameters, then pushed out for licensing to websites and broadcasters \u2014 far-reaching vectors that drive a controlled spread. Viral, in the Jukin sense, is less a result of an organic process than a replicable formula, defined only by tropes and a looming expiration date. Toomes said Phillips\u2019s clip was a definite hall-of-famer, putting it alongside Pizza Rat and Peanut Butter Baby.\u201cIt probably lasted around two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is actually quite long compared to viral videos these days.\u201d\u201cEverybody gets excited,\u201d Pagliughi added. \u201cYou see people perk up.\u201dPagliughi, director of special projects, has been with Jukin for about two and a half years. He has a background in television production, which allowed him to enter the company as a manager. But even clip researchers right out of college often level up from scrolling and watching clips to managing their own teams of scrollers and watchers.

The company said Wednesday that it now believes the attacker in that breach, which it says was sponsored by a government, found a way to forge credentials to log into some users\u2019 accounts without a password.Bob Lord, Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, said in a statement that the state-sponsored actor in the 2014 attack had stolen Yahoo\u2019s proprietary source code. Outside forensics experts working with Yahoo believe that the state-sponsored hackers used Yahoo\u2019s code to access user accounts without their passwords by creating forged \u201ccookies,\u201d short bits of text that a website can store on a user\u2019s machine.

Warehouses lie abandoned, their corrugated shells covered in rust. In the distance, an air base, where pilots once took off on reconnaissance missions over mainland China, is devoid of activity, its camouflaged hangars and guard towers symbols of a Cold War long over.Investors are welcome, and on Sept. 8, a Taiwanese-American woman named Chen Siting, or Charlyne Chen, arrived, claiming to represent a very prominent businessman: Donald J. Trump. She had been referred to the Taoyuan mayor by Annette Lu, a former vice president of Taiwan, the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement on its website.\u201cShe had authorization documents issued by the Trump company,\u201d he said, without specifying.On Friday, Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said that there were \u201cno plans for expansion into Taiwan\u201d and that there had been no \u201cauthorized visits\u201d to Taiwan to push for a development project.Asked on Sunday for clarification about the company\u2019s relationship with Ms. Chen and knowledge of her activity in Taiwan, Ms. Miller did not respond to specific questions. She instead repeated in a statement that there had been \u201cno authorized visits to Taiwan on behalf of our brand for the purposes of development, nor are there any active conversations.\u201dAnd even if it emerges that Ms. Chen was largely freelancing, and not acting on behalf of the Trump Organization, the perception of a possible business conflict in Taiwan further complicates the three-way relationship.\u201cEven if the phone call had not happened, once these business dealings came to light, it would send a very confusing signal to Beijing,\u201d said Marc Lanteigne, a senior research fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs who focuses on Chinese security issues.Any business ties could undermine the near certainty that world leaders have had for many decades about some of the basic foundations of United States foreign policy, which has included the primacy of maintaining ties with China in a \u201cvery narrow framework,\u201d said Shelley Rigger, a professor of political science at Davidson College in North Carolina who studies Taiwan-United States relations.\u201cIt is very worrisome not just for leaders in China but for leaders everywhere to think that there could be motivations driving U.S. foreign policy that they can\u2019t, A, know about and, B, work out logically,\u201d Professor Rigger said by telephone. \u201cIf the U.S. government is being influenced by some kind of parallel set of side deals and interests that are not the sort of mainstream U.S. foreign policy and national interest agenda, then no one is going to be able to predict anything.\u201dAdding to the complexity is the fact that the Taoyuan Aerotropolis is a government-run development project, and Ms. Tsai\u2019s administration must give final approval for the complex plan, which involves removing many people from their homes, before construction can begin. Taoyuan is the center of a metropolitan area with over two million residents.Ms. Chen\u2019s visit was followed in October by a work-related visit to Taipei by a Trump Organization employee. The duties of the executive, Anne-Marie Donoghue, include trying to find guests for the company\u2019s hotels worldwide. Ms. Donoghue, who is not part of the company\u2019s development team, did not respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Barrow said he would try to convince Mr. Jammeh to carry out a smooth transfer of power \u201cin the supreme interest of this country.\u201d\u201cI am advising supporters of the coalition to celebrate the victory with discipline and maturity and prepare themselves for inauguration day in January after the end of the term of the outgoing president,\u201d Mr. Barrow said.Criticism of Mr. Jammeh\u2019s announcement has poured in from human rights groups, the African Union and the United States. The government of Senegal, a nation that surrounds Gambia on three sides, called for an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting.Reports that the Senegalese military might intervene circulated in Gambia, but a Senegalese military spokesman, Sgt. Moustapha Diatta, disputed that any plans for intervention were in the works.Isatou Touray, a member of Gambia\u2019s opposition coalition, called on Mr. Jammeh to step down immediately.On Friday, a top military intelligence official close to the president said many high-ranking military and police officers favored handing over power to Mr. Barrow. But, he added, at least some stationed near the president were aligned with Mr. Jammeh.In the hours after results came in last week, Mr. Jammeh was reluctant to accept that he was losing, according to the military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue. Mr. Jammeh had even asked key advisers to annul votes.When he appealed to a gathering of top advisers and officials and asked them to discredit the results, they told him chaos would break out if they did so. A heated argument broke out, but eventually, Mr. Jammeh agreed to concede, according to the official.Advertisement"}

She was 84.Her death, following a stroke, was confirmed by her son, Todd Fisher, according to her agent, Tom Markley of the Metropolitan Talent Agency. Ms. Reynolds was taken to a Los Angeles hospital on Wednesday afternoon.On Tuesday, Ms. Reynolds had expressed gratitude to her daughter\u2019s fans on Facebook.Ms. Reynolds\u2019s career peak may have been her best-actress Academy Award nomination for playing the title role in \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown\u201d (1964), a rags-to-riches western musical based on a true story.Her best-remembered film is probably \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d (1952), the classic MGM musical about 1920s moviemaking, in which she held her own with Gene Kelly and Donald O\u2019Connor, although she was only 19 when the movie was shot and had never danced professionally before. Her fans may cherish her sentimental good-girl portrayals, like the title role in \u201cTammy and the Bachelor\u201d (1957), in which she played a Louisiana moonshiner\u2019s wide-eyed granddaughter who spouted folksy wisdom.Her greatest fame, however, may have come not from any movie role but from the Hollywood scandal involving her husband and a glamorous young widow.When Mr. Todd died in a private-plane crash in 1958, Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Fisher rushed to comfort Ms. Taylor. Mr. Fisher\u2019s comforting, however, turned into a very public extramarital affair. He and Ms. Reynolds were divorced early the next year, and he and Ms. Taylor were married weeks later. That marriage lasted five years. Ms. Taylor left Mr. Fisher for Richard Burton, whom she had met in Rome on the set of \u201cCleopatra\u201d (1963).Almost 40 years later, in an interview with The Chicago Sun-Times, Ms. Reynolds said of Ms. Taylor, \u201cProbably she did me a great favor.\u201d In her 1988 autobiography, \u201cDebbie: My Life,\u201d she described a marriage that was unhappy from the beginning.\u201cHe didn\u2019t think I was funny,\u201d Ms. Reynolds wrote of Mr. Fisher. \u201cI wasn\u2019t good in bed. I didn\u2019t make good gefilte fish or good chopped liver. So what did he have? A cute little girl next door with a little turned-up nose. That was, in fact, all he actually ever said he wanted from me. The children, he said, better have your nose.\u201dMary Frances Reynolds was born on April 1, 1932, in El Paso. Her father, Ray, worked for the railroad and struggled financially during the Depression. Her mother, Maxene, took in laundry to help make ends meet. As members of the Church of the Nazarene, they considered movies sinful.With the promise of a better job, Ray moved to California when Mary Frances was 7, and the family soon followed. Her career dream was to go to college and become a gym teacher, she often said, but when she was named Miss Burbank 1948, everything changed. Two of the judges were movie-studio scouts, and she was soon under contract to Warner Bros., which changed her name.In 1950, she had her first screen credit in \u201cThe Daughter of Rosie O\u2019Grady,\u201d a musical comedy starring June Haver and Gordon MacRae. (Two years earlier she had a small uncredited part in \u201cJune Bride.\u201d) The same year, she played Helen Kane, the 1920s singer known as the boop-boop-a-doop girl, in \u201cThree Little Words\u201d and also appeared in \u201cTwo Weeks With Love,\u201d in which she sang \u201cAba Daba Honeymoon\u201d with Carleton Carpenter. The song became a huge novelty hit.Her roles seemed to mirror 1950s attitudes toward love, marriage and family. In 1955, she played a marriage-minded all-American girl opposite Frank Sinatra in \u201cThe Tender Trap.\u201d In 1956, she starred with her new husband, Mr. Fisher, in \u201cBundle of Joy,\u201d a musical remake of the 1939 comedy \u201cBachelor Mother.\u201dAfter the Taylor-Fisher-Reynolds scandal, Ms. Reynolds rode on a crest of good will and was a popular co-star in a long string of films, mostly lighthearted romantic comedies, including \u201cThe Gazebo\u201d (1959), \u201cSay One for Me\u201d (1959) and \u201cThe Pleasure of His Company\u201d (1961). She also played the title role in \u201cThe Singing Nun\u201d (1966), appeared in \u201cDivorce American Style\u201d (1967) and was part of the all-star ensemble cast of \u201cHow the West Was Won\u201d (1963), a rare drama among her more than three dozen movie credits.\u201cDrama\u2019s unhappy, and playing someone unhappy would make me unhappy,\u201d she told The Boston Globe in 1990. \u201cAin\u2019t for me, honey.\u201dShe took a stab at series television with a sitcom, \u201cThe Debbie Reynolds Show\u201d (1969), in which she played a wacky Lucy Ricardo-like wife who wanted to be a journalist like her husband. It lasted only one season. But she soon achieved a kind of immortality as the voice of Charlotte the selfless spider in the animated film version of E. B. White\u2019s children\u2019s classic \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d (1973).She had married Harry Karl, a wealthy shoe retailer, in 1960, but by the time they divorced in 1973, he had gambled away or otherwise misspent his fortune and hers. Ms. Reynolds set out to re-establish herself financially.She headed to New York that year to make her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1920s musical \u201cIrene,\u201d for which she received a Tony Award nomination for best actress in a musical. In 1976, she had a short-lived one-woman Broadway show, \u201cDebbie.\u201d She made her last Broadway appearance in 1983, taking over the role originated by Lauren Bacall in the musical version of \u201cWoman of the Year.\u201d She later toured the country with stage shows including a new version of \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown.\u201dShe had taken her musical and comedy talents to Las Vegas as early as 1960 and became a fixture there in the \u201970s and \u201980s. She and her third husband, Richard Hamlett, a Virginia real estate developer, established their own hotel, casino and movie-memorabilia museum there. But there were financial problems, and the property had to be sold in the \u201990s.A decade or so later, it looked as if Ms. Reynolds would finally find a permanent home for her Hollywood memorabilia museum, this time in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., the home of Dolly Parton\u2019s theme park, Dollywood. But that, too, fell through, and in 2011, a large portion of her collection was auctioned at the Paley Center in Beverly Hills.Two sales, the first in June and the second in December, took in a little more than $25 million, including $4.6 million for the dress Marilyn Monroe wore in the famous subway-grate scene in \u201cThe Seven Year Itch.\u201dFor a while, Ms. Reynolds seemed to be better known as the mother of Ms. Fisher \u2014 who shot to stardom as Princess Leia in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies and wrote semiautobiographical novels \u2014 than as an actress or singer. Ms. Fisher\u2019s 1987 book, \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d made into a film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine, reflected the sometimes difficult relationship between her and her famous mother.Ms. Reynolds\u2019s career took something of a back seat to her personal life when she married Mr. Hamlett in 1984, but they divorced 12 years later.In 1996, Ms. Reynolds made an attention-getting big-screen comeback when Albert Brooks cast her as his often-clueless yet admirably self-possessed widowed mother in \u201cMother.\u201d Her uncharacteristically low-key comic performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination, though not the Oscar nomination that many had predicted.The next year, she played Kevin Kline\u2019s mother in the sexual-identity film comedy \u201cIn & Out.\u201d And beginning in 1999, she won new fans with a recurring role on the NBC sitcom \u201cWill & Grace\u201d as Bobbi Adler, the Debra Messing character\u2019s gregarious, uninhibited mother, who had a tendency to burst into song (show tunes, of course).She is survived by Mr. Fisher and a granddaughter, Billie Lourd.An obituary in some editions on Thursday about the actress Debbie Reynolds misstated the occupation of Harry Karl, her second husband. He was a shoe retailer, not a shoe manufacturer. The obituary also referred imprecisely to Ms. Reynolds\u2019s role in the 1950 movie \u201cThe Daughter of Rosie O\u2019Grady.\u201d It was her first credited movie role, not her movie debut. (She had a small uncredited part in \u201cJune Bride\u201d in 1948.)An obituary in some editions on Dec. 29 and on Dec. 30 about the actress Debbie Reynolds misidentified her parents\u2019 religion. They were members of the Church of the Nazarene, not Nazarene Baptists. The obituary also referred incorrectly in part to Ms. Reynolds\u2019s stage work after 1983. She did not tour with a production of \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun.\u201dNiraj Chokshi and Richard Severo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Miami Beach Tries to Tame Its Most Raucous Street (but the Fishbowl Drinks Can Stay)", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byMIAMI BEACH, Fla. \u2014 From rooftop bars and rope lines to gridlocked streets and sidewalks, Ocean Drive, the once-idyllic neon heartbeat of South Beach, can trample the senses on most weekends.Tourists sip Technicolor cocktails from fishbowl-size glasses. High-decibel music throbs into the night as people amble along in the glow of stadium-style lights. A weed dealer in the shadows peddles \u201cPurple Haze\u201d for $25 as a near-toothless older man chases women with a seven-foot Burmese python draped around his neck. Police officers are everywhere, scanning the action.\u201cIt has just gotten to the point where the place has become a 24-hour carnival-like crime-ridden circus, where public safety is no longer ensured,\u201d said Mitch Novick, who owns the Sherbrooke Hotel around the corner on Collins Avenue and has been in the area since 1988, when the cafes here could be counted on one hand. \u201cI\u2019m witnessing the blighting of my neighborhood, which was once paradise.\u201dAfter years of complaints from residents and a steady stream of online criticism from tourists, the City of Miami Beach moved recently to try to tame the epicenter of the mayhem on Ocean Drive, the former gleaming gem of the area\u2019s Art Deco 1990s revival. It was the latest test for a city that has long grappled with how to balance the desires of raucous partygoers with the demands of more sedate visiting families and fed-up residents, many of them wealthy.For Ricky Arriola, a Miami Beach commissioner who is spearheading the crackdown on clutter, noise and crime, the bacchanal along Ocean Drive lurched long ago toward becoming Bourbon Street. A modicum of grown-up sobriety was called for, he said.Mr. Arriola, elected commissioner last year, was unsparing in his assessment, saying many cafes are competing in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d and trying to \u201cprey on tourists\u201d with bait-and-switch schemes and other scams. Sidewalks are so cluttered with tables and mammoth umbrellas that \u201cit\u2019s unattractive, unsafe and a breeding ground for crime,\u201d he said. Each business has dueling, high-decibel soundtracks blasting from \u201cspeakers mounted outside, just pumping noise in the street,\u201d he added. And traffic is often at a standstill.The City Commission is gradually tackling these problems, issue by issue. Noise is being curtailed \u2014 now only restaurants and bars, not shops, can blast music outdoors \u2014 and there are plans to beautify the street. Smaller umbrellas that don\u2019t completely block the Art Deco architecture have been rolled out, and fewer tables crowd the sidewalks.Restaurants will face much steeper fines on aggressive solicitation. Cafes bent on scamming are being closely monitored, and city officials hope to institute a cap on the number of downscale chains on the strip.Jessica Robinson, who sat outside Mango\u2019s Tropical Caf\u00e9, where women in feathers performed in a Latin cabaret show atop a small stage, said she lived a few blocks away and usually avoided Ocean Drive. She came on a recent weekend with her Brazilian father, who was in town.\u201cI don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s crowded; it\u2019s overrated,\u201d Ms. Robinson said, gesturing toward the surge of people jostling past a thicket of umbrellas and tables. \u201cMy father just saw someone trying to pickpocket a bag.\u201d\u201cInternational tourists who used to come here in droves avoid this place like the plague,\u201d Mr. Novick said, adding that people who stay in Ocean Drive hotels complain incessantly about noise. \u201cNoise is what fuels all of the riffraff. They need to take the party off the street.\u201dMayor Philip Levine says he has heard it all before. Last year, he tried to move last call to 2 a.m., from 5 a.m., which panicked owners of restaurants and businesses on the strip.A compromise emerged: The city steered more money to the Miami Beach Police Department, which added 12 police officers to the area. The officers sit under towering lights that span the most problematic three blocks of Ocean Drive, from Eighth Street to 11th Street, making them hard to miss. A strategy to help the homeless in the area is also now in place.The police chief, Daniel J. Oates, said that crime in the area had dropped but that a couple of highly visible murders made the problem seem worse than it was.\u201cMany times these days, if someone is committing a street crime, we are catching the person in the act; 50 percent of the robberies, we caught the guy immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s phenomenal, to catch them in the act before they leave the scene.\u201dOcean Drive is usually at one end or the other of a boom-and-bust cycle. For decades up until the late 1980s, it became a favored spot for middle-class retirees and those on fixed incomes; they gossiped as they sat on plastic chairs on the hotels\u2019 front porches and looked at the ocean. Then the hotels fell into disrepair. After the 1980 Mariel boatlift \u2014 an exodus of 125,000 Cubans to Florida \u2014 many of the criminals whom Fidel Castro had released from prison and sent to Miami flocked to the neighborhood, and crime spiked.Carefree from the start, the scene was louche, and its seedy nature was seen as a key ingredient of its cool charm.Beyond the hard-core three-block party scene, some restaurants and hotels, like the Betsy, cater to a more upscale crowd.\u201cPeople are making money, and people are coming here,\u201d said Mike Palma, the executive vice president of Brio Investment Group, which oversees the always crowded Clevelander Hotel. \u201cPeople just experience more negative things on Ocean Drive than in the past.\u201dMr. Novick said he feared the city\u2019s plan of action was a \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d parade of half-measures that would ultimately fail. In his view, the chaos is a byproduct of too much binge drinking in the wee hours, which is why he believes last call should be moved to 2 a.m.\u201cNothing good happens on Miami Beach after 2 a.m.,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent months, it\u2019s been shootings, fights, brutal attacks and armed robberies.\u201dNot everyone is concerned.At the Clevelander, which features Vegas-style dancers on its roof and amped-up music, Tiffany Chalothorn, 26, an actress from New York, sipped tequila with two friends. She had no complaints, she said: The weather was balmy, music by Pitbull was beckoning on the dance floor, and the scene seemed far from threatening.\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d she said. \u201cNew York is so much crazier than this.\u201dAn article on Sunday about efforts to tamp down the raucous party atmosphere on the streets of Miami Beach misstated the surname of the executive vice president of Brio Investment Group, which oversees the Cleveland Hotel.

{"Headline": "Austria Rejects Far-Right Presidential Candidate Norbert Hofer", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byVIENNA \u2014 In rejecting a far-right candidate for president on Sunday, voters in Austria showed the limitations of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s tailwinds on a continent where extremist politics have traditionally brought cataclysm.Call it the other Trump effect, one that may sow caution among some European voters suspicious of the advances of populist politicians.But the choice before Austrians was perhaps the starkest.The bitter yearlong campaign for the presidency pitted Norbert Hofer, a leader of the far-right Freedom Party, founded in the 1950s by former Nazis, against a mild-mannered 72-year-old former Green Party leader, Alexander Van der Bellen.This was a zero-sum political choice, and Mr. Van der Bellen\u2019s decisive victory \u2014 by 6.6 percentage points with 99 percent of votes counted \u2014 left his supporters predictably jubilant, if surprised.In recent days, they had seemed resigned to fearing that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, in particular, was tilting the outcome here against them.\u201cIt is unbelievable,\u201d said Wolfgang Petritsch, a veteran diplomat, a biographer of the former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and the chairman of Austria\u2019s Marshall Plan foundation. \u201cAustria saves the world!\u201d he said with a twist of irony.Austria is too small a sample to know whether the populist tide is abating. Europe still faces pivotal elections next year in France and Germany, as well as the possibility of a snap election in Italy. Those races will define politics in the European Union for the remainder of the decade.But Austria does seem to disprove the idea that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory accelerated a broader public acceptance of populist, anti-establishment forces. In recent days, many in Austria had seemed resigned to the likelihood of a Trump bounce for the far right. Mr. Hofer himself said in an interview last month that the American election had bolstered support for his Freedom Party.Yet it was not the case.\u201cPeople followed Trump with curiosity, shock, fear, jubilation, but I don\u2019t think they drew any conclusions,\u201d Johannes H\u00fcbner, a Freedom Party parliamentary deputy, said on Sunday night. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Hollywood movie.\u201dPerhaps the message Austrians received, he said, was \u201cbeware of another Trump \u2014 don\u2019t vote for Hofer.\u201dMr. Van der Bellen, who exudes a calm in public, campaigned as a sort of anti-Trump, reveling in corny, retail politicking.In an interview in September, he noted that he had been teased for donning traditional Austrian jackets and attending the numerous village fetes and festivals that are the essence of rural life here. Especially, he said, when \u201cit emerges that I like doing this.\u201dHe also suggested then that the intensity of the campaign had led to a broad politicization across Austria, where the voting age is 16. He said Britain\u2019s \u201ctragic\u201d vote to leave the European Union had made people think twice about Austria\u2019s imitating any such move.Mr. Hofer\u2019s party is more skeptical of Europe, but he had stopped well short of calling for Austria to leave the European Union.How leaders of European populist movements have reacted to the election of Donald J. Trump.The country, which straddles the heart of Europe from Italy and Switzerland to Hungary and Slovakia, depends heavily on tourism and exports for its comfortable living standards. A choice to be the first country in postwar Europe to elect a far-right leader for president could have jeopardized that standing.The vote was widely watched across Europe as a measure of how high fringe parties could climb in mainstream politics, turning what is normally a sleepy contest for a largely ceremonial post into a measure of the populist wave that has advanced on both sides of the Atlantic.Anti-migrant and anti-Muslim forces have already ridden a populist path to power in Hungary and Poland and have gained strength in France and even Germany.Mr. Van der Bellen had appealed to Austrians to vote for reason over extremes. Mr. Hofer campaigned on an \u201cAustria First\u201d slogan, and said he wanted to lead a country that was secure \u201cfor our children and grandchildren,\u201d playing on fears of the tide of migrants that have entered Europe.Mr. Hofer\u2019s failure is likely to reverberate around Europe, where the far right has made inroads from Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France to the far-right Alternative for Germany party, both of which have begun eating into support for mainstream conservatives.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Establishment politicians are likely to breathe a sigh of relief and interpret the result as a sign that fringe parties still face what many in Europe have long considered a built-in barrier to broader support because of historical associations with fascism.One person who may thank the Austrians, with whom she has tussled over immigration, is Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Austria\u2019s rejection of the anti-European wave comes as Ms. Merkel heads this week into a congress of her conservative party, at which she will be anointed its candidate for a fourth term in elections next year.Ms. Merkel issued no immediate reaction to the Austrian vote, but her vice chancellor, the Social Democratic leader Sigmar Gabriel, called it \u201ca victory for reason.\u201dAmid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.His party contested the slim defeat, and Austria\u2019s highest court ordered a rerun on procedural grounds. That was then postponed to Sunday, from October, after absentee ballots were found to have faulty glue.Despite the drawn-out process, voter interest and emotions ran high.The presidential contest was the hardest-fought since 1986, when Austrians elected Kurt Waldheim, a former United Nations secretary general, despite revelations that he had concealed his service in Hitler\u2019s armed forces close to the sites of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans during World War II.An array of establishment figures lined up behind Mr. Van der Bellen, but Mr. Hofer garnered some support from mainstream conservatives in the People\u2019s Party, which declined to back the former Green leader.Mr. Petritsch and other political veterans said the length of the campaign worked in Mr. Van der Bellen\u2019s favor. He was the clear favorite of voters in Vienna and other cities, and apparently was able to reach into rural areas where Mr. Hofer won in May but performed less strongly Sunday.\u201cHe built a broad coalition,\u201d said Alexandra F\u00f6derl-Schmid, the editor in chief of the liberal daily Der Standard. Now, she said, Austrians will expect Mr. Van der Bellen to mend the rifts that appeared during the bitter campaign.After early projections showed him clearly lagging, Mr. Hofer, 45, quickly conceded on Facebook, asking \u201call Austrians to stick together and to work together.\u201d\u201cDear friends,\u201d Mr. Hofer wrote, \u201cyou supported me so well and I am infinitely sad that it did not work out.\u201dKimberly Bradley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Jackie-Michelle Martinez, a New Yorker of the Year", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayUpdated, 10:14 a.m.Good morning on this wintry-wet Thursday.Jackie-Michelle Martinez, a Strong-Willed New YorkerWhen Jackie-Michelle Martinez joined the New York Fire Department in 2006, she was one of just 29 women among around 8,000 firefighters and officers.Since then, the number of female firefighters has doubled to 58 \u2014 still a tiny fraction of the department \u2014 but it\u2019s expected to grow, thanks to Ms. Martinez. Last year, she became the department\u2019s first women\u2019s outreach coordinator.Being a firefighter wasn\u2019t always her plan. After college, Ms. Martinez was working as a product manager at a large company. But one day in 2001, a poster in the office caught her eye. Pictured were three female firefighters, with a phone number below.She called, and five years later became a member of Engine 275 in South Jamaica, Queens \u2014 the Merrick Boulevard Magic, as the unit is known.\u201cPeople still to this day have a shock and look of awe about them when they see me get off the fire truck,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing women.\u201dIn her outreach role, Ms. Martinez, has worked tirelessly to make sure that young women across the five boroughs realize that they, too, can be firefighters.In addition to recruiting at women\u2019s institutions and community groups, Ms. Martinez visits schools where girls make up most of the student body. Last week, she spoke at three schools around Queens and Manhattan in one day.\u201cIt was never a career choice for her,\u201d Ms. Martinez said of the recruit. \u201cNow, it is.\u201dBut changing people\u2019s minds does not come without obstacles.\u201cWhen a young man growing up says, \u2018Dad, I want to be a police officer, I want to play football, I want to be a firefighter,\u2019 dad says, \u2018Absolutely, son.\u2019 \u201dBut, she said, \u201cwhen his little girl turns to him and says the same exact careers, dad says, \u2018No, honey,\u2019 because it\u2019s nontraditional.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s fear,\u201d she said, adding that \u201c343 firefighters perished trying to save the city and civilians on Sept. 11, and that weighs heavy on parents.\u201d\u201cIt was powerful, showing that women can still be feminine in a masculine role,\u201d said Ms. Martinez, who graced the cover and was featured as Miss August.\u201cOnce women start to see women wearing bunker gear, the viewpoint will change,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just helping spread the love.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019ll have a tug of war by rain and snow this morning, and high winds this afternoon.Sometimes \u2014 O.K., on rare occasions \u2014 driving in New York City isn\u2019t all that bad.Especially when your car is perfectly in sync with the changing of the traffic lights.He cruised from Harlem down to Washington Square Park, up to 59th Street and down to the Lower East Side \u2014 and he says he didn\u2019t hit a red light for nearly half an hour.One caveat: He started shortly after 3 a.m., so rush hour and jaywalkers were not an issue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Automated Assistants Will Soon Make a Bid for Your Finances", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byMr. Bloch\u2019s company currently creates free automated savings accounts \u2014 and has helped customers put aside over $250 million \u2014 but his vision is to add capabilities until Digit becomes a full-service financial assistant like Jane.\u201cEveryone needs a Jane,\u201d Mr. Bloch said.There is now a lot of competition to create an automated financial assistant for the masses.One feature that both Credit Karma and Mint will offer is more automated tax preparation of the sort that Jane provided for Ender (though with much less robotic charm and thoroughness).The start-ups and the banks are still far from delivering on the promise of a digital assistant that actually takes care of your financial problems for you. Credit Karma and Mint still require you to enter many of your own details. But all the players in the field are working with machine learning and artificial intelligence that will increasingly provide proactive analysis and advice rather than forcing someone to constantly check in.Many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are betting that in the continuing transformation of finance by technology, the financial assistant category will be one of the most lucrative.\u201cThere is lots of opportunity here,\u201d said Charles Birnbaum, an investor at the venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, who recently put money into Albert. \u201cThis is an opportunity that Mint and the banks should have done for people already \u2014 made it really easy to have a good sense for what you should be doing with your money.\u201dThe new personal financial advisers are taking a different tack compared with big-name financial technology start-ups like Lending Club and Square, which provide actual financial services: arranging loans and processing payments. Credit Karma and its competitors are betting that there is more value in being the neutral intermediary that helps customers find financial services and keep track of their various accounts.Advocates of this business model compare the opportunity to the one that Google and Facebook spotted in media, where they serve as so-called platforms for other media companies rather than being media companies themselves. This approach allowed them to become the primary point of contact with the customer, a very profitable and powerful place to sit.\u201cBy being Switzerland, and being neutral, in the same way that Google and Facebook are, we are finding the best products,\u201d said Nikhyl Singhal, a former Google executive who joined Credit Karma as the chief product officer last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the conflict where we are trying to sell our own product.\u201dCredit Karma in particular has been demonstrating how lucrative this can be by charging lenders and credit card companies for every customer it passes along. While the company does not say how much it charges, industry insiders say that Credit Karma generally makes $100 to $700 for every customer who signs up for a credit card, a significant chunk of the revenue that the credit card company will make in the first year. Credit Karma said it pulled in around $350 million of revenue last year.The business model creates the potential for conflicts of interest if an intermediary like Credit Karma sends customers to a credit card company or lender that pays the biggest referral fee rather than the one that offers the best deal for the customer. But the companies are all adamant that they will succeed only if they are known for doing what is best for the customer.Credit Karma now has 60 million account holders, 20 million of whom check in every month \u2014 about 10 times as many as its biggest rival, Mint, and nearly as many as some of the nation\u2019s largest banks.Founded in San Francisco in 2007, Credit Karma has been known for the niche service of providing customers with free access to credit scores, and advice on how to improve them.Recently, though, the company has been using its large pile of cash from venture capitalists to buy and build new features for customers, including one function that searches for unclaimed property for all of its customers and another that can identify and dispute credit report errors through the site.This week, the company is announcing its acquisition of a tax software company, OnePriceTaxes, that has been integrated into Credit Karma to allow free state and federal tax filings for every customer on the site.Ken Lin, the founder and chief executive of the site, said that once Credit Karma had access to a customer\u2019s tax filings it would have a much more detailed picture of that person\u2019s finances and could turn that into new layers of financial advice \u2014 by identifying, for instance, ways to invest money with more tax efficiency.For many, the best-known financial website is still Mint, which gained renown by allowing customers to track all their varied financial accounts in one place. It too makes money by pointing customers to outside financial products that pay Mint for each referral.But Mr. Lin and others in the industry said that Mint, which is now owned by Intuit, struggled to maintain its early growth because it required too much work from its customers, who have to categorize their transactions and do not get much in return.Al Ko, who became Mint\u2019s general manager last year, acknowledges that most Americans are not willing to do the work to keep track of their finances in Mint. As a result, he has led a rebuilding of Mint so that it will do more of the work for customers, and make active recommendations rather than just serve as a place to keep track of a budget.The first big step in Mint\u2019s expansion is the announcement this week of a dashboard that will monitor bills and remind customers when they are coming due, with increasingly urgent notifications as the date nears. Mint is also making it possible for customers to make payments directly through it, rather than a credit card site.Mr. Ko said that 6 percent of Mint customers failed to make even the minimum payment on their credit cards each month, a lapse that can lead to big fees and damaged credit scores.Mint and another Intuit division, TurboTax, are also being integrated so that tax forms from banks and credit cards will be automatically fed into customers\u2019 tax filings.\u201cI envision Mint being as ubiquitous as Facebook,\u201d Mr. Ko said. \u201cThis thing that helps me make better decisions and never forgets.\u201dDigit, the company inspired by Jane, has been rapidly picking up customers, and venture capital money. Now it needs to begin adding features to come closer to the original vision out of science fiction.\u201cEnder was a guy who saved the human race but didn\u2019t have time to do his own taxes,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. \u201cIf you want people to have financial health, you need to do it for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Lies Ahead for Luxury in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayIn 2017 the luxury industry will be faced with a precarious balancing act on multiple fronts. Brands will be forced to find an equilibrium between an exponential growth in technology and their traditional emphasis on the human hand; between understanding their customers\u2019 behavior and surveilling it; between their global presence and their local consumer groups; and between the poles of a customer spectrum that stretches not just around the world, but over decades, from Generation Z to the silver dollar.If they do not, they risk failure \u2014 not because of the macro environment of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, though that cannot be ignored, but because of their own inability to change with an ever more rapidly changing world.Risk is no longer defined as \u201cdoing something new,\u201d but rather \u201cdoing what was done before,\u201d while the greatest opportunity lies in accessing, and embracing, \u201cthe soulful economy.\u201dIt was a constant theme, stretching from the potentially positive effects on manufacturing and the supply chain to the issues of cybersecurity and big data collection, via the complicated question of social media and communications. It\u2019s not just about Facebook anymore, especially when it comes to new and younger consumers who \u201crule the internet\u201d but whose attention span is subject to \u201cconstant churn,\u201d in the words of Ms. Valiando Rojas, and who have a deep-seated antipathy to traditional marketing.Meanwhile, the data collection that has been so lauded in the luxury world, which has been focused on the need to connect intelligence across the retail chain to better serve a constantly traveling customer, contains within it an often unacknowledged threat that could prompt a backlash if not carefully monitored: People want to be recognized, but not known \u2014 which may sound like a specious distinction, but it needs to be parsed on micro level.How to add \u201csoul\u201d to the virtual world \u2014 and what exactly that means (character, ethics, entertainment and experience; not avatars) \u2014 is a conundrum for all luxury brands.It puts new emphasis on identifying and responding to local tastes (to hew only to a single message may seem irrelevant in a walled-up world), and essentially iterating the overall message in a variety of tailor-made ways. Though social media may be connecting the message across borders, it also encourages a multiplicity of voices that should not be ignored. And it acknowledges the need to create internal communities to retain talent.It is this paradox \u2014 that technology, while \u201cimproving connectivity and reducing complexity\u201d as Mr. Kurzweil said, also casts an evermore seductive light on what it lacks: the human element \u2014 and how it is resolved that will define the future of an industry based on the work of the hand. \u201cCorporate\u201d and \u201ccreative\u201d are no longer enough.

{"Headline": "After Burst Radiator Kills 2 Girls, Investigators Scrutinize Bronx Building", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byThe two girls, Ibanez Ambrose, 2, and Scylee Vayoh Ambrose, 1, died Wednesday from what the medical examiner\u2019s office said was hyperthermia and thermal injuries, or overheating and burns, after a radiator malfunctioned and their bedroom filled with scalding steam.In visits to the apartment on Monday and on Nov. 2, inspectors from the Department of Homeless Services checked the radiators and found no problems, according to a department spokesman, David Neustadt.Police officers were reviewing surveillance video from the building and they sent the radiator and the valve to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for analysis, said Stephen P. Davis, the Police Department\u2019s top spokesman.Patrice M. O\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office, said that prosecutors were investigating conditions in the building and the landlord, Moshe Piller, in connection with the deaths of the children. Asked if the parents were also subjects of the investigation into the deaths, Ms. O\u2019Shaughnessy declined to comment.The girl\u2019s father, Peter Ambrose, said that a valve on the radiator came off, causing steam to be released into the girl\u2019s bedroom.He said in an interview that his wife left the apartment Wednesday morning while he stayed home and slept, unaware of what was going on in the adjacent room. His wife returned \u2014 around 11:45 a.m., according to the police \u2014 went into the girls\u2019 room and found them inside.At 12:08 p.m. a neighbor called 911, the police said; the girls were taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center and pronounced dead there at 12:22 p.m.It was not clear why the parents did not check on the toddlers earlier, or why Mr. Ambrose did not hear the steam or any noise made by the girls as their bedroom became dangerously hot.But Mr. Davis said police investigators were satisfied with Mr. Ambrose\u2019s account that he had not left the apartment. \u201cWe\u2019re working together with the Buildings Department and we\u2019re assisting them,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cBut right now at this point absent any indication of criminality, it doesn\u2019t really amount to a primary police investigation.\u201dThe family first came into contact with the Department of Homeless Services in July 2015, and was placed in the apartment on Hunts Point Avenue, near Spofford Avenue, on Nov. 1 that year, a city official said.The girls lived most of their lives in homeless shelters.On her Facebook page, the girls\u2019 mother, Danielle Ambrose, wrote posts about Ibanez\u2019s birth on Nov. 5, 2014, and about Scylee\u2019s on Oct. 17, 2015 \u2014 about two weeks before the family moved into the Bronx apartment.The family had at least two encounters with child welfare officials in recent months.Employees of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services questioned the couple in November because of a report that Ms. Ambrose had been panhandling with the two girls at Grand Central Terminal, a police official said. Investigators also visited the family\u2019s apartment in August after the couple got into a loud argument, the official said.The apartment was one of five in the building rented by a private social services provider, Bushwick Economic Development Corporation, contracted by the city to house homeless families. Such apartments are known as cluster sites and have been used by the city because dedicated homeless shelters are full, with the number of homeless people in the city at a record high.But officials say that it is harder to organize services for families in such apartments, partly because they are decentralized.Stephen Levin, a Brooklyn city councilman who is chairman of the General Welfare Committee, which oversees the Department of Homeless Services and the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, said there have long been questions about coordination between different city agencies that may come into contact with cluster site families.He said that at a committee hearing in October, city officials said they were working to reach an agreement to improve coordination between the agencies.\u201cThat\u2019s a longstanding concern,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThis is an unimaginable tragedy and it\u2019s just utterly heartbreaking.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The online archive, which intends to feature an image or two from each photographer, includes a questionnaire alongside each photograph.At present, the site features images by a few regular contributors, alongside Mr. Haviv and Ashley Gilbertson, his colleague at VII who submitted film that contained a photo of his young son thrusting an ice cream cone skyward, like the Statue of Liberty.

{"Headline": "As Fake News Spreads Lies, More Readers Shrug at the Truth", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byHAM LAKE, Minn. \u2014 One morning last week, Larry Laughlin, a retired business owner, opened his shiny black Dell laptop and scrolled through Facebook.Most of the posts were ordinary news stories from conservative sites: Donald J. Trump\u2019s deal with the Carrier company. The political tussle over the recount. But a few items were his guilty pleasures.\u201cI like this guy,\u201d said Mr. Laughlin, looking at a post by the conservative commentator and author Mark Dice.Mr. Dice has promoted conspiracy theories that the Jade Helm military training exercise last year was preparation for martial law and that the Sept. 11 attacks were an \u201cinside job.\u201d But Mr. Laughlin likes him for what he said was his humorous political commentary and his sarcastic man-on-the-street interviews.\u201cI just like the satisfaction,\u201d said Mr. Laughlin, who started his own business and lives in an affluent Twin Cities suburb. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hockey game. Everyone\u2019s got their goons. Their goons are pushing our guys around, and it\u2019s great to see our goons push back.\u201dThe larger problem, experts say, is less extreme but more insidious. Fake news, and the proliferation of raw opinion that passes for news, is creating confusion, punching holes in what is true, causing a kind of fun-house effect that leaves the reader doubting everything, including real news.That has pushed up the political temperature and increased polarization. No longer burdened with wrestling with the possibility that they might be wrong, people on the right and the left have become more entrenched in their positions, experts say. In interviews, people said they felt more empowered, more attached to their own side and less inclined to listen to the other. Polarization is fun, like cheering a goal for the home team.\u201cThere are an alarming number of people who tend to be credulous and form beliefs based on the latest thing they\u2019ve read, but that\u2019s not the wider problem,\u201d said Michael Lynch, a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut. \u201cThe wider problem is fake news has the effect of getting people not to believe real things.\u201dHe described the thinking like this: \u201cThere\u2019s no way for me to know what is objectively true, so we\u2019ll stick to our guns and our own evidence. We\u2019ll ignore the facts because nobody knows what\u2019s really true anyway.\u201dNews that is fake or only marginally real has lurked online \u2014 and in supermarket tabloids \u2014 for years, but never before has it played such a prominent role in an American election and its aftermath. Narrowly defined, \u201cfake news\u201d means a made-up story with an intention to deceive, often geared toward getting clicks. But the issue has become a political battering ram, with the left accusing the right of trafficking in disinformation, and the right accusing the left of tarring conservatives as a way to try to censor websites. In the process, the definition of fake news has blurred.\u201cFake news is subjective,\u201d Mr. Laughlin said. \u201cIt depends on who\u2019s defining it. One man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u201dFor Mr. Laughlin, conservative sites are a balm for the soul in a liberal world whose narrative of America, he says, seems to diminish him and all that he has accomplished. He was his own legal guardian at 16, after his mother fled his alcoholic father. He built his metal finishing business from scratch after earning an associate degree from a community college. The company he owned employs about 17 people. He and his wife adopted three mixed-race children.\u201cMy struggles in life are just dismissed,\u201d he said, recalling being lectured by one of his children\u2019s liberal friends at a party in his large home. \u201c\u2018You have a nice house and got it made because you are a white guy.\u2019 There are all of these preconceived notions that I\u2019m a racist, idiot, a bigot, and oh, uneducated.\u201dHe feels alienated from the conventional news media for some of the same reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s like an inside joke for people on the left, and we are the butt of the joke,\u201d he said of one left-leaning website. \u201cAt some point, we stopped listening.\u201dMr. Laughlin likes news that strikes back against that. These days, he takes the most pleasure in watching clips strung together by conservative websites of liberal commentators sneering about how ridiculous Donald J. Trump was as a candidate and how he had no chance at becoming president.\u201cThis is like our sweet release after the election,\u201d Mr. Laughlin said. He said the hyperpartisan environment left him craving intense content. \u201cI\u2019m picking through the fruit and looking for the reddest apple,\u201d he said.But Mr. Laughlin avoids news that looks false, like a story after the election that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, and said he was careful not to click on such items to deny them advertising revenue. He said he cringed when he heard about the incident in the pizza restaurant. \u201cIt adds to the stereotype that we\u2019re all nutters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all get lumped together with this guy.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden they got this big push of registered voters,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said, referring to California. \u201cThey were all illegals. The same thing in the state of Washington, Los Angeles and Houston, too.\u201dHe said that Mr. Jones, who has called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, \u201ccan get a little conspiratorial,\u201d but added that he \u201craises some very logical and important questions.\u201dMr. Montgomery has concerns about immigration. He lived for years in South Florida, where he had a painting business that was deeply affected by cheap labor from Hispanic immigrants.\u201cThey can\u2019t say that these people are not taking jobs away from American citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come up and they lowball. It hurts a lot of people.\u201dMr. Montgomery pushed back: \u201cCheck it out, it\u2019s true!\u201dMr. Montgomery said he was nostalgic for the news of old, when Walter Cronkite delivered it. But the reputation of the press has been tarnished, he said, and people are left to navigate the fractured landscape on their own.The online content can be frustrating, with headlines that promise more than the story delivers.He noted one with a headline along the lines of \u201cThe wait is over; Hillary\u2019s being indicted.\u201d\u201cBut then you click and there\u2019s nothing in there about her being indicted,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like looking at a menu in a restaurant. Oh, that sounds delicious, it sounds great, and then it\u2019s this teeny weeny thing you maybe get three bites of.\u201dThat type of insult increases the partisan divide. Paul Indre, a project manager for a hardware goods company in Akron, Ohio, who gets his news from podcasts and television, avoids much of online news. But he understands why people go there in a polarized era.Mr. Indre, a moderate Republican, said he remained vigilant against fake news.\u201cIf I\u2019m in a Trump group and someone will share something that\u2019s fake news,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask them \u2018Hey did you check that?\u2019\u201dBut it is often impossible to tell whether \u201cthey are just lobbing a bomb, or do they really believe it?\u201d he said. \u201cYou have some folks who are a little na\u00efve, who don\u2019t follow the news and believe it. I mean, people do buy The National Enquirer and believe it.\u201d\u201cBut some of it might be revenge factor, getting back at something they are hearing from the left,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they are just reacting to something. Maybe we are just in this reactionary period.\u201dTalya Minsberg contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Struggles to Put Out Online Fires in Israeli-Palestinian Conflict", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe have similar conversations around the world about the problem of online hate speech,\u201d said Simon Milner, Facebook\u2019s policy director for Britain, the Middle East and Africa. \u201cBut we do absolutely see in Israel and the Palestinian territory that this is one of the central issues in society even more in this region than elsewhere.\u201dFor Facebook, the dominant social media platform in this region, the issue has taken on more urgency in the 14 months since the beginning of a wave of stabbings and vehicular assaults by Palestinians against Israelis. A company proficient at technology finds itself whipsawed by forces of history that have defied political, diplomatic and religious leaders since long before Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, was born.No matter what it does, Facebook invariably seems to offend one side or the other. Israel complains about incitement? Facebook takes down posts. Palestinian journalists complain about being muzzled? Facebook lifts the suspension of their accounts.\u201cWe realize we\u2019ve got a lot to learn,\u201d Mr. Milner said, \u201cand we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last few years.\u201dIt is not hard to find provocative posts that straddle or even cross the line into advocacy of violence.One post shortly after the latest violence began showed an injured Israeli soldier and a militant holding a knife that displayed an Arabic message: \u201cAll means are permissible in jihad as long as they bring victory for religion. Sword; or explosion; or bullet; and for them to challenge the knife.\u201d\u201cStab \u2014 there is no place in your land for an outsider\u201d\u201cStab \u2014 and be strong and not submissive\u201d\u201cStab \u2014 and lift your head like a palm tree\u201d\u201cStab \u2014 in Jerusalem and in Hebron\u201dStill another showed a video of a bearded man looking mournfully at a picture of another man, presumably killed in the struggle against Israel, as a song plays: \u201cMy blood boils in anger and melds with your blood.\u201d Then, in a dramatization, the man builds a bomb, puts it in a bag, records himself making a statement on video, boards a bus and blows it up along with its passengers.Ms. Darshan-Leitner filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Facebook in federal court in New York this fall, claiming that it provides material aid to Hamas. The suit combined a previous claim on behalf of 20,000 Israelis blaming incitement on Facebook for the recent violence with another claim by relatives of several Americans killed in terrorist attacks in Israel.Facebook says it bars Hamas and other designated terrorist groups. Last month, it asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing a 1996 federal law insulating internet companies from liability for speech by users of their services. Moreover, it argued that Ms. Darshan-Leitner could not show that the offending posts had directly caused specific acts of violence.\u201cFacebook has zero tolerance for terrorism,\u201d the company said in a brief. \u201cIt condemns terrorist actions, prohibits terrorist content on Facebook and swiftly removes any reported terrorist content.\u201d\u201cI personally really believe in freedom of speech,\u201d Ms. Shaked said in an interview. \u201cBut when you\u2019re calling to kill someone or when you\u2019re calling for terrorist attacks, it\u2019s violence. I\u2019m not going to try to remove the words \u2018Free Palestine.\u2019 But if they\u2019re showing how to stab Jews, that should be removed.\u201dWithin weeks of meeting with Israeli officials, Facebook suspended the accounts of seven journalists from two Palestinian news agencies said to have extremist ties. The journalists said they had been suppressed for criticizing Israel, which occupies the West Bank, builds settlements on land Palestinians consider theirs and demolishes homes of those tied to terrorists.Palestinian journalists started an online protest with the hashtag #FBcensorsPalestine. The company reversed course and restored the journalists\u2019 accounts.\u201cSurprisingly, we heard back immediately from Facebook officials, who apologized for our accounts being put on hold and said that it was a technical error on their end,\u201d said Hussam al-Zaygh, the managing editor of the Shehab News Agency. \u201cThe hold on our pages was removed and we haven\u2019t experienced any negative reactions from Facebook since this last incident.\u201dMr. Milner, the Facebook policy director, conceded error: \u201cSometimes we make mistakes, and it\u2019s unfortunate that in recent weeks that did involve some accounts of Palestinian journalists. We apologized to the individuals involved.\u201dAnother Facebook official traveled to the West Bank last week to assure Palestinian journalists of the company\u2019s commitment to free expression.\u201cWe are saying we want free space to talk about our issues here in Palestine and we should have freedom like all over the world,\u201d said Iyad al-Refaie, the editorial manager of Al Quds News Network. \u201cEvery user of Facebook around the world, he has freedom about what he publishes or not.\u201dIsrael does not rely solely on Facebook to crack down on incitement. The authorities have increasingly arrested users who post inflammatory items, and Arab news outlets estimate that hundreds have been charged.Mr. Abudaabes said in an interview that he was surprised to become one of them. The owner of a small photography school and marketing business in Rahat, a largely Bedouin city in the Negev Desert, he said he had used Facebook for nine years without trouble.\u201cWhen I posted that, it was totally against people who celebrate fires, who think that these fires are better for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I post something like that, I didn\u2019t think for a minute that it will get me problems with the Israeli government.\u201dBut within an hour, he said, the police arrived at his home. \u201cMy comment was: \u2018You know, it\u2019s funny you don\u2019t understand my post. It\u2019s the opposite,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to understand.\u201dHe was released on nearly $4,000 bail. The authorities kept his cellphone and laptop, and ordered him to remain home for five days and stay off Facebook for 15 days.Prosecutors announced Sunday that they would not file charges \u201cbecause of lack of guilt.\u201d For Mr. Abudaabes, posting on Facebook came close to playing with fire.Reporting was contributed by Rami Nazzal in Ramallah, West Bank, and Myra Noveck, Irit Pazner Garshowitz and Diaa Hadid in Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "She Brings Comic Book Characters to Life", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byComic book enthusiasts have been transforming themselves into their favorite characters for decades using mass-produced costumes or custom outfits. This dress-up, known as \u201ccosplay,\u201d has become a celebrated part of fandom. But Kay Pike, 28, is a comic book fan with a different approach: Call it cospaint.Ms. Pike painstakingly turns herself into an array of characters with a paintbrush, bold colors and a steady hand. Thanks to a keen eye for lighting and shading, her metamorphosis into heroes and villains \u2014 male and female, human and alien \u2014 eerily resembles two-dimensional comic book art.Ms. Pike, who lives in Calgary, Alberta, said her fascination with comic book characters began early. \u201cI was more than a little obsessed with anime as a kid,\u201d she said, referring to the Japanese cartoon genre. That led to anime conventions and cosplay. \u201cI was kind of nerdy,\u201d she said. \u201cI really liked the characters, and I wanted to connect with other people who loved all the things I did.\u201dIn 2014, Ms. Pike began struggling with arthritis. It prevented her from sitting at a sewing machine for long periods, which limited her cosplay. Though she has chronic pain, her attitude remains positive: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have it, I wouldn\u2019t have discovered this ability.\u201dHer new passion started in earnest last December, when she transformed herself into a character from Attack on Titan, a manga series about fearsome giants that prey on humans. Ms. Pike became Colossus Titan (picture a body without skin, something a medical student might use for anatomy lessons). The character\u2019s face and shoulders required about four hours of painting.\u201cYou\u2019re painting yourself to be the comic, rather than the character,\u201d Ms. Pike said.But perhaps the most important metric for her is that her Twitch following (46,000) includes 600 paid subscribers, who get access to ad-free streams, birthday treats and other goodies for $4.99 per month.Ms. Pike works with her husband, Moose, 37 (a photographer), on the live streams out of their home studio. He has the added roles of producer and stage manager, reading his wife audience questions and keeping up engagement. \u201cIt can be pretty chaotic,\u201d Ms. Pike said. \u201cWe try to keep it a 100 percent interactive experience with 200 to 600 people.\u201dShe enjoys the feedback, whether it is suggestions for new characters to paint, questions about particular techniques or viewers asking how they can pursue their own projects. \u201cIt gets back to the root of why I enjoyed cosplay \u2014 to connect with all the other nerdy people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my small power as an artist: to help other people find their own motivation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Street Theater to Wagner on the Opera Stage", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byOn a recent morning, the stage director \u00c0lex Oll\u00e9 was supervising a chorus rehearsal for Richard Wagner\u2019s \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d in an upstairs room of the opera house here.As the chorus moved forward, some of its members held wine bottles to mimic a scene of drunken singing. Mr. Oll\u00e9 stepped in, grabbed a bottle out of a singer\u2019s hand and swung it above his head. \u201cWhen you come out running, it needs to be more natural,\u201d he said.Mr. Oll\u00e9, whose production of \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d opens at the Teatro Real on Saturday, has sought to bring to opera the acting style that he developed in street theater as part of a Catalan company, La Fura dels Baus, that spearheaded the avant-garde arts movement that surfaced in Spain in the late 1970s, after the end of Francisco Franco\u2019s dictatorship.For the past two decades, Mr. Oll\u00e9, 56, has devoted almost all of his time to opera. But he remains somewhat of an unusual presence amid the music scholars of the opera world, with an unconventional approach to staging productions.Pablo Heras-Casado, who is conducting the Madrid production of \u201cThe Flying Dutchman,\u201d said that Mr. Oll\u00e9 brought \u201cthe dimension of the showman, someone who is most interested in the global effect\u201d rather than some of the intricacies of the opera.Mr. Oll\u00e9 is a self-taught director who says his knowledge of Wagner comes from browsing the internet, rather than from reading the composer\u2019s own writings and musical scores.\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to submerge myself in the world of Wagner,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a creator, it\u2019s good to have a fresh and intuitive vision, like a child who brings spontaneity,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that at times it isn\u2019t necessary to have all the information \u2014 it can contaminate you.\u201dMr. Heras-Casado said that in some ways, Mr. Oll\u00e9\u2019s \u201clack of prejudices\u201d about Wagner\u2019s work made his own task easier. Mr. Oll\u00e9 \u201cjust trusts that the musical director will be on his side,\u201d he said.The director has transposed Wagner\u2019s tale of a sea captain who comes across a ghost vessel from its original Norwegian setting to Chittagong, the port city in Bangladesh, which has itself been converted into a giant scrapyard for the world\u2019s unwanted boats.Mr. Oll\u00e9 said he discovered Chittagong, which he called \u201chell on earth,\u201d in a documentary that he watched shortly before he was asked to stage \u201cThe Flying Dutchman,\u201d which had its debut in Lyon in 2014. (The Madrid production will be broadcast live on Facebook on Dec. 23.)Mr. Oll\u00e9 first stepped into an opera house when he was 18 \u2014 not as a spectator, but as an extra in a Barcelona production of \u201cThe Soldier\u2019s Tale,\u201d by Igor Stravinsky. It was not until his 30s that he sat down to watch an opera, when he was already a star of the theater world with La Fura dels Baus. Between 1978 and 1981, Mr. Oll\u00e9 took courses, mostly to become a puppeteer at a theater institute in Barcelona. He eventually performed on a TV comedy show, with a puppet that he recalls was \u201csome kind of worm.\u201dHe then joined with other street performers, traveling around the region from one village feast to the next. Their Fura company was limited to nine members because \u201cthat was what we had room for\u201d in their Mercedes minivan, Mr. Oll\u00e9 recounted. In 1983, the company took part in a theater festival in the coastal town of Sitges, presenting their show in an underground passage below the railway line. Such unorthodox venues \u2014 including slaughterhouses, prisons, a funeral parlor and construction sites \u2014 became the Fura\u2019s trademark. Their shows also combined music and wild movements with shouts, but almost no dialogue.\u201cWe were more like a rock band than a theater company,\u201d Mr. Oll\u00e9 said in an interview at the opera house in Madrid, while showing old photos of his Fura days on his laptop. In some of them, he is covered in mud and smashing a car with a sledgehammer.\u201cA lot of people thought it was all improvised, out of control and chaotic, but everything was absolutely measured,\u201d Mr. Oll\u00e9 said. \u201cWe created this sense of panic to break down the emotional armor of the public.\u201dIn 1992, Mr. Oll\u00e9 and Carlus Padrissa, a fellow Fura director, were chosen to stage the opening ceremony for the Barcelona Olympic Games. Mr. Oll\u00e9 said they were aiming to depart from what he called the \u201cWalt Disney version\u201d of previous ceremonies, representing instead important issues of that time, including the war in Yugoslavia and the AIDS epidemic.Mr. Oll\u00e9 and Mr. Padrissa then started venturing together into other forms of art. Their international opera breakthrough came in 1999 when the director of the Salzburg Festival at the time, Gerard Mortier, asked them to stage \u201cThe Damnation of Faust\u201d there. The two Fura directors eventually parted ways, with Mr. Padrissa pursuing a successful opera career of his own. Mr. Oll\u00e9, who is based in Barcelona, has a full schedule staging operas that has taken him from Covent Garden in London to Sydney. The switch to opera, he said, meant working with bigger budgets, including for video projections, while still using a wide range of artistic talent. \u201cWe have singers, actors, dancers and an infrastructure that you sadly don\u2019t now get in theater,\u201d he said.Albert Boadella, a leading Spanish playwright and theater director, said he found Mr. Oll\u00e9 to be at his best adapting works like those of Wagner, rather than operas with a more \u201cintimate\u201d libretto. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another director who has managed to transpose better the Wagnerian spirit to our times,\u201d Mr. Boadella said. \u201cWagner is a grand spectacle, almost cinematographic music, and that is a language that suits \u00c0lex perfectly.\u201dOne of Mr. Oll\u00e9\u2019s most ambitious projects is a new opera, \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d by the American composer Mark Grey, which is scheduled to have its world premiere at La Monnaie in Brussels in 2019 and then move to Cincinnati.Mr. Oll\u00e9 sees himself as capable of taking on the uphill challenge of bringing opera to younger people. \u201cEvery time you pass the entrance of an opera house and see the women with fur coats and the men in black tie, that makes a younger public take a step back,\u201d Mr. Oll\u00e9 said.While he cannot change the dress code, he said he could at least ensure that, once inside, younger members of the audience would be drawn in by video and modern settings.Mr. Oll\u00e9 said he also found something surprising inside Wagner\u2019s work, namely the composer\u2019s concept of \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d or \u201cGesamtkunstwerk,\u201d to reunite drama and opera. \u201cWith the Fura, we also talked about the \u2018total show,\u2019 but we had no idea about Wagner then,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Becoming a Pack Leader of Dogs and Donkeys", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byRunning With ShermanIn the weeks after Sherman joined our family, we were doing our best to heal his body, but his mind needed care as well.Sherman was the rescue donkey we\u2019d adopted, with horribly overgrown hooves and fur stiff with caked manure after being kept for years in a small stall.Neglected animals are prone to despair, and people who know donkeys told us the only thing likely to lift Sherman\u2019s drooping head and really bring him back to life was a job. We found one \u2014- a long shot almost too crazy to take seriously. What if we trained him for the World Championship Pack Burro Race in Fairplay, Colo.?It\u2019s tough nursing a sick donkey into shape, but persuading it that really wants to run side-by-side with you for marathon distances is a challenge of an entirely higher magnitude. The trick, I was told, is to make him think it\u2019s his idea. How you pull that off, however, I had no clue.Then one afternoon I got a call from Luis Escobar, who was facing a similar problem, but with shelter dogs. Luis is a highly accomplished ultrarunner in his own right, with victories in several 100-mile races to his credit. I first met him 10 years ago, when he was a member of the \u201cDream Team\u201d that journeyed into the Copper Canyon in Mexico for the adventure I wrote about in \u201cBorn to Run.\u201dEven for the Sheriff, motivating teens to tackle hill repeats under the August sun isn\u2019t easy, so instead of practice one morning, Luis took the team to a Santa Barbara animal shelter to run with the dogs. Only later did he realize that might have been a big mistake.\u201cHe was just this little dog shivering in a metal cage and a few days later he\u2019s like an international cult figure,\u201d Luis would say. Josh took his mother to the shelter, and Fred has been a member of the Menusa family ever since. Luis heard from dozens of coaches who wanted to follow his lead, and Rachael Ray even flew him to New York to appear on her show.Then came the backlash.This is a blood bath waiting to happen, Facebook commenters warned. These animals are traumatized and unpredictable. What if one of them erupts? Or a kid trips and triggers a pile-on? In a flash, kids and dogs alike can be in serious trouble. Luis could have brushed aside these cranks, since thousands of other people and a celebrity chef were calling him a hero, except in the pit of his stomach, he suspected the cranks were right. \u201cI\u2019ve got 15 crazy kids and 14 crazy dogs,\u201d he thought. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of crazy.\u201dWhen I heard what Luis was up against, I realized that in some ways we were in the same boat: We both had to figure out a way to make damaged animals our willing partners. In Luis\u2019s case, the risks were even greater: He was working with abandoned pit bulls.Someone else agreed that Luis needed help \u2014 the Dog Whisperer himself, Cesar Millan. When Cesar saw Luis\u2019s video, he was both enchanted and horrified.\u201cCoach, you have a fantastic idea but you have no strategy,\u201d Cesar told Luis and me after we arrived at his Dog Psychology Center in Santa Clarita, Calif. We\u2019d come for two reasons: Luis loved the idea of spreading his teen-dog running program to shelters around the country, but could it be done safely? And I was hoping that whatever Luis learned about troublesome dogs could also apply to a damaged donkey.\u201cSo my run is potentially dangerous?\u201d Luis asked.Cesar continued ticking off worst-case scenarios, recalling the video in remarkable detail. The group was too bunched, he said, which could make a dog feel threatened. The kids were letting the dogs strain ahead instead of following, and the \u201cenergies\u201d were all over the place: Eager and cautious teenagers were randomly mixed and matched with anxious or assertive dogs.By the time Cesar was done, it seemed a miracle that the run hadn\u2019t ended in a ball of fangs and flying fur. That kind of analysis, he explained, is the real secret of his success.Perhaps our worst sin as pet owners, Cesar believes, is turning naturally communal canines into solitary creatures. We pluck them from litters, then raise them alone in a houseful of humans with no one to teach them how to be dogs. Often the first step for changing dangerous behavior, Cesar believes, is to simply pair dogs so one learns how to act from the other.\u201cCome on, Coach!\u201d Cesar invited Luis. \u201cTime for me to coach you.\u201dHe asked an assistant to assemble his own pack, and handed Luis the leashes of eight dogs of varying breeds and sizes. But after we\u2019d walked only a few yards, Cesar took the dogs back. \u201cYou\u2019re too anxious,\u201d he said.Cesar handed the leashes to my 12-year-old daughter Sophie, who\u2019s never owned a dog. He gave her a few pointers (head up, arms relaxed, stay in front, walk with purpose), and we began climbing a steep dirt trail. The dogs followed quietly until Sophie glanced back and pulled the leashes a little tauter. Immediately, the dogs began scattering. \u201cAlign yourself, sweetheart,\u201d Cesar said. Sophie straightened her back and lowered her arms. The dogs snapped back into formation. \u201cYou saw how a little girl did it better than you?\u201d Cesar said. \u201cThey\u2019re following the pack leader\u201dWe sat in the shade near a little waterfall Cesar built for his deceased beloved pit bull, named Daddy, while he sketched a plan for turning \u201ccrazy kids\u201d into pack leaders. First, he suggested, reboot with just a few teenagers. Pick the quietly confident ones and match them with dogs that are not too shy, not too eager. Start with a brisk walk, eyes forward, and keep a good distance apart. Before long, Cesar promised, Luis could blend in all the other kids and dogs. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is really important,\u201d he concluded. \u201cYou just have to do it right.\u201dBy that afternoon, I\u2019d absorbed a batch of tips to try on Sherman: Never use fear; dominant isn\u2019t the same as dominate. Get your own mood in order, because whatever you\u2019re feeling travels down the leash.

Robert Brearley, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony at St. Luke's Chapel in Charleston, S.C.The bride, 31, is taking her husband\u2019s name. She works in Atlanta as a vice president for retail services marketing with Citigroup. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford. Her father is a senior vice president of HBO Films in New York. Her mother is a freelance writer and a ballet teacher at Logrea Dance Academy in Ossining, N.Y.The bride is a maternal great-granddaughter of the aviators and writers Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Charles Lindbergh.The groom, 33, is a director at Trimont Real Estate Advisors in Atlanta, where he specializes in commercial real estate consulting. He graduated from the University of Georgia and received a master's in real estate from N.Y.U. His mother is an interior designer on St. Simons Island. His father retired as the chief financial officer of the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.The couple, lovers of all things shellfish, met in February 2014 at an Oysterfest in Piedmont Park in Atlanta. Both had arrived with a large group of mutual friends, and it wasn\u2019t long before Ms. Conte spotted Mr. Hodgdon, whom she hoped had spotted her first.\u201cWhen I noticed this tall, handsome, dark-haired guy looking my way, I asked a girlfriend if she knew who he was,\u201d Ms. Conte said. \u201cThen to my complete mortification, my girlfriend marched right up to him and told him that I thought he was cute.\u201dFrom the perspective of Ms. Conte, whose face took on a scarlet hue, things got a bit ugly from there. \u201cHe looked down, embarrassed, and walked away,\u201d she said.But what she didn\u2019t realize was that Mr. Hodgdon was seeing things a bit differently. \u201cIt had already been a long day of celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I wasn\u2019t in the best position to make good sense as to everything that was going on in that moment.\u201d\u201cAnna was up on a hill, and I was in no condition to walk up that hill,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cSo I just told her friend thank you, and turned away.\u201dA few days later, they crossed paths again at a bar, but never spoke.

{"Headline": "The Whatchamacallit Economy", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt\u2019s a hip, fast-growing sector of the economy, filled with headline-grabbing companies: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Task Rabbit. But there\u2019s a gnawing problem: People aren\u2019t sure what to call it. Many critics dislike the term most commonly used, the \u201csharing economy,\u201d because there often isn\u2019t much actual sharing going on. Others prefer to call it the on-demand economy, peer-to-peer economy, crowd-based economy, gig economy or collaborative economy.Uber, Lyft and other e-hailing companies love to say they are \u201cride-sharing companies,\u201d signaling that they are collaborative and not crassly capitalistic. These companies maintain that their drivers share their cars with passengers and use apps to share information about where they are. But many academics and workers in this sector assert that the business model seems less like sharing than like traditional corporate profit-making that happens to use an app.Rochelle LaPlante, who works for Mechanical Turk, an internet platform for people to post and find piecework jobs, sees public relations spin behind the term \u201csharing economy.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an exchange of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really sharing if a person\u2019s paying for it.\u201dHer point: If you\u2019re living in San Francisco and you want to drive to Palo Alto and take a friend with you (perhaps splitting the cost of gas), that\u2019s ride sharing. But if you take an Uber to get to Palo Alto, that seems more like a taxi ride.Arun Sundararajan, author of the new book \u201cThe Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism,\u201d said he chose that term for his title because so many people use it. Yet Mr. Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, actually prefers \u201ccrowd-based capitalism,\u201d because a crowd of consumers obtains services by connecting, via a platform, with a crowd of suppliers.In the early 2000s, the sharing economy generally referred to people with underused assets \u2014 whether automobiles, homes or vacuum cleaners \u2014 who let others \u201cshare\u201d them, usually for a fee. Such sharing was viewed not as a business but as a way to promote sustainability.\u201cThe \u2018sharing economy\u2019 phrase has stuck,\u201d Professor Sundararajan said, partly because it suggests a personal touch \u2014 say, an Airbnb host putting visitors up in a spare bedroom. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection that people seem to enjoy.\u201d (Even though some say that the Airbnb hosts who own a dozen apartments are not really sharing.)Ms. Botsman added that some companies can legitimately be called sharing companies, like Turo (previously called RelayRides), which enables car owners to rent out their unused cars, and BlaBlaCar, which connects riders with car owners planning to drive from one city to another.With the term \u201csharing economy\u201d under scrutiny, experts are casting about for substitutes. Miriam A. Cherry, a St. Louis University law professor, recommends the \u201con-demand economy,\u201d but critics say that isn\u2019t exact enough, because ordering a pizza by phone can be considered part of an on-demand economy. Others prefer \u201cgig economy,\u201d but some assert that phrase isn\u2019t suitable for 21st-century app-based companies because gig workers \u2014 think jazz musicians \u2014 have been around for decades.Some embrace \u201cplatform economy,\u201d but Geoffrey G. Parker, an engineering professor at Dartmouth and the author of \u201cPlatform Revolution,\u201d says that name is too broad because it includes giants like Google, Facebook and YouTube. Others like the \u201capp-based on-demand economy\u201d (the Abode economy), the \u201cgig on-demand economy\u201d (the GOD economy) or the \u201cplatform on-demand economy\u201d (the POD economy), whose workers could be called pods.Despite the criticism that \u201csharing economy\u201d is inaccurate and sounds like corporate spin, Professor Sundararajan says we might be stuck with that description because corporations and the public so often use it. When Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue latch on to a phrase, it\u2019s not easy to shake it off.Steven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Loves New York. But It Doesn\u2019t Love Him Back.", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported byThey come even in his absence, leaning against the metal barriers that line Fifth Avenue, posing for selfies and group photos or just gazing up at the soaring black tower that is home to Donald J. Trump, the president-elect of the United States.On a recent evening, with Mr. Trump out of town for a victory lap in Indiana and Ohio, a stream of tourists from around the world paused to take in the Midtown Manhattan building emblazoned with his name. A man hawking political buttons exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a feeding frenzy!\u201d Sarah Britcher, a teacher from West Virginia, said she and her friends had been shopping in the area and made a point of stopping by Trump Tower.\u201cIt seems like a more important building than it was before,\u201d Ms. Britcher, 29, said. \u201cWe just wanted to make sure we could pass by and see it.\u201d Another passer-by fumed to her companion, \u201cI wish I could throw something at it.\u201dMr. Trump has long been an intermittent source of irritation for New Yorkers, from his days as a tabloid exhibitionist to the long months of the 2016 campaign. But that clash has reached a new and potentially explosive phase since Nov. 8, as he has transformed his signature building \u2014 home to his penthouse apartment and business headquarters, and previously his campaign office \u2014 into a base of operations for his frenzied presidential transition.By signaling that he plans to keep a presence in New York after taking office in January, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has animated a confrontation unlike any in modern American politics: between a president who clings to his hometown and yearns for its affection, and a city that wishes he would simply disappear.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a pope in residence,\u201d said Michael A.L. Balboni, a Republican who was once a state legislator and served as New York State\u2019s top homeland security official.Security costs are only the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s showdown with the city. Unlike a typical president (or a pope), Mr. Trump is no local hero in the town that made him famous. His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, defeated him here by huge margins, winning every borough except Staten Island. His fellow residents of Manhattan rejected him even in the Republican primary, with a plurality in the borough voting instead for Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, an underdog in the race.Now that Mr. Trump has won, his continuing presence feels to many New Yorkers less like a source of pride than an open wound. While the president-elect has held court in his tower, receiving foreign dignitaries and candidates for his cabinet, New York\u2019s political leaders have raged against him and vowed to obstruct his agenda. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and members of Congress have traveled to the doorstep of Trump Tower to publicly chastise its most famous resident.New York has never before given the nation a president so disliked by its own voters. The last New York native to have won the presidency, Franklin D. Roosevelt, earned a festive serenade from throngs of his neighbors in Hyde Park in 1940 to celebrate his historic re-election to a third term. In contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s victory touched off days of angry protests in Midtown, where demonstrators chanted, \u201cNew York hates Trump.\u201dThere is no direct analogy for the discord between the president-elect and his hometown. For decades, American presidents have been revered in their home states during their terms: President Obama remained popular in Illinois, most of all in Chicago, regardless of his national approval ratings. George W. Bush was warmly welcomed in Texas throughout his turbulent presidency.Presidents have often established seasonal refuges or favorite vacation destinations: Mr. Bush\u2019s ranch in Crawford, Tex., for example, where he spent summer months, or the California retreats of Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Should Mr. Trump make frequent use of Mar-a-Lago, his estate and private club in Palm Beach, Fla., he might find a kind of precedent in Harry S. Truman\u2019s so-called Little White House in Key West, Fla.But no president has made a practice of taking long and frequent personal trips from the White House to a major urban area, let alone the country\u2019s largest city. And none has tried the kind of commuter relationship with the Oval Office that Mr. Trump\u2019s critics fear he may pursue.The only plausible American comparison, historians say, might be the last New York tycoon to hold national office: Nelson A. Rockefeller, who as the appointed vice president under Gerald R. Ford preferred to spend weekends in New York with his wife, Happy, and two young sons.Richard Norton Smith, a presidential historian and Rockefeller biographer, said that unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Rockefeller rarely stayed at his Fifth Avenue penthouse, preferring his Westchester County estate. And Mr. Rockefeller could travel more discreetly in that era, Mr. Smith said, with a far less disruptive security detail than is required of presidents and vice presidents today.Mr. Trump, on the other hand, plainly \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to mind generating chaos or tumult,\u201d Mr. Smith said. The notion of a president opting to avoid the White House, he added, was highly unusual.\u201cMost of these guys spend their lives turning themselves, and their families and what passes for normal conventional life, inside out in an effort to live in that house,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Yet Mr. Trump has not the slightest intention of moving out of Trump Tower as president, his associates say, or of shedding his political identity as a New Yorker. Whatever New Yorkers may think of him, his supporters around the country admire his self-developed image as an embodiment of the city\u2019s ambition, wealth and power. No property conveys that impression more forcefully than Trump Tower.In its insular luxury and regal spectacle, Mr. Trump\u2019s Manhattan residence may function more like the favorite castle of a European monarch than a typical presidential redoubt: at first a private getaway for the king, but eventually a de facto seat of government, like the palace at Versailles. In the absence of any American forebear, the building has also drawn comparisons from the worlds of science fiction and fantasy.\u201cTolkien would appreciate the spectacle of a head of state with his own tower named after him,\u201d Dan McLaughlin, a conservative columnist and lawyer based in New York, wrote on Twitter last month, alluding to the fortresses housing sinister wizards in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201dNo final decisions have been made about how Mr. Trump will divide his time after taking office, but he has conferred with friends and advisers about how often he might return to his apartment in Manhattan and visit his other properties, especially Mar-a-Lago and his country club in Bedminster, N.J.Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, and their son, Barron, are expected to stay in New York for a time, allowing Mr. Trump\u2019s youngest child to continue in his current school \u2014 and most likely intensifying the city\u2019s hold over the new commander in chief.Moreover, Mr. Trump, who weighed campaigns for mayor and governor long before running for president, still nurtures hopes of winning New York in a future election. Even at his moment of triumph on the night of the election, he expressed disappointment to associates that he did not take New York \u2014 he lost the state by 20 percentage points \u2014 and he has recently told Republicans that he hopes to win here in 2020.John Jay LaValle, the chairman of the Republican Party in Suffolk County, posted a video on his Facebook page from Mr. Trump\u2019s victory celebration on Nov. 8 that seemed to capture the president-elect\u2019s fixation on his home state.As Mr. LaValle calls out to Mr. Trump, addressing him as \u201cMr. President,\u201d Mr. Trump grins widely \u2014 but only briefly. He points at Mr. LaValle and ruefully observes, \u201cWe didn\u2019t win New York.\u201dMr. LaValle, a frequent defender of Mr. Trump on cable news shows, said Trump allies had every expectation that he would maintain a robust presence in the city. The president-elect\u2019s two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, who are among his closest advisers, are expected to continue living in New York, and Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate business, from which he has not severed his financial ties, is housed in the same building as his apartment. (His daughter Ivanka may move to Washington or split her time between the cities.)\u201cHe\u2019s going to have a pretty strong presence in New York as well as Washington, D.C.,\u201d Mr. LaValle said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to believe there\u2019ll be a White House North.\u201dTo Mr. Trump\u2019s local critics, unreasonable isn\u2019t the half of it. They view the prospect of his frequent visits with undisguised horror, for reasons that run from the symbolic to the logistical and financial. They envision capricious tunnel closings and traffic restrictions to facilitate his movement around town, parade routes sealed off to accommodate the Secret Service and raucous demonstrations rocking Manhattan routinely for four or eight years.Over the past month, Mr. de Blasio and members of the City Council have complained about the burden of securing Mr. Trump\u2019s residence, and demanded that the federal government reimburse New York for the projected $35 million in costs. (Congressional Republicans have offered a fraction of that, $7 million, to help the city.) The mayor suggested on Monday that it would be better for Mr. Trump to spend time at \u201cthat beautiful golf course in New Jersey.\u201dThe Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, said that she considered New York to be \u201cin crisis mode\u201d after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and that she was bracing for a federal assault on the city\u2019s policy priorities, including immigration, criminal justice reform and the environment. \u201cWe have to defend everything, on all fronts,\u201d she said.And Ms. Mark-Viverito bristled at Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to occupy a stretch of Fifth Avenue while in office. \u201cI find it insulting,\u201d she said, \u201cthat this president is going to be treating this job as a part-time situation, that he can come home on weekends.\u201dAs a practical matter, Gale A. Brewer, the Manhattan borough president and a Democrat, said it would be best for Mr. Trump to vacate his current residence, calling the disruption \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s never been a president who lived in a building with a whole lot of other people, in the middle of a city of eight and a half million, on an incredibly busy street,\u201d Ms. Brewer said. \u201cIt does seem to me that the family should move to Washington as soon as possible. There are very good private schools there.\u201dFailing that, she suggested, Mr. Trump might ease the tensions between him and the community by offering a gentler and more considerate public persona, and by acknowledging that he is aware of the extreme inconvenience. \u201cIt would be different for him to apologize to New Yorkers, explain why he\u2019s coming back and forth and what the situation is,\u201d she said.Security experts say, too, that the threat New York must now address extends beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s best-known property to more than a dozen proudly branded structures around the city. Mr. Balboni, the former state homeland security official, cautioned that for homegrown terrorists seeking to attack \u201csomething that is near and close by,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s less-guarded real estate assets would be inviting targets for violence and mayhem.Mr. Trump\u2019s other properties lack the overwhelming protective measures of his primary residence. While Fifth Avenue swarmed with armed guards even during Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to the Midwest, there were no police officers, or any other evident security measures, visible at a Trump-connected apartment building a few blocks away on Central Park South. And though he does not actually own all of the properties on which his name appears, Trump-branded buildings dot the city, including an office tower on Wall Street and a hotel in Columbus Circle.Mr. Trump seems to be aware of the cooperation he will need from at least some city and state officials to function in New York or to govern as president. So he has taken a few fitful steps to improve relations with prominent residents. He has praised Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic minority leader, and agreed to reappoint Preet Bharara, a former adviser to Mr. Schumer, as the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.Mr. Trump has made other sporadic gestures of reconciliation, meeting with Mr. de Blasio (they kept the details of their conversation confidential) and placing an unexpected phone call to the Rev. Al Sharpton, a periodic Trump antagonist for decades. And the president-elect spoke at length with former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a political independent who criticized Mr. Trump sharply during the campaign.To the extent that Mr. Trump wants to woo New York\u2019s elite to the White House, he will soon have the ceremonial instruments of the presidency at his disposal: invitations to state dinners and holiday parties, embassy postings and appointments to various r\u00e9sum\u00e9-enhancing government boards. In early December, he formed an august-sounding advisory panel \u2014 the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum \u2014 and named Stephen A. Schwarzman, the billionaire New York financier and Republican-leaning political donor, to lead it.Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party and a supporter of Mr. Trump, said the president-elect nurtured a deep desire to win New York in an election, though it has not voted Republican in a presidential race since Reagan\u2019s 49-state landslide in 1984. \u201cHe was always telling me: \u2018We\u2019re going to win New York,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cHe would love to win New York; there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201dThat appears unlikely, given the furious backlash against Mr. Trump\u2019s election this year. State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat who led an effort to remove Mr. Trump\u2019s name from a small state park just outside the city, said he held two town-hall-style meetings in November that were flooded with people asking how to \u201csave the republic\u201d from Mr. Trump.Still, Mr. Squadron, who represents parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, allowed that Mr. Trump, as president-elect, might have a bit of leeway to change people\u2019s minds. For now, Mr. Squadron said he would not reintroduce legislation to rename Donald J. Trump State Park and would \u201cgive him the opportunity to govern.\u201dMr. Squadron did not rule out reviving the bill, though, depending on how Mr. Trump handled himself in office.\u201cSimply being a New Yorker and president,\u201d he warned, \u201cdoes not mean that New York will be proud of you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tent Cities of San Francisco", "Date": "2016-12-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California may be the new capital of American liberalism, but everybody who likes the sound of that ought to consider the fate of three recent San Francisco ballot initiatives.The first, Proposition Q, aimed to eliminate homeless people\u2019s unsightly tent camps by banning sidewalk tents and empowering the police to confiscate them with 24 hours notice so long as occupants were offered beds in shelters. San Francisco has only 1,203 emergency adult shelter beds, for a homeless population of 6,700, but a second initiative, Proposition J, promised to ease that shortfall by earmarking $50 million a year from a small sales-tax increase, proposed in a third initiative, Proposition K.In an exquisite illustration of California\u2019s core political neurosis \u2014 the tension between our attachment to the pretty view and our desire to care for the least among us without personal inconvenience, even as our population and economy explode \u2014 we San Franciscans voted yes on Q and J, and no on K. The people spoke, in other words, and we said, \u201cGet rid of those filthy tents and set aside heaps of money to make sure it\u2019s done in a compassionate way so I don\u2019t have to feel guilty, but don\u2019t squeeze me for a dime.\u201dSimilar contradictions were on display this month, after the Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland killed 36 people. We lamented the deaths, but it was easier to criticize the warehouse owner and operator than face the desperation that drove so many to live there.San Francisco\u2019s homeless population, it bears mentioning, increased less than 7 percent over the last 10 years. Tent camps are nothing new. According to Jeff Kositsky, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, what has changed is their visibility. Tech-boom construction has filled empty lots where people \u201cexperiencing homelessness\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the preferred term \u2014 formerly slept in seclusion.\u201cWe also had one individual purchase and give away $15,000 worth of camping tents,\u201d Mr. Kositsky told me. \u201cOther organizations were giving them out as well, and now we\u2019ve got 80 encampments in the city.\u201d The individual in question turned out to be a graphic designer named Shaun Osburn who told me that, with help from a former taxi driver named Tara Spalty, he gave away more than 350 tents.This camp reportedly had 350 residents at one point, including a slumlord (tentlord?) who rented his spare tents for a few bucks a week. Conventional wisdom holds that such places are populated by drug addicts and the mentally ill, and elements of that camp supported this, from piles of garbage to apparent meth heads toiling over piles of disassembled bicycles. There was something so sane, however, about the tidy rows into which all these tents were arranged that it brought to mind a national-park campground.This resonance was not lost on the tent dwellers. Crystal Erickson, a 36-year-old who had been homeless for three years, told me, ruefully, \u201cWe call it the urban camping experience.\u201dNearby, on Seventh Street, another group built wooden shanties along a narrow strip of concrete between a street that clogs with rush-hour traffic and a railway that roars with commuter trains in the shadow of a sprawling new biotech center. Germaine Spann, a member of this crew, told me that he scavenged materials from the Dumpsters at the immense luxury-condo construction site that loomed overhead. He scaled his boxlike home for legal parking spaces, built it on wheels for easy relocation, installed a lockable door and a glass window, and painted a sign that said: \u201cBox City 7th Street. They may look like boxes to you, but to us they are home.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re ships,\u201d said Jason Albertson, a member of the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team. \u201cEverybody\u2019s building a lifeboat and living in it.\u201dSimilar outbreaks of ad hoc shelter appeared elsewhere around California and, indeed, all over the West Coast and even Hawaii. In Los Angeles, where the total homeless population grew 11 percent from 2015 to 2016 \u2014 to an astonishing 28,464 people \u2014 the number of makeshift dwellings grew 85 percent. In San Diego, the homeless population declined while those in handmade shelters grew 69 percent. Sacramento was so overwhelmed by tent dwellers that the city is contemplating creating a \u201csafe ground\u201d zone, while Santa Barbara has designated \u201csafe parking\u201d lots for people who occupy vehicles.Activists soon gathered signatures for ballot initiatives like Proposition HHH in Los Angeles, which aimed to create a $1.2 billion bond for new supportive and affordable housing as well as facilities, and Measure A in Santa Clara County, which authorized a $950 million bond for affordable housing.Public outcry included disbelief that our wealthy progressive city allows people to suffer so; assertions that our homeless come from elsewhere because of the warm weather and San Francisco\u2019s generous public services; and the notorious \u201cTech Bro\u201d letter of Feb. 15, addressed to the mayor and police chief by an entrepreneur named Justin Keller. Mr. Keller announced that he had been living in San Francisco \u201cfor over three years,\u201d declared homelessness \u201cthe worst it has ever been,\u201d and shrugged off culpability as an agent of gentrification.Mr. Kositsky, the city official, did not entirely disagree. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to demonize people who complain, who want their kids safe and don\u2019t want to step on needles and feces and be kept up all night by loud music,\u201d he told me.Patrick Kennedy, a developer, proposed solving the problem with micro-apartments that look like shipping containers (fabrication to be outsourced to China, of course), stacked into supportive communities, and rented to the city at $1,000 a month. Meanwhile, with the financial backing of wealthy investors, Supervisor Mark Farrell, a moderate who represents affluent neighborhoods, placed Proposition Q on the ballot.Mr. Keller seems like a smart fellow. He has doubtless learned by now that homelessness is decidedly not the worst it has ever been in San Francisco and also that it ranks up there with sunshine among California\u2019s defining phenomena. As The San Francisco Chronicle reported in October, the South of Market district favored by tech firms like Mr. Keller\u2019s has been a gathering place for the homeless since at least 1872, when an observer noted the concentration of \u201cblanket men\u201d who seemed to be mostly \u201crunaway sailors,\u201d \u201cold soldiers\u201d and \u201cbankrupt German scene painters.\u201d The city\u2019s homeless population peaked at 8,640 in 2002.Californian outrage over homelessness is likewise evergreen, as documented by the journalist Caleb Pershan, who found examples that ranged from a 1986 Chronicle columnist\u2019s comment that \u201cthe annual homeless crisis came to San Francisco early this year\u201d to a 2001 article mocking Mayor Willie Brown\u2019s belated acknowledgment that homelessness harmed the city\u2019s image \u2014 \u201cstunning the many merchants and residents who have been sounding that theme since the beginning of the mayor\u2019s first term six years ago.\u201dMr. Keller is less an outlier rube, in other words, than a genuine Californian, struggling to reconcile the Golden State of our shared dreams with unsettling evidence. Grumblings that our homeless come from elsewhere for services express that denial by insisting that we are too compassionate \u2014 not inadequately so \u2014 and therefore bear no responsibility for losers who wash up on our sidewalks. It is not immaterial that newcomers really do keep showing up in droves, in California, and that people who got here yesterday have a long history of feeling unnerved by those who arrived 10 minutes ago. Dust Bowl migrants, for example, were so resented that legislators passed a 1937 \u201canti-Okie\u201d law a that criminalized the bringing of \u201cany indigent person\u201d into California.San Francisco city statistics, meanwhile, suggest that most of our homeless are as Californian as anyone with a roof over their heads. A one-night census of the homeless in January 2015 found that 71 percent had lived here at the time they became homeless, and half of those had lived in San Francisco for 10 or more years.I recently heard a tech-industry veteran \u2014 a friend, born on the East Coast \u2014 suggest that proposals to build low-income housing here were misguided because of the high cost of California real estate. A more efficient alternative, he explained, would be to construct homeless shelters somewhere cheap, like Nevada. Aside from the unpleasant specter of the police forcing desperate mothers and children onto buses bound for desert concentration camps (and how long would you have to be homeless to get exiled?), my friend\u2019s remark helped me see what lurks beneath Mr. Keller\u2019s contention that wealthy people have a right to be here because they \u201cgot an education, work hard, and earned it.\u201dAmericans have been coming to California to make it big for so long \u2014 on wagons bound for the Gold Rush, via Route 66 for 1950s aerospace jobs \u2014 that a tacit understanding flourishes in certain quarters by which California is less a homeland full of locals like anywhere else than a reality show with a self-deportation approach to voting contestants off the island. As soon as you can\u2019t pay the bills, and regardless of whether your great-grandparents were born here, you\u2019re expected to get lost, or at least move to Seattle.Discussion of causes, along with the noise about weather and drug addiction, typically includes Ronald Reagan\u2019s evisceration of federal funding for subsidized housing and public mental health hospitals. Conventional homeless shelters get blamed, too, because of their tendency to separate romantic partners and forbid both pets and the storage of belongings \u2014 such that a few nights indoors might cost a person love, companionship and all their survival gear.Frigid New York City, however, has more homeless per capita than San Francisco or Los Angeles, while only 7 percent of Los Angeles homeless arrived less than a year ago, fewer than the 8.5 percent of all Los Angeles County residents to have done so, suggesting that sunshine is no more of an inducement to the destitute than to anyone else. National surveys also find that 20 percent to 25 percent of the homeless have serious mental health problems and an estimated 26 percent abuse drugs. San Francisco has also pioneered a new model of homeless shelter, known as a Navigation Center, that invites entire encampments \u2014 pets included \u2014 to come in from the cold together.The economic factors that correlate most strongly with homelessness, furthermore, according to research published in 2001 by the Public Policy Institute of California, are precisely those that bedevil every aspect of California life: extreme income inequality combined with upward-spiraling housing costs. For decades, even as employment booms have led to population booms, California voters \u2014 myself among them \u2014 have fought to freeze the good life in amber by resisting increases in housing density and mass transit.Viewed in this light, sidewalk tents are merely a rational response to an incoherent society.Californians came together for public works in the mid-20th century \u2014 freeways, public housing, the finest public schools and universities in the nation. Caring for the least among us, however, has never been a hallmark of California liberalism, and our most notable innovations of the past 50 years have been more about environmental conservation, tolerance and technology \u2014 sustainable agriculture, gay marriage, Snapchat \u2014 than formation of mutual aid societies, except for communes and cults that end with industrial-scale marijuana cultivation or mass suicide. The technology industry takes this to a millennial extreme by celebrating the moral neutrality enshrined in Google\u2019s corporate motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil.\u201dOn the upside, our political leaders \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown chief among them \u2014 see with clarity that our only defensible path forward involves the end of Nimby resistance to change and the mass construction of denser housing and public transit guided by enlightened city planning to create a more livable and sustainable future. Voters all over California did pass big bond measures in support of new housing for the homeless, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, recently made a $10 million gift meant to eliminate family homelessness in San Francisco. Facebook has likewise announced plans to create 1,500 units of housing near its Menlo Park headquarters \u2014 a colossal political breakthrough, in our stunted moral climate \u2014 with 15 percent designated affordable and $20 million dedicated to the development of still more affordable housing and tenants\u2019 rights services.In the meantime, San Francisco city employees can start giving all those tent dwellers 24 hours notice to clear out, backed by offers of, well, pretty much nothing at all.Advertisement"}

Clay Higgins of the St. Landry Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office was standing before a camera for a Crime Stoppers video, lecturing three at-large suspects in the thefts of several four-wheelers.In mid-December of this year, Mr. Higgins won a seat in Congress.The victory, in a Dec. 10 runoff, was at once shocking and almost predictable: It represented both a stunning upset by a political novice with a baggage train of alleged transgressions against a veteran officeholder and favorite son in Cajun country, and an entirely natural outcome for an election season like this one.While anti-establishment outsiders have long competed in congressional races, they have typically come up short. Veteran politicians are seen as safer bets against partisan opponents in a general election. But Mr. Higgins benefited from Louisiana\u2019s curious election system \u2014 a nonpartisan primary followed by a top-two runoff. So he was running against a fellow Republican after voters had already seen that a rough-edged, anti-establishment outsider \u2014 Donald J. Trump \u2014 could actually win.\u201cI\u2019m a candidate of We the People, and I believe Trump was also the candidate of We the People,\u201d Mr. Higgins said in a brief telephone interview from Washington, where he is scrambling to set up his office.\u201cI admire the man, and I look forward to working with him,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I am no man\u2019s puppet.\u201dMr. Higgins and Mr. Trump would seem to have little in common personally \u2014 Mr. Higgins is far from a millionaire, and, in contrast with the president-elect, he does have experience in public service. But there are parallels.One other similarity: Both men gained fame before running for office, for things having nothing to do with politics.About a dozen years ago, after many years running car dealerships, Mr. Higgins, 55, decided to enter law enforcement, eventually becoming the public information officer for the St. Landry Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office. He was the face of Crime Stoppers videos, which are pleas to the public for help in unsolved crimes.Mr. Higgins drew an ardent following to his videos, with a mixture of benevolent rhetoric about inherent goodness and redemption, and rather less humanitarian talk about \u201cheathens,\u201d \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d who would be quickly shot down if they tried to fight back.This all came to an end in February. Mr. Higgins \u201cresigned as a matter of principle\u201d from the sheriff\u2019s office, having been told, he said without elaboration, to follow orders that would have violated his conscience.He declined to offer specifics about those orders, which the sheriff, Bobby Guidroz, outlined in a statement: Tone down the \u201cdisrespectful and demeaning\u201d commentary on the videos, and stop trying to run a personal business out of the sheriff\u2019s office, selling \u201cmugs, T-shirts and other trinkets using department badge and uniform.\u201dReached for comment, Sheriff Guidroz said he did not want to discuss a former employee, but he did add that Mr. Higgins had been promoted to captain, a title he still uses, only because that rank was required to obtain certain information to prepare news releases.Mr. Higgins said he and his wife were not sure what to do after his resignation, praying for signs of guidance. The signs came, he said, in the form of thousands of phone calls and Facebook messages from fans.\u201cProbably over 2,000 of them,\u201d he said, \u201cwere from patriots of every shade of ideology and every color and creed, ethnicity and heritage, solid American men and women across the country, imploring me to seek federal office.\u201dHe said he had settled on a run in the Third Congressional District \u2014 he lives just outside it \u2014 after considering two others. The choice had much to do with the presumed front-runner: Scott Angelle, a longtime state officeholder who is from a well-known Cajun political family.A year ago, Mr. Angelle, a Republican, was considered unbeatable here. He came in third in a nine-candidate primary for governor in 2015, but romped in Cajun country, beating his Republican rivals in nearly every parish of this congressional district.But things changed.Republicans remained angry about Mr. Angelle\u2019s decision, after a bitter primary, not to endorse David Vitter in the runoff for governor. Distaste lingered more broadly for politicians, like Mr. Angelle, who played significant roles in the still-unpopular administration of Gov. Bobby Jindal. Mr. Angelle had also developed serious in-state political rivals, including Mr. Vitter, whose former chief of staff ran a political action committee, unsubtly called Make Louisiana Great Again, that vigorously attacked Mr. Angelle in the congressional race.There were other issues raised about Mr. Angelle\u2019s record, but in the season of Trump, none seemed more harmful than this: He had been a politician for a long time.\u201cThat slogan about draining the swamp in Washington really resonated,\u201d said Larry Miller, 80, a retired school principal who now fixes accordions in the little town of Iota. \u201cCaptain Higgins was a non-swamp guy. With Angelle being an establishment guy, he was sort perceived as part of the swamp.\u201dAn aversion to swamps may seem rather unusual in south Louisiana; the politicians whom people here have traditionally sent to Washington \u2014 canny operators like former Representative Edwin Edwards and the longtime House member and senator John Breaux \u2014 were masters at navigating the political swamp. But while the voters have kept their famed tolerance for personal failings, they have become much less tolerant of politicians.\u201cWhen a marriage falls apart, who doesn\u2019t bicker about child support?\u201d said Jacquelyn Waldrep, an assistant manager at the Rice Palace, a popular 24-hour restaurant connected to a truck stop casino here. Ms. Waldrep, 61, got this job after retiring as a state employee and learning to her frustration that she would have to pay a penalty for not having health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. This kind of thing, she said, explains the appeal of Mr. Higgins, who drew an enthusiastic crowd when he came to the Rice Palace to speak at one of the Tuesday afternoon Lions Club meetings.\u201cThe middle class and working people are tired of paying the way for everybody,\u201d Ms. Waldrep said.In the runoff, Mr. Higgins won this parish, the unofficial seat of old-fashioned Cajun politics, by a ratio of more than two to one.\u201cI\u2019ve been in elections for 50 years \u2014 mayor, council, governor, congress, U.S. Senate,\u201d Mr. Broadhurst said. \u201cYou can take all that and forget it. It\u2019s a whole new dynamic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Put on a sweater emblazoned with a cat wearing a Santa hat on the front. (Any kind of cat \u2014 calico, Siamese, Abyssinian \u2014 will do.)2. Stand next to an elevator. (It wouldn\u2019t hurt to put on some perfume or cologne; this plan needs all the help it can get.)Then, boom! Mr. or Ms. Right will pop up.We can\u2019t swear by this, because our data is admittedly scant.

But you can\u2019t argue with success, which is why these cat-and-elevator couples lead the list of the most unusual how-we-met stories for 2016. The catless among us fared just as well, however. Here is our list:Mr. Ponder wore his Christmas cat sweater for the picture he posted on his Tinder profile in summer 2014, and Ms. Landy was intrigued by his sense of humor.Mr. Rader and Ms. Callaway met in December 2013 in Nashville when Mr. Rader and a friend (who was wearing a Christmas cat sweater) were hailing the same cab as Ms. Callaway (who was also wearing a cat sweater) and her friend.\u201cMeow,\u201d Mr. Rader\u2019s friend said to Ms. Callaway, but she wound up with Mr. Rader.Asked recently to explain the romantic allure of Santa-cat sweaters, Mr. Rader said a number of factors came into play.\u201cBut No. 1 would be the actual girl wearing the sweater,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition to her, it\u2019s a celebration of the most beautiful and wonderful time of the year, and to have a cat wearing a Santa hat is just something that is friendly and welcoming and cheerful all wrapped into one.\u201dMs. Carbone remembered seeing her future husband in the elevator of their Philadelphia apartment building. \u201cHe looked charming, handsome and dapper in his nice suits,\u201d she said. Then the two got the chance to chat when an early-morning fire alarm rousted the pair and their fellow tenants and temporarily left them outside.Ms. Gaya recalls hitting the button on her elevator in her Brooklyn apartment building and out walked Mr. Martin. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018That\u2019s the hottest guy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019\u201d They were introduced by the woman showing an apartment to Mr. Martin, but she did not get his last name. A few months later, they again met at the elevator and began to get better acquainted.Ms. Lindhorst did not actually spot Mr. Sokoloff in the elevator. But her roommate, a natural matchmaker, had. Ms. Lindhorst, with encouragement from her roommate, then sent a Facebook friend request to \u201cthe really attractive guy\u201d she saw there.\u201cStanding ahead of me was this stunning woman,\u201d Mr. Mankiewicz, a correspondent for \u201cDateline NBC,\u201d recalled. \u201cI was staring at her.

She wore a black blazer and jeans, sang four songs, and tested out some new glasses by reading about 10 poems.\u201cYesterday was the pope\u2019s birthday and I think, Keith Richards\u2019s birthday,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have the whole spectrum there.\u201d (Mr. Richards\u2019s 73rd birthday was, in fact, Sunday.)The show was unannounced, but employees and patrons of the museum were made aware of it ahead of time, the result being a classic Gotham crowd: a mix of those in the know, those alerted by friends in the know and dozens of others who were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.Through the first half of her hourlong performance, Ms. Smith honored the spirit of Mr. Genet. She played the songs \u201cWing\u201d and \u201cMy Blakean Year\u201d and read poems dedicated to the playwright and actor Sam Shepard and the photographer Diane Arbus.Ms. Smith recalled running into Ms. Arbus at the Chelsea Hotel decades earlier: \u201cShe always had a camera and she was always in a bad mood.

She read a portion of a poem dedicated to the artist Robert Mapplethorpe, the friend about whom she wrote the best-selling memoir \u201cJust Kids.\u201d That work, released in 2010, introduced her to a new generation of fans, including three young Belgians who were in Harlem when they were alerted to the performance on Facebook Live but arrived too late to witness it.But with three final pieces, Ms. Smith addressed the postelection climate, without mentioning the name of the president-elect. She read a poem that she said was about having the resilience to resist darkness, and another dedicated to Jesse Paris Smith, her daughter, because \u201cour sons and daughters are the hope of the world.\u201d\u201cOur artists and our leaders can inspire us,\u201d Ms. Smith said, introducing the song, which she performed with the help of Omer Leibovitz, a guitarist and audio engineer who works at the museum and had not known he would be accompanying Ms. Smith when he arrived at work that day. \u201cBut the people, in our real numbers, are the ones who make change. The only way we can make change is to unify.\u201dMs. Smith received the most enthusiastic applause when she sang about \u201cthe power to dream, to rule, to wrestle the world from fools.\u201d\u201cAnd we can wrestle you,\u201d she shouted, interrupting herself to curse gleefully as the audience clapped and cheered.Follow Jonah Engel Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman.Advertisement"}

The $370 billion online retailer, which trades not far short of 100 times its skinny forecast earnings, achieves that outsize multiple partly on the belief that there\u2019s a sort of dial that the founder and boss, Jeff Bezos, can turn to stop giving consumers such good deals and slow down investment, making a huge profit suddenly appear.Perhaps the same applies to Uber, which is still losing $100 million per quarter even in its home market, The Information says, partly thanks to intense competition with its rival Lyft \u2014 not to mention aggressive market-share grabs from traditional taxis in big markets like New York City. To begin to justify its paper valuation, even at an Amazon- and Facebook-like enterprise value-to-Ebitda ratio of around 40, the company led by Travis Kalanick needs to turn its current loss into approaching $2 billion of positive Ebitda \u2014 a swing near $5 billion.With plenty of cash in the bank, Uber has time, and it is still expanding. But to help assess whether there is enough juice in its chosen markets, there is a concept in economics called the consumer surplus. It is a measure of the gap between what people are willing to pay for goods or services and what they actually pay.A group of economists under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research, among them the \u201cFreakonomics\u201d co-author Steven Levitt, analyzed a trove of big data from Uber. Because of the way the company deploys what it calls surge pricing \u2014 higher fares at times of high demand \u2014 they were able to investigate passengers\u2019 sensitivity to prices.This allowed the economists to estimate the consumer surplus enjoyed by users of Uber\u2019s most-used UberX service across its four biggest American markets \u2014 Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. They concluded that the surplus was $2.9 billion in 2015. Those cities made up 43 percent of the company\u2019s domestic gross bookings, so nationally the figure could be nearly $7 billion. The surplus is equivalent to 1.6 times what users actually paid, excluding surge pricing.Such a result implies there might be room for Uber to raise prices once it has saturated any given market, without taking away all the economic benefit customers currently enjoy. But it is not so simple given competition from both the likes of Lyft and taxi fleets.Take New York City. Add another assumption to the mix and divide the researchers\u2019 figure up according to city population, and the consumer surplus from UberX in the metropolis was about $1.5 billion last year.As for the Big Apple\u2019s iconic yellow taxis, another economist, Nicholas Buchholz at the University of Texas at Austin, used data that is now a few years old to conclude that the New York taxi industry generated a consumer surplus of some $260 million a year, with taxi industry profit amounting to an annual $1.6 billion.Looked at another way, there are 13,587 licensing medallions riveted to the hoods of yellow New York taxis. Near the peak, coinciding roughly with Mr. Buchholz\u2019s data, these were worth around $1.2 million each, according to statistics from New York\u2019s Taxi & Limousine Commission. Assume a capitalization multiple of 10 times, and that kind of price tag represents a proxy for profit over and above daily taxi running costs worth \u2014 reassuringly \u2014 around $1.6 billion a year.With Uber use exploding since then, it is not surprising that the near-monopoly riches available to taxi owners and operators have plunged. The value of a medallion has crashed to $500,000 or less. The same assumptions suggest the taxi industry now collects maybe $700 million a year over and above daily costs.The lost benefit has not all suddenly gone to taxi passengers. More likely, with the typical New York cab snagging roughly 10 percent fewer rides in 2015 than a year earlier, it has gone to Uber or, more accurately, to Uber\u2019s customers. The Silicon Valley interloper has also enlarged the market, adding far more rides than taxis have lost.Uber may choose to undercut taxis slightly, but it is about more than price. As Mr. Buchholz points out in his paper, traditional taxis forgo huge economic benefit by not being able to link customers waiting on street corners with empty vehicles \u2014 both geographically and in terms of matching overall demand and supply at any given time. Uber\u2019s app, its algorithms and the added twist of price flexibility help it capture this value.For now, Uber\u2019s Mr. Kalanick seems content for the gains to flow mainly to customers. Whether he has an Amazon-like knob to turn, though, is an open question. Taxis in New York and elsewhere are figuring out their own apps and algorithms to address the matching issue. And if Uber does put prices up, it will open the door for competitors. Above all, consumers like their surplus, and they became accustomed to it. Unless the company ends up with its own quasi-monopoly, grabbing a big chunk of that back for investors may prove a very bumpy road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clean Energy \u2018Moving Forward\u2019 Despite Trump\u2019s E.P.A. Pick, Experts Say", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice of a fossil-fuel advocate and climate-change denier to head the Environmental Protection Agency comes at a moment when the American energy market has already shifted away from the most polluting fossil fuels, driven more by investors and economics than by federal regulations.Those market forces could make Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to create at least half a million energy jobs a year in the nation\u2019s coal mines and oil shale fields all but impossible.But if Mr. Trump\u2019s promised jobs are unlikely to materialize, the impact on the planet from his policies would be significant. Without additional government policies, energy and environmental experts say, the shift from coal, oil and natural gas will not be rapid or substantial enough to stave off the worst impacts of a warming atmosphere, including rising sea levels, more powerful storms, more devastating droughts and food and water shortages.\u201cThe good news is that on its own, the U.S. economy has become less carbon intensive, and that trend will continue overall,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. The bad news, he said, is that markets alone will not lower emissions enough to offset the worst impacts of global warming.President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan was already criticized for not doing enough. Even if the plan was implemented, it would not reach the targets set under last year\u2019s Paris climate change accord, which committed nearly every country to take action to curb global warming. The targets \u201cwill be unachievable,\u201d Mr. Stavins said.\u201cMr. Pruitt will be deeply involved in the implementation of President-elect Trump\u2019s energy plan, which will move America toward energy independence, create millions of new jobs and protect clean air and water,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMr. Pruitt will ensure that we conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources, while unleashing an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.\u201dThat rebalancing of priorities, the president-elect said, will create \u201cat least a half million jobs each year\u201d and \u201c$30 billion in higher wages.\u201dA Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions.The irony of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s zeal to target President Obama\u2019s climate change and environmental rules, which focus on reducing carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, is that many of the nation\u2019s largest electric utilities \u2014 the entities that would be regulated under the plan \u2014 have already begun plans to shutter coal plants and build new wind and solar farms.Even the chief executives of coal companies agree that Mr. Pruitt can only do so much to restore the industry.Mr. Pruitt \u201cis going to do what needs to be done at the E.P.A. \u2014 to cut the numbers of bureaucrats there who have done nothing but write regulations daily, and send them back to the radical environmentalists who wrote them,\u201d said Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of the Ohio-based Murray Energy Corporation.However, he added, \u201cCoal can\u2019t come back to where it was.\u201dThe plummeting cost of wind and solar energy, helped along by federal tax incentives, has led to a boom in the use of such \u201cno-carbon\u201d power sources. And the nation\u2019s largest electric utilities, many of which have joined Mr. Pruitt in his lawsuit against the climate regulations, have at the same time realigned their long-term investment strategies.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Nicholas Akins, chief executive officer of American Electric Power, an Ohio-based electric utility that generates power in 11 states, said in an interview shortly after Election Day that his company is making investments in energy generation aimed at 20, 30 and 40 years from now. Whether or not Mr. Trump dismantles the Clean Power Plan, he said he assumes that in the long run, carbon pollution will eventually be regulated.\u201cClean Power Plan or not, there will be something in the future on carbon control. So there\u2019s no question that the industry is moving forward with cleaner energy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be building large coal facilities. We\u2019re not stopping what we\u2019re doing based on the new administration. We need to make long-term capital decisions. I don\u2019t think the course will change.\u201dBut company-driven shifts alone will still not be enough to create the steep drop-off in carbon pollution that scientists say is necessary. The use of wind power grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and the end of 2015, while the use of large-scale solar grew by more than 20 times in that same period, according to the Energy Information Administration. But renewable sources, excluding hydroelectric power, still only represent a small fraction of the American energy economy, providing just a little more than 7 percent of the country\u2019s electricity.Carbon dioxide emissions peaked in 2007 at six billion metric tons, declining slightly to 5.4 billion metric tons by 2014. But they would need to decline to about 4.8 billion metric tons annually by 2025 and 1.2 billion metric tons annually by 2050 if the United States is to meet its pledges under the Paris accord.\u201cTo get there would require reducing emissions about 5 percent per year over the next decades. In order to reduce that fast, we would need to be avoiding new fossil fuel infrastructure and actively shutting down old fossil fuel infrastructure before the end of its natural life,\u201d said Andrew Jones, the director of Climate Interactive, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible without aggressive federal policy.\u201dAt the same time, analysts are skeptical that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back the climate change rules would bring back the tens of thousands of mining jobs that have been lost in the market shift away from coal, let alone create large numbers of new jobs. Electric utilities like American Electric Power turned away from investing in coal largely because of the glut of cheap natural gas, thanks to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\u201cThe market defines the opportunities for coal,\u201d said Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan research firm. \u201cElectric utilities that have shut down coal plants are not going to reopen them. Mines that have been mothballed because they are not economic are not going to be taken out of mothballs.\u201dHe said coal could at least remain a part of America\u2019s energy mix if Mr. Pruitt made headway in removing cumbersome regulations \u2014 and if he could successfully strip away subsidies for renewables. Last year, the federal government paid out $2.2 billion in tax incentives to the industry and $1 billion to the solar industry. The wind incentive is set to start declining in value next year until it ends in 2020, while the investment credit for solar is to phase out between 2019 and 2022.\u201cWe\u2019re paying taxes to manufacture windmills. You give me billions of dollars, and I\u2019ll create jobs,\u201d Mr. Murray, the coal company executive, said.But despite the opposition of the coal industry and incoming administration to climate change policy, the tax incentives, which have been enacted by Congress in both Democratic and Republican majorities for over a decade, are unlikely to disappear. Among their greatest beneficiaries are the windswept, sun-soaked districts in Republican strongholds like Kansas, Texas and Arizona, and Rust Belt districts that manufacture wind turbines and solar panels.\u201cI don\u2019t see those renewable tax incentives going away anytime soon,\u201d Mr. Book said. \u201cVoters in many of these Trump districts are benefiting from them.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi, Diane Cardwell and Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The two men are being appointed as co-directors of Uber\u2019s new in-house research arm on artificial intelligence, which the ride-hailing company unveiled on Monday. The research arm\u2019s aim is to apply A.I. in areas like self-driving vehicles, along with solving other technological challenges through machine learning.All 15 people from the start-up will be absorbed by Uber. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The acquisition and new research arm, which will be called Uber\u2019s A.I. Labs, exemplifies how seriously Silicon Valley tech companies are betting on artificial intelligence. Google, Facebook and others have also pushed into artificial intelligence, which underlies voice recognition software, digital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, and technologies like self-driving cars. Many companies are racing to bring on new A.I. talent to compete against one another.\u201cEvery major company realizes how essential A.I. is to what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Dr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of data people are operating on, even the smallest gains in efficiency can turn out enormous changes at these companies, especially in terms of profit.\u201dMany of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, have tried to commercialize artificial intelligence through the application of algorithms modeled largely on how the human brain functions. This method, called deep learning, leans heavily on the vast data sets that private technology companies own and that are used to train computers to do simple tasks, such as match patterns or recognize faces in photographs.Part of what drew Uber to Dr. Marcus\u2019s team is that his start-up is tackling artificial intelligence in a different way. Rather than taking just one approach like deep learning, Geometric Intelligence combines data scientists who use varying techniques to study artificial intelligence, including the Bayesian and \u201cevolutionary\u201d methods.Dr. Marcus, who helped found Geometric Intelligence in late 2014, said the gist of his philosophy goes something like this: Instead of training machines by feeding them enormous amounts of data, what if computers were capable of learning more like humans by extrapolating a system of rules from just a few or even a single example?Besides autonomous vehicles, Uber said it expected its A.I. Labs to apply its method to other tasks, including combating fraud, extracting information from street signs and learning to improve its mapping research and capabilities.\u201cWhen step function changes in this field occur, we\u2019re going to see very significant differences in how businesses run themselves,\u201d Jeff Holden, Uber\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview. He said the A.I. Labs and Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, which is home to the company\u2019s self-driving car research, will work in tandem with each other.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long time before a self-driving car will be able to make all the kinds of trips that Uber does every single day,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cBut the answers to this are all going to come in the form of artificial intelligence.\u201dMr. Holden said recruiting A.I. research talent is highly competitive, especially as Google, Apple and Tesla are also developing self-driving cars or related projects.\u201cFrom a defensive perspective, if someone else develops them first, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a new co-director of Uber\u2019s in-house research arm on artificial intelligence.

Mr. Velez did not disclose the private company\u2019s current valuation.The investment comes at a time when the broader financial technology sector in Brazil is gaining traction.Last week, the online trading platform XP Investimentos, backed by the private equity firm General Atlantic, said it had acquired Rico, another online investment platform. It paid approximately 400 million reais, or $116.7 million, according to Isaias Sznifer, a principal at Greenhill & Company in Brazil, the firm that advised Rico\u2019s founding shareholders on the deal.\u201cWe think there\u2019s a lot of interest, both from local and international players in the space, and we expect to see a number of transactions in the full spectrum of fintech in the coming 12 to 24 months,\u201d said Mr. Sznifer, a former Goldman Sachs vice president.Nubank provides a digital credit card for smartphones. It is looking to take customers away from Brazil\u2019s highly profitable banks.The start-up, based in S\u00e3o Paulo, was founded in 2013, and it rolled out its credit card in 2014.Brazil has some of the highest interest rates among emerging economies even after the country\u2019s central bank has recently begun to lower its benchmark Selic rate for the first time since 2012.The average annual interest rate for credit cards as of October was 119.7 percent, up from 97.5 percent in October 2015, according to data from Brazil\u2019s Central Bank.Nubank\u2019s monthly interest rate ranges from 2.75 percent to 14 percent, depending on a customer\u2019s credit history. Even that upper rate is lower than the average rates offered by Brazil\u2019s largest banks, according to the most recent weekly central bank data.Mr. Velez, a former Sequoia Capital partner, said the new financing was \u201ca bit more of growth capital to expand our customer base.\u201dHe said the company, which now has 392 employees, has received more than seven million applications for its card and has more than half a million people on a wait list.\u201cTo sustain our growth, we need to put the capital into systems, infrastructure, in people, and make sure we maintain really good customer service and great technology and infrastructure,\u201d he added.Nubank also faces growing competition from Brazil\u2019s traditional banks. Santander Brasil recently introduced a competing product, as did Banco CBSS, which is a joint venture between Banco Bradesco and Banco do Brasil. Bradesco has other digital initiatives as well, and Banco Itau is growing in that space.The president of Itau, Roberto Setubal, said at an event this year that fintech companies \u201crepresent a challenge and an opportunity\u201d for his and the other large banks. Last year, Itau together with Redpoint started Cubo, a co-working space for start-ups in S\u00e3o Paulo.Still, Nubank has momentum. One sign of its appeal is that it has lured multiple prominent foreign investors to make their debut investments in Brazil. The company was Sequoia Capital\u2019s first investment here.Similarly, Founders Fund\u2019s first investment in Brazil was in Nubank one year ago, even though Mr. Thiel had invested in the country through his other investment funds.Advertisement"}

The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v.

The largest companies often cross-license their patents to one another to minimize infringement claims.The Supreme Court battle between Apple and Samsung centered on what happens when the infringement involves just a few features of a product\u2019s design.Apple \u2014 backed by dozens of independent designers as well as fashion-focused companies like Nike and Tiffany \u2014 argued that design is central to many products and that a patent violator should be forced to turn over the full profits it made from infringing designs.Samsung \u2014 whose position was backed by Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, eBay and HP \u2014 argued that any penalties should be proportionate to the importance of the infringing features to the overall product.The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, while not decisively resolving the case, found that liability in design patent cases is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition. But the justices declined to offer more specific guidance. So now Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the smartphone market, will go back to court to wrangle over the appropriate amount of damages for Samsung\u2019s infringement.In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said, \u201cOur case has always been about Samsung\u2019s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\u2019t right.\u201dA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\u201dJustice Sotomayor\u2019s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. \u201cAn \u2018article\u2019 is just \u2018a particular thing,\u2019\u201d she wrote, citing two dictionaries. \u201cAnd \u2018manufacture\u2019 means \u2018the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man\u2019 and \u2018the articles so made.\u2019\u201cAn article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,\u201d she concluded. \u201cSo understood, the term \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.\u201dPatent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\u201cThe court basically punted,\u201d said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. \u201cIt seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to tell you what the right rule is.\u2019\u201dMr. Lemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Backstage at \u2018The Nutcracker\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayUpdated, 8:19 a.m.Good morning on this mixed Wednesday.Harrison Coll is only 22. But on the day I met him, he became six decades older.I joined him backstage at a matinee to see what it\u2019s like between call-time and the moment the curtain rises.He warmed up at a barre at the David H. Koch Theater just before 11 a.m., wearing a one-piece jumper that his mother knitted for him when he first danced as the nutcracker prince at age 12.In the makeup room, where the walls were lined with elaborate hair pieces, Mr. Coll transformed into Drosselmeier as he glued a long, handmade gray wig over his wavy blond hair.\u201cI\u2019m a 22-year-old trying to pretend I\u2019m in my 70s or 80s,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they have me in full makeup and hair, I start developing an accent.\u201dWhile Mr. Coll is also dancing this season as Mother Ginger, a candy cane and the cavalier of the Sugarplum Fairy, Drosselmeier is a particularly unusual assignment because it is typically performed by dancers near the end of their careers, he said.The role was performed early on by Mr. Balanchine himself, a founder of the company, which, Mr. Coll said, \u201cadds a huge amount of weight.\u201dJust before noon, Mr. Coll left the makeup room sporting a dramatic mustache curling out to his dimples. The makeup artist had bushed up Mr. Coll\u2019s eyebrows, etched wrinkles into his forehead and added bags beneath his eyes.He had aged 60 years in 60 minutes.Mr. Coll entered the men\u2019s dressing room, where a sign on the entrance read: \u201cGentlemen: You MUST have your mustache FIRMLY IN PLACE before you will be dressed for the performance. Please plan accordingly.\u201dHe emerged minutes later in costume \u2014 a waistcoat, breeches, tights and a top hat. With the snap of his eye patch and the swoosh of his cloak, he headed toward the stage where he began pacing, pantomiming and repeating his entrance on an endless loop.He was nervous, he told me; this matinee was only his fifth time performing as Drosselmeier, a part he began rehearsing in October.From the side of the stage, I saw the crew lowering a larger-than-life Christmas tree used in an earlier performance during which it had \u201cgrown\u201d toward the ceiling.And then in came the sound of strings.\u201cWhen you hear the orchestra tuning in A,\u201d Mr. Coll said, \u201cthat\u2019s when all the ingredients come together. This is the magic. This is when it starts getting exciting.\u201dHe pursed his lips and hummed to match the tone.It was just before 1 p.m., and a dozen children arrived in costume. Their ballet master, Dena Abergel, was running through corrections from the night before as they swarmed around Mr. Coll\u2019s legs, the girls\u2019 ringlets bouncing beneath their bonnets.In his costume, Mr. Coll looked as though he could be their great-grandfather, but he behaved more like a cool older brother. He practiced lifting the 10-year-old female star, and looked around for the 10-year-old prince.\u201cRight before I come out, I like having my moment with the prince,\u201d said Mr. Coll, who played that role a decade ago. \u201cI\u2019m literally looking into my past. He always asks me how his hair is looking.\u201dAt 1:08, places were called: performers to stage, conductor to pit.The lights went off, the dancers fell silent, and the overture began to crescendo.Here\u2019s what else is happening:If only we could spend all day backstage.Or anywhere that would distract us from the cold. And with central heating, please.A brisk commute is on tap. It will feel like the mid-20s this morning.Winter begins today.To honor the occasion, we share with you some colorful \u2014 even poetic \u2014 coverage of winter solstices past published by The New York Times.(These excerpts make for lovely soliloquies. We suggest reading them aloud and in a dramatic accent.)\u201cIt is the season when ice and snow reign over the northern temperate zone and the sun looks with slanting beams upon a belt of earth where cold and desolation hold sway. He seems to stand still in his course as he views the frigid picture, and then the great giver of physical life and light turns toward us and offers the first precious minute of additional daylight as a guarantee of joys that follow in the train of his progress northward.\u201d\u201cCold will deepen. The wind will sweep down bleak valleys with a freight of snow, and hilltops will be icy knobs against the distant sky. The year will end, and a new year begin, and time will flow like the stream beneath the ice.\u201d\u201cThe solstice is but a calculation, one point on a curving orbit in the cold depths of infinity.\u201d\u201cSince man was first aware of the changing seasons, the winter solstice has been occasion for awe and wonder and a challenge to faith. Hope and belief are easy in a warm, green world, but when the cold days come and the sun edges farther and farther south, cutting a constantly smaller arc across the sky, the imminence of utter darkness and oblivion seems at hand.\u201dNow it\u2019s your turn: How would you describe the winter solstice in prose?

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Completes Final Lap, Electoral College, to White House", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byLiveRepublican electors in Texas vaulted Mr. Trump past the 270 mark, granting him all but two of their 38 ballots in a ceremony in the State Capitol in Austin.In the House chamber, where the electors met, the vote was greeted with a standing ovation by citizens and Republican officials who had come to witness the event. Outside, perhaps 100 protesters waved placards and chanted \u201cSave our democracy\u201d in a vain effort to persuade electors to reject the Republican nominee.Normally a political footnote, the electoral vote acquired an unexpected element of drama this winter after Mr. Trump\u2019s upset of Hillary Clinton, who received 2.86 million more popular votes but won in states that totaled only 232 electoral votes. The states Mr. Trump won held 306 electoral votes.His electoral victory spawned a determined effort to block his path to the presidency by grass-roots advocates who saw him as unfit for the White House and by some who saw him as a threat to the political system.While Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents needed 37 Republican defectors to bring his electoral-vote tally below 270, the bulk of electors who broke ranks \u2014 four in Washington State \u2014 were Democrats who otherwise would have voted for Ms. Clinton. Instead, they voted for the former Republican secretary of state Colin L. Powell and Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American tribal leader who has led opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.Elsewhere, Democratic electors who sought to vote for someone besides Mrs. Clinton switched back to her under pressure or were replaced with Clinton supporters.In Texas, two Republican electors cast protest votes, one each for Ron Paul and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. One other Republican opposed to Mr. Trump resigned and was replaced.A strategy memo by the anti-Trump forces has estimated that as many as 34 Republican electors were prepared to vote for someone besides Mr. Trump, but also said many were afraid of the consequences and suggested that a poor turnout of other anti-Trump electors would weaken their resolve.That appears to have been the case in Texas, where more defections were expected, said Ryan Clayton, the leader of Americans Take Action, a group opposed to Mr. Trump. \u201cWhen they saw the trend line, they just decided to get out of the way of the electoral Alamo that was taking place,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.That left most of the opposition to demonstrators who protested outside and inside electoral voting sites in most if not all 50 states.In Michigan\u2019s capital, Lansing, opposition protesters chanted: \u201cVote your conscience! Follow your heart!\u201d and sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d inside the State Capitol as Republican electors gave all 16 of the states votes to Mr. Trump.In Kentucky\u2019s state Supreme Court chambers, protesters silently watched electors give the state\u2019s eight votes to Mr. Trump as another 50 to 100 demonstrators stood outside.The chants of protest inside the Michigan capitol building never stopped. Not when the state\u2019s 16 electors headed up the stairs to the state Senate chamber to start their meeting. Not when the doors to the chamber were closed. Not even as the proceedings went forward \u2014 all 16 votes going, as expected, to Mr. Trump.\u201cThe president taught an entire generation of elected officials what it means to be to a professional and effective elected official,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, who was the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the Clinton administration in the 1990s. \u201cHe showed that government mattered.\u201d Mr. Cuomo also praised Mrs. Clinton \u2013 a Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009 \u2014 as a role model and \u201ca great friend to this state,\u201d citing her work after 9/11.In brief remarks to reporters after the event, Mr. Clinton said he had \u201cnever cast a vote I was prouder of\u201d than the one for his wife.Protesters gathered outside the state capitol buildings in Atlanta and Nashville before the ballots were cast, and in the House chamber in Nashville, \u201cthere were a few protesters in the gallery, and a couple of times they would try to say something or shout \u2014 but nothing outrageous,\u201d said Adam Ghassemi, the spokesman for the secretary of state.Mr. Sanders was defeated by Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary, but handily won the caucuses in Maine, and the elector, David Bright, wrote that he wanted to send a message to people who cast their first votes for the Democratic Party to support Mr. Sanders.In Harrisburg, hundreds of protesters chanted and waved signs on the steps of the State Capitol and in the lobby, but they were fairly subdued, acknowledging that they did not expect to affect the outcome.A handful of protesters were outside the state capitol in Jackson, and four quietly witnessed the vote in a meeting room inside.Arizona\u2019s 11 electors were not obligated to vote for the winning candidate, which explains why so many protesters gathered on both sides of the State Capitol for a last-ditch \u2014 and long-shot \u2014 push to get them to change their minds.They carried signs that read, \u201cCountry before party\u201d and \u201cElectors: Save us, dump Trump.\u201d They brought their children, their dogs and what was left of their hopes.Karen O\u2019Brien, 54, who voted for Mrs. Clinton, said, \u201cI\u2019m praying that we can get the electors to flip their votes.\u201dIt did not work.Inside, Secretary of State Michele Reagan, a Republican, asked the electors, \u201cAre you ready to tie up this election with a big red bow?\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was married and had a son. According to Russian news agencies, his wife fainted and was hospitalized after being informed of his death.Mr. Matsegora, who said he and Mr. Karlov had started working together in North Korea when they were very young, wrote, \u201cWe agreed that when we retire, which will happen some day, we will take turns visiting each other at our dachas.\u201dBut after the attack, he continued: \u201cWe will not be visiting each other at our dachas. Because he is no more, and half of me, too, is no more.\u201dAn explosion near a courthouse in Izmir was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in Turkey.\u201cIt was stressed that the Russian side\u2019s actions were not a fight against terror, but they bombed civilian Turkmen villages, and this could lead to serious consequences,\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said at the time.Historians said the assassination might have been the first of a Russian ambassador since Pyotr Voykov, a Soviet envoy to Poland, was shot to death in Warsaw in 1927.In the 19th century, Aleksandr Griboyedov, a poet and diplomat, died in Tehran after a mob stormed the Russian Embassy.Tensions between Russia and Turkey had been easing recently, and some analysts said that the assassination might bring the countries closer as they sought to take on terrorism.Televised comments by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after the attack seemed to support that view. He declared that the shooting had been a provocation meant to disrupt the nations\u2019 ties.Mr. Putin added that there was only one possible reaction: Intensifying the \u201ccrackdown on terror.\u201d\u201cTensions first began to rise as the one-time friends were sucked into the regional struggle for Syria \u2014 while Russia backed Assad, Turkey agitated for regime change,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs the alliance unraveled, Moscow broke the silent pact that neither side would support the other\u2019s separatists, and made moves to befriend the Kurds.But by June, economic actions that Russia had taken against Turkey after the jet was shot down were beginning to pay off as an absence of Russian visitors took a toll on Turkey\u2019s tourism industry.Turkey also announced that it would prosecute a man accused of killing the pilot after his plane was shot downed.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Until 1926, Zinder was Niger\u2019s capital. Then it ran low on water.Early one gray-yellow morning, I set off from Zinder for a village called Chana, the home of one of the migrants I had met, Habibou Idi. Rows upon rows of millet grew on both sides of the two-lane national highway, punctuated occasionally by a spindly acacia. About an hour outside the city, some boys were raking the soil, yanking out weeds.Early one gray-yellow morning, I set off from Zinder for a village called Chana, the home of one of the migrants I had met, Habibou Idi.

{"Headline": "Death of a Red Carpet Reporter", "Date": "2016-12-27", "News": "For decades, Jeffrey Slonim was an affable presence on the scene. After he jumped from a roof at Lincoln Center, everyone who knew him had one question: Why?Supported byJeffrey Slonim didn\u2019t shout. While the other red carpet reporters tried to get the attention of celebrities by yelling their names, he usually waited for them to come to him. And they usually did.Although Mr. Slonim specialized in light journalistic fare, he took it seriously. He wrote out his questions in advance and avoided the clich\u00e9d \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d As a result, the quotations he gleaned had some charm.Kim Kardashian West marched straight to his side. Anne Hathaway greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. Gwyneth Paltrow and Melissa McCarthy breezed past the other quote-hungry reporters to speak into the recorder that seemed permanently attached to his hand.\u201cHe was this little island of sanity at every red carpet,\u201d said Andy Cohen, the Bravo talk show host and author. \u201cWhen I read the news, I just thought, \u2018Wow, how sad.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t register,\u201d said Mr. Slonim\u2019s brother, the artist Hunt Slonem (who spells the family name differently). \u201cIt\u2019s like, How? What happened? It\u2019s just so shocking.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnyway, he really made up his mind.\u201dMr. Slonim\u2019s writing for Allure was his main source of income from the mid-1990s until late 2015, when he lost his special correspondent position at the Cond\u00e9 Nast monthly. The change came as part of a cutback that followed the firing of the magazine\u2019s founding editor, Linda Wells. A few months later, Lena Dunham stopped on the red carpet to tell Mr. Slonim she missed his page. He appreciated that. \u201cWhat a doll,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.In the last year of his life, he was trying to piece together a living by turning out celeb-centric items for Gotham, Architectural Digest, Hamptons, the New York Post Page Six column and other outlets.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s what he lived for,\u201d his wife, Fiona Moore, a school administrator, said, \u201cbut he really loved his work.\u201dBut the man who might have struck casual onlookers as just another partygoer would inevitably leave the night\u2019s affair for his desk, where he stayed until his copy was ready to file.\u201cHardest working man in the business,\u201d said George Wayne, a veteran celebrity-and-fashion journalist. \u201cThe thing about Jeff is, unlike some of us \u2014 and I\u2019m one of them \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to be part of the story. He was always the humble ink-stained wretch. He waited at the ropes with everybody else, in the herd. He didn\u2019t mind that. He was so unaffected and so good at his job.\u201dOn a typical day, after working the carpet and filing his items, he would get into bed with his wife at 5 a.m. in their railroad apartment on the Upper East Side and sleep until 7:30. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a great sleeper,\u201d Ms. Moore said. After spending time with his two sons, he would take a nap \u2014 then it was back to the job.To those who saw him only when he was in his element, Mr. Slonim seemed to lead a charmed life, unruffled in a milieu peopled with sometimes-sensitive celebrities and often-rude publicists.He joined the media scrum at Interview magazine in 1984, when Andy Warhol was overseeing it, thanks, in part, to an introduction from his cousin, the writer Tama Janowitz. Mr. Slonim, a Yale graduate, class of 1982, took the job after an unhappy stint at IBM in Florida, where his habit of moonlighting as a cocktail pianist in a hotel bar suggested he was not cut out for corporate life.He spoke French, Italian, Spanish and Swedish. As a young man he banged out short stories on a portable typewriter. Friends fondly recalled him as an expert orchestrator of parties who sometimes entertained guests with his renditions of Scott Joplin rags and Cole Porter standards.In 1993, Ms. Moore moved into his Lexington Avenue apartment, which is still home for her and their two teenage sons. Their 1995 wedding took place in Cork, Ireland, not far from where Ms. Moore grew up. They found a priest who spoke Hebrew to officiate, as if to provide some middle ground for Mr. Slonim, who was Jewish, and the Roman Catholic Moore family. In his toast, the bride\u2019s father mentioned the Warhol line about Mr. Slonim\u2019s smile, adding that you could judge a horse by the quality of its teeth.\u201cPeople were terrified and upset,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cI think Linda being fired was devastating for him.\u201dThe job of celebrity and society reporter, even one at the top of this rarefied field, seemed no longer enough for a family breadwinner. As Mr. Slonim grappled with this, his health issue came to the fore.In June, he stopped taking Interferon. He told his brother that his doctor had taken him off the drug because it was no longer effective for him. Ms. Moore said he started taking a new drug, in the same family as Interferon, but it left him in a low mood.Ray Rogers, an editor who worked with Mr. Slonim at Interview, BlackBook and other publications, was concerned when he saw his friend at an East Hampton benefit over the Labor Day weekend. \u201cI said to him: \u2018Jeff, what\u2019s wrong? Are you O.K.?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cHe looked despondent. He was not himself. And he was like, \u2018I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Jeff, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I must have asked him that in three different ways.\u201dMr. Slonim\u2019s work often took him to Lincoln Center, where the red carpet is rolled out dozens of nights every year.Earlier that day, he called his sister, a psychiatric social worker and professor, Anne Slonim Rafal, and said he was having dark thoughts. After she laid out counseling options for him, he said, as she recalled it, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just being dramatic.\u201dAt home, he told his wife about the call to his sister, and the two of them discussed the possibility of his going on an antidepressant. But Mr. Slonim was against the idea, partly because he did not like the way people looked when they were medicated.They spent the weekend in East Hampton, and things seemed to be looking up. \u201cIt was a lovely time,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cHurricane Matthew was coming in, and we went to the beach and all of that. He kept saying, \u2018I feel so much better,\u2019 so of course I believed him.\u201dAfter the Hamptons idyll, Mr. Slonim went to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center to see his hematologist. He apparently spoke of his recent thoughts, and the hospital placed him under observation.His wife said he called from the hospital, saying he wanted to leave. Mr. Slonim also called his sister, Dr. Slonim Rafal, who advised him to be honest with staff members and to follow their recommendations. \u201cThey never admitted him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just observed him for, I would say, 36 hours, maybe 48.\u201d\u201cHe wanted out of there, big time,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cHe compared it to like the seven rings of hell, basically.\u201d(A public affairs officer at the hospital said that \u201cregarding Jeffrey Slonim,\u201d she had \u201cno information available.\u201d)Mr. Slonim was released and made his way home on the evening of Oct. 11, his wife said, and he seemed in good spirits. The next morning, they went for a run together, and he said, as she recalled it: \u201cI can see color for the first time. This is amazing.\u201d He was also making plans \u2014 lunches for the following week and a meeting at the Cond\u00e9 Nast human resources department.\u201cHe felt he needed to reinvent himself, that print was dying,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cSo he was working on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201dOn the morning of Oct. 13, he went to Lincoln Center. The Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Lawn was closed, but he slipped past a chain gate and made his way to its northern edge, above the West 65th Street sidewalk.At 10:52 a.m., someone called 911. Documents from the New York Police Department note \u201ca 56-year-old male who\u2019s observed pacing back-and-forth on a roof and sitting on a ledge.\u201dA crowd formed outside the entrances to the restaurant and the nearby Elinor Bunin Film Center. Two Lincoln Center security guards were talking to Mr. Slonim, and it seemed to be working. At one point, he turned around and moved away from the ledge \u2014 only to come back. People screamed \u201cNo!\u201d when he made his move and hit the sidewalk below.\u201cAt 11:05 a.m., the unit was on scene,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Fire Department of New York said in an email. \u201cThe unit departed the scene at 11:13 a.m. with one patient to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\u201dDespite the doctors\u2019 efforts, Mr. Slonim died later that day, his wife said.\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who spent his whole career covering high society \u2014 and to take his life, he walked over to Lincoln Center and jumped,\u201d his friend Mr. Rogers said. \u201cIt seemed intentional to me. It seemed pointed.\u201dBack in the apartment, Ms. Moore found a note on the computer. \u201cHe\u2019s rambling and stuff,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he thanks a couple of people, and he thanks Linda Wells. It\u2019s really sweet.\u201dSpeakers included his two sisters, who recalled the Superman costume he wore as a boy; his brother-in-law, Dominic Moore, who described his generosity with the swag bags he picked up at parties; the Oscar-winning film producer Bruce Cohen, who reminisced about his days with Mr. Slonim in middle school, at Yale and on the red carpet; and the former Allure editor Ms. Wells, who spoke last.\u201cJeffrey hit the red carpet and he loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich sounds hard to believe, now that the red carpet is so often a shouting match and a total fame orgy. But he did, and he respected it, too.\u201dAfter describing his amusing encounters with Roseanne Barr, George Clooney and Donald J. Trump, she continued: \u201cYou could tell he had a genuine connection with the subjects, many of whom made a ritual out of greeting him with a kiss. He gave as much time and attention to the Oscar winner as he did to the guy who was voted off \u2018Survivor: Borneo.\u2019\u201dA montage of still photographs projected onto a small movie screen gave glimpses of Mr. Slonim from babyhood to adulthood. After the clergyman said a few final words, the mourners stayed in place for a long moment, silent and not quite ready to leave.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Presses American Tech Companies to Tackle Hate Speech", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byEuropean officials pushed on Tuesday for American technology giants to do more to tackle online hate speech across the region, adding to the chorus of policy makers worldwide demanding greater action from the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter.Amid growing security tensions in much of the Western world, governments, intelligence agencies and advocacy groups want Google, Microsoft and other technology companies to take further steps to curb hate speech on digital platforms, as well as to clamp down on how terrorists circulate information online.But freedom of expression campaigners have warned that such demands may limit people\u2019s ability to communicate across the internet, and they have cautioned that the line between hate speech and legitimate political discussion can be blurry.Press officers for Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for Facebook and Twitter were not immediately available to comment.In a recent interview, Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said that the social network was committed to tackling hate speech online, but that there was a fine line between what was legitimate under freedom of speech laws and what was required to protect people online.\u201cOur policies provide protection from hate speech,\u201d Mr. Allan said last month. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t apply media regulation to the speech of ordinary citizens.\u201dSome lawmakers, though, are not satisfied.Heiko Maas, the German justice minister, has said that Facebook could even be held criminally liable for illegal hate speech posts, and he has called for legislation if the company does not meet its legal commitments.\u201cFacebook has a certain responsibility to uphold the laws,\u201d Mr. Maas said.The social network denies any wrongdoing.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe.

{"Headline": "3 Months After Explosion, SpaceX Plans to Launch Rocket Bearing Satellites", "Date": "2016-12-01", "News": "Supported byThree months after one of its rockets exploded on a launchpad, SpaceX hopes to resume launching in a couple of weeks.Iridium Communications, which provides communications services through a constellation of more than 60 satellites, announced Thursday that it was aiming to launch the first batch of its next-generation satellites on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Dec. 16.The launch hinges on approval by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is reviewing SpaceX\u2019s investigation of the Sept. 1 launchpad explosion. A Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Fla., caught fire and exploded during fueling before a test firing of its engines. The explosion destroyed a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to use to expand internet services in Africa and elsewhere.But Matthew J. Desch, chief executive of Iridium, said his company had taken part in the SpaceX investigation, adding that he had read a preliminary explanation for the accident. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t approve our satellites to be launched if I wasn\u2019t confident,\u201d Mr. Desch said in an interview.\u201cWe are looking forward to return to flight with the first Iridium NEXT launch,\u201d Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement, referring to Iridium\u2019s satellite constellation.The F.A.A. said that the investigation was still underway and that it had not yet approved the launch.SpaceX officials did not provide any new technical details of what went wrong in September.The explosion damaged SpaceX\u2019s launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 Iridium satellites will instead lift off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the site of a second SpaceX launchpad.Iridium provides communication services including satellite telephones through its network of satellites circling the Earth at an altitude of 485 miles. The original satellites launched two decades ago at a cost of $5 billion, but Iridium flopped, declaring bankruptcy in 1999. The company finally found its financial footing.Sixty-five of the original satellites are still in orbit, and Iridium is planning to replace all of them in the next year and a half, with seven Falcon 9 launches carrying 70 satellites, each roughly the size of a Mini Cooper. The new satellites are bigger and more powerful, able to send data at faster rates. Iridium is also planning new services like the tracking of planes and ships in real time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Officials Accuse Facebook of Misleading Them on WhatsApp Deal", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byThe accusation, which could lead to a fine of up to 1 percent of Facebook\u2019s yearly revenue, meaning a penalty of about $200 million, comes amid growing tension with Europe\u2019s policy makers over how the company is able to dominate much of the region\u2019s digital world.The company denies all of the allegations, but says it is doing more to remove fake news articles and posts that promote hate speech.On Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, said Facebook had misled regulators in 2014 when it bought WhatsApp. She said the company did not outline its plans to match people\u2019s Facebook accounts with those on the popular messaging app, which now has more than a billion users worldwide.Yet Ms. Vestager said the potential of such linking was not explained when the social network sought regulatory approval for the purchase, despite questioning from European officials.By subsequently adding the data sharing to its wider digital offerings, she said, Facebook misled officials, since the company already had the ability to match people\u2019s accounts when the takeover was first announced.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Facebook said that it had acted in good faith when seeking approval of the deal from European regulators, and that the company had contacted the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, at the start of this year about its new plans to match people\u2019s accounts.\u201cWe respect the commission\u2019s process,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman, Sally Aldous, said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate and share information officials need to resolve their questions.\u201dFacebook has until the end of next month to respond to the European competition charges and there is no fixed deadline for the authorities in Brussels to make a decision in the case. Any legal appeal against the potential ruling could take years to resolve.Twelve years ago, the commission raised the maximum allowable fine to the current level of 1 percent of annual revenue to dissuade companies from misleading regulators during mergers.Despite having brought similar cases against other companies, the commission has never imposed the potentially higher fines. The previous record in such a case dates to 1999, when the commission fined the German postal operator Deutsche Post 100,000 euros, or about $105,000 at current exchange rates, for two offenses. At the time, the maximum fine for each offense was \u20ac50,000.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Despite the new regulatory standoff, Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp is not in question. Any European decision against Facebook would not restrict the increasing dominance that the social network and WhatsApp have over how people in the Western world communicate.Facebook\u2019s plans to link WhatsApp to its increasingly powerful online advertising business model have come under increasing scrutiny in Europe, which has some of the toughest privacy and competition rules.The company still shares people\u2019s digital information in the United States and elsewhere, although privacy campaigners have filed legal challenges with the Federal Trade Commission.European policy makers say that they are protecting the region\u2019s 500 million people from potential harmful acts by these dominant American companies, though industry executives have often accused the region\u2019s lawmakers of unfairly targeting Silicon Valley giants to promote European rivals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just How Much Do the Top Private Equity Earners Make?", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Supported byBottom Line NationThere is C.E.O. pay. Then there is private equity C.E.O. pay.When large corporations disclose how much money their top executives make each year, the companies list salary, bonus and, in many cases, stock options or grants. It can add up to tens of millions of dollars.Top executives at the publicly traded private equity firms get all that, and a whole lot more. They often pocket money from a variety of additional sources that can total hundreds of millions of dollars a year.The joint study captured the full picture of what the executives made based on their affiliation with their firms, including dividends on the stock they own and some extra benefits specific to private equity. (A full breakdown is below.) Many of the earnings are is not traditional compensation, but it\u2019s money in their pockets nonetheless.In the last two years, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive and a co-founder of the Blackstone Group, received the largest sum. In 2015, he collected just under $800 million, up from $689 million the year before. Of that amount, only $350,000 was his annual salary. He received no bonus.But you don\u2019t need to be Mr. Schwarzman to earn huge sums at Blackstone, arguably the industry\u2019s most successful firm. Hamilton E. James, Blackstone\u2019s president, received $233 million in 2015, while Blackstone\u2019s real estate chief, Jonathan D. Gray, earned $249 million.Other prominent firms have produced big payouts as well. In 2013, the biggest winner was Leon Black, the head of Apollo Global Management, who received about $543 million. In 2015, Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, the co-heads of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, collected a combined $356 million.To put these huge numbers in perspective, The Times also asked Equilar to pull data on the annual payouts to chief executives of the nation\u2019s largest banks and technology companies.Using the same method it used for private equity, Equilar collected data from the nation\u2019s largest banks and the technology giants. As a final undertaking, Equilar scanned its broader database of companies to search for the largest executive payouts from 2015.The conclusion of the study was striking: Private equity has the best-paid executives of any major American industry.The Times based that conclusion on a number of findings. For one thing, of the top 15 executive payouts from 2015, 10 were in private equity. In private equity alone, there were eight executives who reaped more than $100 million. From every other industry tracked by Equilar, there were only five executives who reached such heights.For all the populist outrage that banks have faced over compensation, their executives make just a fraction of what private equity chiefs do. Median pay among the top-ranking private equity executives in the joint study was $138 million in 2015; for bankers, that number was $23 million. And not all of the bank compensation is guaranteed.Private equity firms note that, unlike banks, many of the top executives actually founded their firms. This is why The Times also asked Equilar to collect data from tech firms, since they, too, often have founders at the helm.Indeed, Lawrence J. Ellison, the co-founder, executive chairman and former chief executive of Oracle, collected the second largest payout in the joint study. He received $631 million last year, much of it in dividends on his stock, second only to Mr. Schwarzman, who also made much of his money from dividends.And yet, over all, the payouts to tech executives are still far short of those in private equity.Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook was paid a salary of $1 last year and received personal security and aircraft perks valued at around $5 million.Of course, because Facebook\u2019s stock price is significantly higher than Blackstone\u2019s or Apollo\u2019s, Mr. Zuckerberg is worth more, at roughly $49 billion, than Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Black (who are both billionaires) combined. (Stock sales and unrealized equity gains from increase in stock price weren\u2019t included in this study.) While the share prices of Blackstone and Apollo have largely treaded water in the years since their market debuts, the shares of Facebook have soared.In addition to conventional salary and executive compensation, private equity chieftains make their money in three ways:First, private equity firms typically issue dividend-paying shares to their investors. And since the executives are often huge holders of the stock, they collect dividends, or distributions on their partnership shares, on a quarterly basis.The private equity firms argue that their executives could retire to a beach and earn these same dividends. Of course, very few do. Most private equity executives sell their shares upon leaving their firms. And at some shops, executives collect a higher dividend than is awarded to ordinary shareholders.Second, the executives invest in their firms\u2019 own funds and get to keep their profits. The firms require executives to commit at least some personal money to these funds; it\u2019s what\u2019s known in the industry as \u201ceating our own cooking.\u201d The Times included these numbers because these executives often choose to invest huge sums on top of what\u2019s required, and doing so is a perk not available to ordinary investors.Finally, there is what\u2019s known as carried interest, essentially the profits earned on each of the firm\u2019s deals. The top executives of private equity firms often earn a cut of these profits. An executive can either take a direct cut of the so-called carry pool or earn those quarterly dividends or distributions that are largely composed of carried interest. The more carried interest earned, the higher the dividend.It is worth noting some limitations of the data. First, given that Equilar pulled data from the last few years, the study is intended as a snapshot, not a definitive accounting of net worth. Still, the methodology treated each executive consistently and calculated the entirety of the payouts.Furthermore, The Times and Equilar focused on publicly traded companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. Privately-held corporations need not report compensation information. And so, while private equity earned the biggest payouts among the largest publicly traded industries, there could be private companies (or small public ones) doling out even bigger paydays.Some hedge fund executives, for example, routinely take home $1 billion or more annually, according to some published estimates, but these firms are not publicly traded.Similarly, of the thousands of private equity firms that exist, only a half dozen or so are publicly traded. As such, a private equity executive not captured within this data may make even more.Even the publicly traded private equity firms do not disclose all the same information, particularly when it comes to profits on their own funds. The publicly traded Carlyle Group, for example, no longer discloses this information. Ares Management, however, includes both the amount of personal capital invested and the profits made on those investments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Safe Choice in Stuyvesant Town", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byThe HuntAfter three years in London, Kristin Petuck Luks and Howard Luks readied themselves to return to New York.They planned to attend a friend\u2019s wedding earlier this fall. So they flew in for four days, appending an apartment hunt to their wedding trip.In London, where Mr. Luks was sent for his job in business development for a software company, they rented in Marylebone, which reminded them of the West Village. Their small one-bedroom had a lofted sleeping area, low water pressure, limited hot water and scant closet space.\u201cWe paid for the quaint neighborhood and centrality with the tiniest apartment we have ever lived in,\u201d Mrs. Luks said.She craved a second bedroom to use as her home office, where she could spread out her drawings and samples of stone, wood and tile. Ideally, she wanted a charming neighborhood. The budget was $3,500 to $4,200 a month.With Mr. Luks soon expected in his New York office, the Lukses needed to find a place within days. \u201cTime was not on our side,\u201d Mr. Luks said.He had an uncle who owned some residential buildings. One two-bedroom in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, was available. The third-floor walk-up, in a converted church building, rented for $3,500.\u201cI\u2019ve reached the point in life where I don\u2019t want to walk up that many steps,\u201d said Mr. Luks, 43. The aboveground tracks of the F and G trains, which ran noisily nearby, concerned Mrs. Luks, 35.On Facebook, Mr. Luks\u2019s sister saw an intriguing listing in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, from a friend, Chad Kessler, a salesman at New Millennium Real Estate. So Mr. Kessler took the Lukses to see it. The $4,000 apartment was beautifully renovated, but the second bedroom was more like an extension of the master bedroom with an extra-wide doorway. The departing family\u2019s two young children slept in the extension.\u201cThe bedroom is like an opulent huge parlor, and Kristin wanted an actual office with a door you could close,\u201d Mr. Kessler said.And if relatives stayed overnight, everyone would effectively be sleeping in the same room.\u201cMy wife is very concerned with layout and gets frustrated with wasted space,\u201d Mr. Luks said. \u201cI am more concerned with amenities, like does it have a dishwasher.\u201dMr. Kessler had another building to show, nearby in Boerum Hill. The just-redone two-unit building had two two-bedroom vacancies. One, at $3,750, was too small for their needs. The other had a lovely private roof deck but, at $4,750, was too pricey.What\u2019s more, construction was still wrapping up. \u201cMy wife has enough experience to know that nothing is ever done on time,\u201d Mr. Luks said. They couldn\u2019t wait.The two were staying at a friend\u2019s place just a few blocks from Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan. Mr. Luks used to live nearby. The location was a 15-minute walk to his office near the Flatiron district. Stuyvesant Town carried no broker fee. It was a solid default option.\u201cIt is hard when you are under time pressure and moving from a different continent,\u201d Mr. Luks said.The couple arranged for an appointment the next day, viewing a few two-bedrooms. They took the first one they saw, with plenty of closet space and strong water pressure. The apartment was on a low floor and the day was cloudy, but they knew they could brighten the dark floors with rugs.They canceled the next day\u2019s appointments in Brooklyn Heights, renting their apartment for $4,200 a month. The rent includes gas and electricity; the charge for air-conditioning is $26.65 per window unit per month.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to run around anymore,\u201d Mrs. Luks said. \u201cStuyvesant Town was a known entity. There were no wild cards popping up. The floor plan is really functional, and I am a tough critic.\u201dNow, though First Avenue is hardly the charming street she had envisioned, the neighborhood is certainly practical. The two enjoy Stuyvesant Town\u2019s community feel, with welcoming neighbors who chat in the elevators and laundry room.\u201cEverybody seems to know each other,\u201d Mr. Luks said. \u201cThere are plenty of older folks who still live here. I have a friend who lives here with her husband and two children, and they are in the building that her grandparents have lived in since her mother was born.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worried About the Privacy of Your Messages? Download Signal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byTech FixBY the time you finish reading this column, you would be foolish not to download the messaging app Signal onto your smartphone and computer.The free encrypted messaging service has won the acclaim of security researchers and privacy advocates, including Edward J. Snowden. All have said that Signal goes above and beyond other chat tools in keeping electronic communications private.Signal is one of many encrypted messaging services, but it stands out for its uncompromising security and ease of use. The chat service retains virtually no information from users, including messages and address books, on its servers. What\u2019s more, messages remain encrypted when passing through Signal\u2019s servers, meaning that the app\u2019s creators can\u2019t read them.Some people have already cottoned on to this. Signal experienced a 400 percent jump in daily downloads since Mr. Trump won the election, according to Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Open Whisper Systems, the nonprofit that developed Signal. To Mr. Marlinspike, the surge in downloads reflects anxiety among Americans about the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency for personal privacy.\u201cTrump has threatened a lot of people and he\u2019s about to be in control of the most pervasive and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cA lot of people are justifiably concerned about that.\u201dSignal offers end-to-end encryption, meaning a message is scrambled so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient when it is sent from your device, and it remains so when it passes through the app\u2019s server and reaches the recipient.When you initiate a conversation with someone on Signal, you and the recipient exchange so-called cryptographic keys. Only the person who receives your message holds the key to decrypt and read it. That means that if a government agency had a wiretapping order for your Signal messages, Open Whisper Systems would not have the key to decipher the messages and would be unable to comply.Signal\u2019s technology sets the standard for other messaging services, with its protocol being an open-source system that other companies can freely use. WhatsApp, Facebook\u2019s Messenger and Google embedded Signal\u2019s encrypted messaging system into their own apps this year.Even so, security researchers said they preferred Signal over other messaging apps because it was more thorough in protecting users\u2019 privacy. The only information Signal stores about users in its database is the last time someone connected to its server and when a person signed up for Signal. Other messaging apps maintain pieces of personal data on their servers.Even though Signal doesn\u2019t record your information, the app still works across devices, like a desktop computer and a mobile device. Messages and contacts\u2019 data are stored directly on users\u2019 devices and synchronized between them.Let\u2019s say you already use Signal on your iPhone and want to use it to chat on a Mac (Signal is available as a web app for Google\u2019s Chrome browser for desktop computers). To link the desktop app with your iPhone, you would use the iPhone\u2019s camera to scan a bar code on the Mac web app, which links the two devices together. Then, to get your contacts list and conversations to appear on the Mac, the Mac app pulls your contacts list and messages directly from the iPhone via an encrypted channel, according to Mr. Marlinspike.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more work, from our perspective,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than storing all this stuff on a server.\u201dSignal occasionally runs into glitches, such as when it comes to synchronizing data between computers and smartphones. In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app \u2014 though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later.Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service.Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time; I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad. Mr. Marlinspike said it would support multiple mobile devices eventually.Still, this is a trivial issue. I\u2019d choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day.Another benefit is that Open Whisper Systems is a nonprofit that relies on donations and grants, not a business that might eventually have an incentive to share your information with third parties like advertisers.That\u2019s not to say Signal should be your only messaging app. You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters, like work-related conversations. Then for casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones, you could switch to more \u201cfun\u201d apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want.Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends. The app isn\u2019t as popular among consumers as other mainstream messaging apps, so hanging out on Signal can feel lonely. So if you care about your privacy, other than installing Signal today, you should nag everyone you know to join the service, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Rain of Shells, Aleppo\u2019s Civilians Offer \u2018Final Scream\u2019", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Families, medical workers, insurgent fighters and wounded people were packed and ready Wednesday morning to vacate the ravaged rebel-held neighborhoods of the Syrian city of Aleppo under a deal between Russia and Turkey. Then the resumed booms of incoming artillery shells from pro-government forces sent them into hiding or running for their lives.It was the latest life-or-death whiplash for the thousands trapped in the ruins of a once-vibrant northern metropolis, which has come to symbolize the atrocities unfolding in the nearly six-year-old war.That outcome would leave the whole city in the hands of forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Messages posted to a WhatsApp group by an English teacher in Aleppo describe what he saw in the shrinking rebel-held territory, as Syrian forces and their allies waged an assault to retake the city.The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, denounced the resumed shelling, calling it a probable war crime.\u201cThe way this deal was dangled in front of this battered and beleaguered population \u2014 causing them to hope they might indeed live to see another day \u2014 and then snatched away just half a day later is also outrageously cruel,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said in a statement.\u201cThe Syrian government has a clear responsibility to ensure its people are safe, and is palpably failing to take this opportunity to do so,\u201d he said.As each side blamed the other for the deal\u2019s collapse, civilians inside the city issued anguished, angry pleas for international pressure to reinstate it. The Assad government and Iran, Syria\u2019s other main ally besides Russia, appeared not to have been fully consulted on the deal, according to international officials and others briefed on the talks, and were insisting on new conditions.Rebel groups outside the city resumed shelling government-held districts in Aleppo. Civilians in other rebel-held areas to the north protested against their leaders and ransacked posts of hard-line rebel groups, demanding they help those in Aleppo.Close to midnight Wednesday, rebel groups announced a new deal for another evacuation attempt on Thursday. Trapped civilians expressed disbelief, and the Syrian military denied that another deal had been reached.But by early Thursday the shelling had tapered off, residents reported, hoping the pause would hold.As the shelling escalated Wednesday morning, a radiology nurse in Aleppo, Mohamed al-Ahmad, said he hoped the world would hear \u201cour final scream,\u201d adding that the wounded, with rescue and medical services in disarray, were bleeding to death in the streets.Yasser, an accountant volunteering in a makeshift medical clinic, posted a photograph via WhatsApp of an injured girl lying on a hallway floor. She was 10, he said, with broken bones, and was crying and shouting: \u201cGet me out of Aleppo. I am afraid, I am cold. My back is hurting me. Where is the doctor?\u201dYasser, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of being arrested for contacting journalists, said in frustration, \u201cLet us leave \u2014 what is happening?\u201dProblems with the deal had been evident from the start. Soon after it was announced Tuesday night, Syrian officials said they had no knowledge of it, and there was no word from Iran.Then, around 1 a.m. Wednesday, a convoy of vans carrying dozens of wounded people, including fighters and their families, began making its way out of Aleppo.But the vans returned soon after, witnesses said, after Iranian-backed militiamen blocked the way and said they did not have Syrian government permission.The militiamen said they would not allow anyone out until rebel groups had ended their siege of Fouaa and Kfarya, two encircled Shiite enclaves in Idlib Province. Residents said they were told they could leave at 6 a.m., but as buses idled, the shelling resumed.Opposition leaders and civilians inside Aleppo said they believed that Iran had balked at a deal brokered by Russia. Osama Abu Zayd, a legal adviser to Syrian opposition factions, told The Associated Press that Iran\u2019s field commander in Syria was resisting it.The interests of Mr. Assad\u2019s two main backers, Russia and Iran, do not always dovetail. Iran has a stake in retaining the influence it gained by entering the conflict on behalf of Mr. Assad two years before Russia.Iran has trained, backed and financed the pro-government militias that have bolstered Syrian ground forces, with recruits from Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries, as well as Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group.Yasser, the accountant, said civilians in Aleppo did not approve of rebel shelling of civilians in Fouaa and Kfarya. \u201cWe are humans,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not our enemies. They are civilians like us.\u201dThe Russian Defense Ministry blamed the rebels for the impasse, saying on Wednesday that they had \u201cresumed the hostilities\u201d at dawn, trying to break through Syrian government positions to the northwest. Residents questioned why rebels inside eastern Aleppo would start shooting again when they were about to escape.Later, negotiators said the Syrian government was asking for the release of prisoners and the bodies of dead soldiers, and for rebels to hand over fighters from the Qaeda-linked Levant Conquest Front.Our reporter\u2019s photographs and cellphone videos from a road trip in one of the world\u2019s most violent war zones.Government opponents also said they suspected Mr. Assad of stalling. His government has often skillfully played its backers against one another. The wrangling could provide cover to finish off Aleppo\u2019s last rebel enclave with force. As one Syrian military officer told Reuters in Aleppo recently, rebels must \u201csurrender or die.\u201dTroubles carrying out the accord were not surprising, as there was no international monitoring \u2014 United Nations officials said the Syrian government had refused their repeated pleas to observe \u2014 and no enforcement provision. The same problems have vexed other deals reached during the conflict.Malek, an activist who said he hoped to join his pregnant wife in northern Aleppo Province, and who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retaliation, said the world saw civilians in rebel-held territory as \u201cno longer human.\u201d\u201cThey think we are Daesh,\u201d he said via WhatsApp, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, the militant group that has established a so-called caliphate in parts of Syria but not in Aleppo.Using a mournful expression, he added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t taste the flavor of life.\u201dAt the United Nations on Tuesday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there had been \u201ccredible reports\u201d of atrocities, including extrajudicial killings, as eastern Aleppo was retaken.Russia categorically denied the reports, and Mr. Ban said the world body had been unable to verify them.Dr. Salem Abou Al-Nasr, a dentist who had kept his clinic open until last week but finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods when his was taken by government forces, said Wednesday morning that he could hear heavy shelling.\u201cWe slept a quiet night, but sadly the shelling is back,\u201d he said.\u201cThe situation can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone should know, we, the people here, we love life and want to live.\u201dThe evacuation plan came after two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian Army and its allies, who drove insurgents into an ever-smaller pocket of eastern Aleppo, with support from heavy airstrikes and artillery fire.Rebel groups have received support from Turkey, the United States and Persian Gulf states, but far less than the direct military aid that Iran and Russia have provided to Mr. Assad.Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow, Somini Sengupta from the United Nations, and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

A small detail: Tidal flooding is becoming so common that towns are posting \u201cNo Wake\u201d signs on the streets, where vehicles driving a little too fast through a foot or two of seawater can send damaging waves crashing against nearby property.How do you talk about climate change during a presidential administration that denies it\u2019s happening?Most people who think that climate change is really happening also acknowledge that humans have caused it. But getting people to actually do something about it may be the next phase in the battle to prevent catastrophic warming.Over the course of the last year, I\u2019ve spoken with people in different communities around the world who are trying to do what they can to make a difference, even if they can\u2019t see the effects.They have tried to connect the global problem of climate change to normal life, because it\u2019s not always about the melting polar ice caps or apocalyptic drought. Yes, climate change is about those things, but it is also about the ways that life in the 21st century makes most people, especially those in the developed world, part of the problem.It\u2019s a fad among some diesel truck owners who soup up their engines and remove their emissions controls to belch black smoke at pedestrians, cyclists and even unsuspecting Prius drivers.And depending on whom you ask, the fad is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism or a brazen show of American freedom.

I will continue to roll coal anytime I feel like and fog your stupid eco-cars,\u201d one angry Illinois voter wrote to a local state representative who has proposed a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters emissions equipment.At its core, rolling coal seems to me to be a symptom of a backlash against the notion that we should seek to minimize the human footprint on earth, for the sake of the environment.Producing roughly 45 percent of the emissions that cause climate change, coal is a dirty fuel source. Yet the world still relies on it for power. The Kemper project was supposed to provide a model for a new version of carbon-capture technology that could be replicated around the world.But the Kemper power plant is more than two years past deadline and more than $4 billion over budget. The plant\u2019s owner faces credit downgrades, multiple lawsuits and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Parts of California were relatively wet last winter, leading to a much larger snowpack in the Sierra Nevada than the year before, along with rising optimism that the state might eventually see an end to severe drought conditions that have lingered for four years.It is not easy to find out what\u2019s happening in the Arctic Ocean. If you have a few months to spare, you can board an icebreaker and chug across a small section of the sea, taking measurements. Alternatively, you can pore through the images of the North Pole that have been captured by satellites over the past few decades.___Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Mounts Effort to Limit Tide of Fake News", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported byFor weeks, Facebook has been questioned about its role in spreading fake news. Now the company has mounted its most concerted effort to combat the problem.Facebook, the social network, is in a tricky position with these tests. It has long regarded itself as a neutral place where people can freely post, read and view content, and it has said it does not want to be an arbiter of truth. But as its reach and influence have grown, it has had to confront questions about its moral obligations and ethical standards regarding what appears on the network.Its experiments on curtailing fake news show that Facebook recognizes it has a deepening responsibility for what is on its site. But Facebook also must tread cautiously in making changes, because it is wary of exposing itself to claims of censorship.\u201cWe really value giving people a voice, but we also believe we need to take responsibility for the spread of fake news on our platform,\u201d said Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who is in charge of its news feed, the company\u2019s method of distributing information to its global audience.He said the changes \u2014 which, if successful, may be available to a wide audience \u2014 resulted from many months of internal discussion about how to handle false news articles shared on the network.Still, Facebook has taken the most heat over fake news. The company has been under that spotlight since Nov. 8, when Donald J. Trump was elected the 45th president. Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory almost immediately led people to focus on whether Facebook had influenced the electorate, especially with the rise of hyperpartisan sites on the network and many examples of misinformation, such as a false article that claimed Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump for president that was shared nearly a million times across the site.In an interview, Mr. Mosseri said Facebook did not think its news feed had directly caused people to vote for a particular candidate, given that \u201cthe magnitude of fake news across Facebook is one fraction of a percent of the content across the network.\u201dThis time, Facebook is making it easier to flag content that may be fake. Users can report a post they dislike in their feed, but when Facebook asks for a reason, the site presents them with a list of limited and vague options, including the cryptic \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be on Facebook.\u201d In Facebook\u2019s new experiment, users will have a choice to flag the post as fake news and have the option to message the friend who originally shared the piece to tell him or her the article is false.If an article receives enough flags as fake, it can be directed to a coalition of groups that will fact-check it. The groups include Snopes, PolitiFact, The Associated Press, FactCheck.org and ABC News. They will check the article and can mark it as a \u201cdisputed\u201d piece, a designation that will be seen on Facebook.Partner organizations will not be paid, the companies said. Some characterized the fact-checking as an extension of their journalistic efforts.\u201cWe actually regard this as a big part of our core mission,\u201d James Goldston, the president of ABC News, said in an interview. \u201cIf that core mission isn\u2019t helping people regard the real from the fake news, I don\u2019t know what our mission is.\u201dDisputed articles will ultimately appear lower in the news feed. If users still decide to share such an article, they will receive a pop-up reminding them that the accuracy of the piece is in question.Facebook said it was casting a wide net to add more partners to its fact-checking coalition and may move outside of the United States with the initiative if early experiments go well. The company is also part of the First Draft Coalition, an effort with other technology and media companies including Twitter, Google, The New York Times and CNN, to combat the spread of fake news online.In another change in how the news feed works, articles that many users read but do not share will be ranked lower on people\u2019s feeds. Mr. Mosseri said a low ratio of sharing an article after it has been read could be perceived as a negative signal, one that might reflect that the article was misleading or of poor quality.\u201cFacebook was inevitably going to have to curate the platform much more carefully, and this seems like a reasonably transparent method of intervention,\u201d said Emily Bell, director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.\u201cBut the fake cat is already out of the imaginary bag,\u201d Ms. Bell added. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t try and do something about it, next time around it could have far worse consequences.\u201dFacebook also plans to impede the economics of spreading fake articles across the network. Fake news purveyors generally make money when people click on the false articles and are directed to third-party websites, the majority of which are filled with dozens of low-cost ads.Facebook will review those third-party links and check for things like whether the page is mostly filled with advertising content \u2014 a dead giveaway for spam sites \u2014 or to see whether a link masquerades as a different site, like a fake version of The New York Times. Such sites would not be eligible to display Facebook advertising on their pages.Articles disputed by the fact-checking coalition will also not be eligible to be inserted into Facebook ads, a tactic viral spammers have used to spread fake news quickly and gain more clicks on their websites.Facebook said that in these early experiments it would deal with only fake news content; it does not plan to flag opinion posts or other content that could not be easily classified. The changes will not affect satirical sites like The Onion, which often jabs at political subjects through tongue-in-cheek humor.Executives at Facebook stressed the overriding factor right now is not just engagement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Lines Up Establishment Republicans to Vouch for Rex Tillerson", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After waging an 18-month assault on the Republican establishment, President-elect Donald J. Trump changed course on Tuesday and enlisted the party\u2019s high priests of foreign policy to help him win the confirmation of Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state.Several former Republican secretaries of defense and state sought to dismiss bipartisan concerns about Mr. Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil chief executive, over his two-decade relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At the center of the debate are questions about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s vocal opposition to American sanctions imposed on Russia as he pursued oil and gas deals in that country.Their mobilization showed how much Mr. Tillerson\u2019s nomination is already a Congressional proxy fight over Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Russia and Mr. Putin. Democrats issued blunt denunciations of the idea that a globe-trotting energy executive could adequately represent the national interests of the United States. So did several leading Republicans, whose party orthodoxy has been anti-Kremlin for decades.Democrats and liberal activists also expressed deep concern about the fate of human rights and climate change under a State Department led by Mr. Tillerson, a 40-year veteran of the country\u2019s largest oil company. At the other end of the political spectrum, social conservatives condemned him for playing a role in reversing the Boy Scouts\u2019 longstanding policy of excluding gay people, an issue that became a cultural flashpoint for the religious right.And when he faces lawmakers during hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Tillerson will almost certainly be grilled about his finances, his tax returns and his personal investments \u2014 questions that Mr. Trump managed to largely avoid answering about himself during his presidential campaign.\u201cRex Tillerson\u2019s philosophy on international religious freedom, Middle East instability, foreign assistance and relations with countries like Russia and China must be closely examined before confirmation,\u201d Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said on Tuesday in a statement on Facebook.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.A series of statements followed from former Vice President Dick Cheney and former secretaries of state James A. Baker III and Condoleezza Rice, among others. In an interview, Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense under President Obama and President George W. Bush, strongly endorsed Mr. Tillerson, a longtime friend, calling him someone who \u201cknows the world like the back of his hand.\u201dMr. Gates, whose consulting firm has represented Exxon Mobil, said that senators concerned about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Mr. Putin are basing their criticism \u201con a superficial watching\u201d of video clips of the Exxon executive receiving the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013 with Mr. Putin.Mr. Gates said he recommended Mr. Tillerson to the president-elect because he is someone with decades of experience negotiating with foreign leaders.\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to confuse having a friendly relationship based on business with sympathy or friendship,\u201d said Mr. Gates, who acknowledged in an earlier statement that Exxon has been a client. \u201cI think Rex is a hard-eyed realist, and I think he will absolutely put America\u2019s interests first in any negotiation.\u201dDuring the 2016 primary campaign, Mr. Trump often railed against a Republican establishment that he accused of trying to prevent him from becoming president. On Tuesday, his transition staff proudly released statements of support for Mr. Tillerson that included some of his fiercest critics, including Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida who fought a losing battle for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to embrace the very establishment that he once scorned is partly a reflection of the difficulty that Mr. Tillerson faces in his confirmation battle.Over the past several days, Republican and Democratic lawmakers warned that Mr. Tillerson would face intense scrutiny about his relationship with Russia and with Mr. Putin. Mr. Tillerson has been publicly skeptical about Russian sanctions, which have halted some of Exxon\u2019s biggest projects in Russia, including an agreement with the state oil company to explore and pump underground resources in Siberia that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.Democrats seized on Mr. Tillerson\u2019s background as the leader of an oil company to raise doubts about his commitment to environmental issues. A native of Wichita Falls, Tex., who speaks with a strong Texan twang, Mr. Tillerson, 64, runs a company with operations in about 50 countries, and has cut deals to expand businesses in Venezuela, Qatar, Kurdistan and elsewhere.President-elect Donald J. Trump has broken with decades of diplomatic practice in freewheeling calls with foreign leaders.\u201cHe and other company executives led Exxon Mobil in funding outside groups to create an illusion of scientific uncertainty around the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change,\u201d Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, said in a statement.Ms. Tanden, who has been a longtime confidante of Hillary Clinton, added, \u201cThis decades-long misinformation campaign directly narrowed the world\u2019s window of opportunity to cut emissions and avert the catastrophic effects of climate change.\u201dAmnesty International said in a statement that \u201cRex Tillerson\u2019s nomination is deeply troubling and could undermine human rights in the U.S. and abroad.\u201dMr. Perkins also cited Exxon\u2019s financial donations to Planned Parenthood, calling them \u201cupsetting at best.\u201dMr. Trump appeared unfazed by the potential roadblocks to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s confirmation. In his statement making official his decision to nominate Mr. Tillerson, the president-elect lavished praise on the Exxon executive for his business acumen and knowledge of the world.\u201cHis tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for secretary of state,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cRex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none.\u201dMr. Tillerson said in the statement that he shared Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for \u201crestoring the credibility of the United States\u2019 foreign relations,\u201d and he vowed to \u201cfocus on strengthening our alliances, pursuing shared national interests and enhancing the strength, security and sovereignty of the United States.\u201dSenator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who was a finalist to become Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state and will oversee confirmation hearings as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued an enthusiastic statement.\u201cMr. Tillerson is a very impressive individual and has an extraordinary working knowledge of the world,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cI congratulate him on his nomination and look forward to meeting with him and chairing his confirmation hearing.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer and Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "For Better or Worse: New Books Forecast the Next Technologies", "Date": "2016-12-29", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhat do we do about the futurists?For the last few years, the professional conference circuit has been overrun by keynote speakers from San Francisco, bearing job titles like chief optimist and commanding five-figure fees to tell us how lucky we are to be living in a glorious new technological era. From coast to coast, every insurance-sales and dental hygienist convention now features one of these puffy paeans to technology. Robots! Augmented reality! The Internet of Things! All of these innovations will leave us richer, happier and more productive, the futurists tell us, and why not believe them?But futurism in the time of Donald Trump feels fraught. After all, the techno-optimists completely missed the signs of an impending revolution in their backyards: the spread of fake news enabled by social networks; the megaphonic power of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed; the rise of the so-called alt-right, a racist, neo-fascist clique that festered on 4chan and Reddit before emerging as a viable political movement. As a result, we fawned over self-driving cars and next-generation artificial intelligence while questions about the politics of all this new technology \u2014 the emotional backlash from manufacturing workers losing their jobs to automation, the interference of foreign hackers in American elections, the ability of partisan opportunists to flood Facebook with propaganda \u2014 went mostly unanswered.In her book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking,\u201d Amy Webb, the founder of the Future Today Institute, gives us a sophisticated but fairly narrow view of the future. She limits her forecasts to trends in technology, since, as she writes, \u201ctechnology is the unilateral source of nearly all of the significant things that have changed the world in the past 500 years.\u201d (There were a few wars in there, too, but let\u2019s concede the premise.)To predict trends, Webb writes, you begin by looking to the fringe, identifying the misfits and early adopters doing bizarre experiments and tinkering with emerging technologies. You look for hidden patterns in the use of these technologies and apply a six-step rubric Webb calls Cipher (contradictions, inflections, practices, hacks, extremes, rarities) to analyze which ones are likely to catch on and reach the mainstream. Then, when you have a trend firmly in hand, you create a strategy to capitalize on the trend, and \u201cpressure-test\u201d that strategy before taking action.Like most modern futurism, Webb\u2019s advice is directed primarily at an audience of entrepreneurs and executives trying to figure out how to stay ahead of the competition. But there is more to the future than making money, and \u201cHow will this trend affect my bottom line?\u201d is, truthfully, one of the easier questions a futurist can answer. It doesn\u2019t take an oracle to predict that automation will displace factory workers, that Crispr gene-editing techniques will lead to a boom in pharmaceutical research or that drones will influence the shipping industry. Much harder is anticipating the downstream effects of these changes on a broader group of people, and it\u2019s here that Webb and her futurist peers often resort to hand-waving and generalities.Webb cites Uber as an example of a transformational technology. The ubiquitous ride-hailing app succeeds, she writes, because it \u201cleverages our basic human needs and desires in a meaningful way and aligns human nature with emerging technologies and breakthrough inventions.\u201d (And here I thought it was just the cheap fares.) Webb writes that Uber \u201cmight transform how we think about logistics \u2014 not just in the realm of taxis and black cars, but in how we move around people, packages, groceries, pets and just about everything else.\u201d She imagines a near future of agriculture in which self-driving Uber harvesters dig up crops on farms, place them into self-driving Uber trucks and automatically deliver them to customers. In this Uber-centric future, she writes, \u201ca significant portion of the human-powered jobs in logistics will be obviated.\u201d She then moves on, as if the massive labor shock she has just predicted will produce nothing more consequential than robot-farmed rutabagas.But wait. What happens when the 3.5\u202fmillion Americans who drive trucks for a living and the three\u202fmillion Americans who work on farms get booted from their jobs by Uber-bots? What kind of social safety net might soften the blow of that kind of sudden mass unemployment? What kind of political movement might oppose the rise of a new, monopolistic techno-agricultural power? What are the ecological implications of putting food production in the hands of Silicon Valley tech companies? These are the biggest, most important questions, and the ones on which futurist thinking is most conspicuously absent.In \u201cWhiplash,\u201d Joi Ito and Jeff Howe apply futurist thinking to a broader set of problems. Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, and Howe, a visiting scholar there, are more careful to avoid the kind of futurist fortunetelling that ends in discrete, falsifiable predictions. Instead, they put forth broad theories of technological change, accompanied by examples from their work at the Media Lab. The rise of decentralized crypto-currencies like Bitcoin is an example of \u201cpull over push\u201d; the runaway success of Scratch, a rudimentary programming language for kids, typifies the theory of \u201ccompasses over maps.\u201dIto and Howe \u2014 who, like Webb, wrote their book before the 2016 election and can be forgiven for their lack of clairvoyance \u2014 are generally optimistic about the future, which they believe will be governed by \u201cemergent systems\u201d rather than top-down rule-making. \u201cUnlike authoritarian systems,\u201d they write, \u201cemergent systems foster the kind of nonlinear innovation that can react quickly to the kind of rapid changes that characterize the network age.\u201d Left unmentioned is the possibility of a movement like the alt-right, which supports authoritarianism despite having highly reactive, grass-roots origins.To their credit, Ito and Howe don\u2019t gloss over the dangers of distributing power to the masses. Nor do they engage in the hackneyed fantasy that our coming techno-utopia will lift billions out of poverty, free us from the burden of work and lead us into a glorious future of leisure and abundance. Justifying the value of alarmism in times of technological upheaval, they write, \u201cObserving institutions of immense economic and social value stumble blithely into a buzz saw struck us as less dinner party conversation and more four-alarm fire.\u201dThey\u2019re right. In our uncertain times, the work of futurism is more important than ever and should be done by people with sufficient imagination about how things could go wrong. Dystopian sci-fi and TV shows like \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d are a necessary corrective to the cheerleaders of Silicon Valley, but in the age of Trump, they\u2019re not enough. We need serious, thoughtful people to grapple with the implications of innovation and help us recognize the ways that new technology, if placed in an unstable political climate and seized upon by malevolent actors, could result in harm and hardship. The futurists can help us navigate the storms ahead, but first, they need to take off the rose-colored binoculars.Kevin Roose is the vice president of editorial at the Fusion channel, and the executive producer and a co-host of its series \u201cReal Future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great A.I. Awakening", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "FeatureHow Google used artificial intelligence to transform Google Translate, one of its more popular services \u2014 and how machine learning is poised to reinvent computing itself.Supported byLate one Friday night in early November, Jun Rekimoto, a distinguished professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Tokyo, was online preparing for a lecture when he began to notice some peculiar posts rolling in on social media. Apparently Google Translate, the company\u2019s popular machine-translation service, had suddenly and almost immeasurably improved. Rekimoto visited Translate himself and began to experiment with it. He was astonished. He had to go to sleep, but Translate refused to relax its grip on his imagination.Rekimoto wrote up his initial findings in a blog post. First, he compared a few sentences from two published versions of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Takashi Nozaki\u2019s 1957 translation and Haruki Murakami\u2019s more recent iteration, with what this new Google Translate was able to produce. Murakami\u2019s translation is written \u201cin very polished Japanese,\u201d Rekimoto explained to me later via email, but the prose is distinctively \u201cMurakami-style.\u201d By contrast, Google\u2019s translation \u2014 despite some \u201csmall unnaturalness\u201d \u2014 reads to him as \u201cmore transparent.\u201dThe second half of Rekimoto\u2019s post examined the service in the other direction, from Japanese to English. He dashed off his own Japanese interpretation of the opening to Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,\u201d then ran that passage back through Google into English. He published this version alongside Hemingway\u2019s original, and proceeded to invite his readers to guess which was the work of a machine.NO. 1:Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai \u201cNgaje Ngai,\u201d the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.NO. 2:Kilimanjaro is a mountain of 19,710 feet covered with snow and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. The summit of the west is called \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in Masai, the house of God. Near the top of the west there is a dry and frozen dead body of leopard. No one has ever explained what leopard wanted at that altitude.Even to a native English speaker, the missing article on the leopard is the only real giveaway that No. 2 was the output of an automaton. Their closeness was a source of wonder to Rekimoto, who was well acquainted with the capabilities of the previous service. Only 24 hours earlier, Google would have translated the same Japanese passage as follows:Kilimanjaro is 19,710 feet of the mountain covered with snow, and it is said that the highest mountain in Africa. Top of the west, \u201cNgaje Ngai\u201d in the Maasai language, has been referred to as the house of God. The top close to the west, there is a dry, frozen carcass of a leopard. Whether the leopard had what the demand at that altitude, there is no that nobody explained.Rekimoto promoted his discovery to his hundred thousand or so followers on Twitter, and over the next few hours thousands of people broadcast their own experiments with the machine-translation service. Some were successful, others meant mostly for comic effect. As dawn broke over Tokyo, Google Translate was the No. 1 trend on Japanese Twitter, just above some cult anime series and the long-awaited new single from a girl-idol supergroup. Everybody wondered: How had Google Translate become so uncannily artful?Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, stood to make a few opening remarks. A friend, he began, had recently told him he reminded him of Google. \u201cWhy, because I know all the answers?\u201d the mayor asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the friend replied, \u201cbecause you\u2019re always trying to finish my sentences.\u201d The crowd tittered politely. Khan concluded by introducing Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who took the stage.Pichai was in London in part to inaugurate Google\u2019s new building there, the cornerstone of a new \u201cknowledge quarter\u201d under construction at King\u2019s Cross, and in part to unveil the completion of the initial phase of a company transformation he announced last year. The Google of the future, Pichai had said on several occasions, was going to be \u201cA.I. first.\u201d What that meant in theory was complicated and had welcomed much speculation. What it meant in practice, with any luck, was that soon the company\u2019s products would no longer represent the fruits of traditional computer programming, exactly, but \u201cmachine learning.\u201dA rarefied department within the company, Google Brain, was founded five years ago on this very principle: that artificial \u201cneural networks\u201d that acquaint themselves with the world via trial and error, as toddlers do, might in turn develop something like human flexibility. This notion is not new \u2014 a version of it dates to the earliest stages of modern computing, in the 1940s \u2014 but for much of its history most computer scientists saw it as vaguely disreputable, even mystical. Since 2011, though, Google Brain has demonstrated that this approach to artificial intelligence could solve many problems that confounded decades of conventional efforts. Speech recognition didn\u2019t work very well until Brain undertook an effort to revamp it; the application of machine learning made its performance on Google\u2019s mobile platform, Android, almost as good as human transcription. The same was true of image recognition. Less than a year ago, Brain for the first time commenced with the gut renovation of an entire consumer product, and its momentous results were being celebrated tonight.Translate made its debut in 2006 and since then has become one of Google\u2019s most reliable and popular assets; it serves more than 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day in a different language. It exists not only as its own stand-alone app but also as an integrated feature within Gmail, Chrome and many other Google offerings, where we take it as a push-button given \u2014 a frictionless, natural part of our digital commerce. It was only with the refugee crisis, Pichai explained from the lectern, that the company came to reckon with Translate\u2019s geopolitical importance: On the screen behind him appeared a graph whose steep curve indicated a recent fivefold increase in translations between Arabic and German. (It was also close to Pichai\u2019s own heart. He grew up in India, a land divided by dozens of languages.) The team had been steadily adding new languages and features, but gains in quality over the last four years had slowed considerably.Until today. As of the previous weekend, Translate had been converted to an A.I.-based system for much of its traffic, not just in the United States but in Europe and Asia as well: The rollout included translations between English and Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. The rest of Translate\u2019s hundred-odd languages were to come, with the aim of eight per month, by the end of next year. The new incarnation, to the pleasant surprise of Google\u2019s own engineers, had been completed in only nine months. The A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime.Grinning, Pichai read aloud an awkward English version of the sentence that had been rendered by the old Translate system: \u201cOne is not what is for what he writes, but for what he has read.\u201dTo the right of that was a new A.I.-rendered version: \u201cYou are not what you write, but what you have read.\u201dIt was a fitting remark: The new Google Translate was run on the first machines that had, in a sense, ever learned to read anything at all.The phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is invoked as if its meaning were self-evident, but it has always been a source of confusion and controversy. Imagine if you went back to the 1970s, stopped someone on the street, pulled out a smartphone and showed her Google Maps. Once you managed to convince her you weren\u2019t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\u2019t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \u2014 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \u201cA.I.,\u201d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d are thus constantly receding.The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Facebook\u2019s M, Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\u2019t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer. Management consultants are falling all over themselves to prep executives for the widening industrial applications of computers that program themselves. DeepMind, a 2014 Google acquisition, defeated the reigning human grandmaster of the ancient board game Go, despite predictions that such an achievement would take another 10 years.It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\u2019s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \u2014 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \u2014 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \u2014 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\u2019s \u201cmicrokitchens\u201d \u2014 the \u201cGoogley\u201d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\u2019s buildings \u2014 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \u201cneural networks,\u201d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\u2019s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\u2019s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \u201c20 percent\u201d \u2014 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \u2014 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \u201cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\u201d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\u2019s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\u2019s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\u2019s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \u201cminister of agriculture\u201d as \u201cpriest of farming.\u201d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d better than math and chess.There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\u2019t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.There has always been another vision for A.I. \u2014 a dissenting view \u2014 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\u2019t. What\u2019s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\u2019t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \u2014 sensory perception and motor control \u2014 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\u2019t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \u2014 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 and drew upon both the company\u2019s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \u2014 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.\u201cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\u201d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \u201cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\u2019ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\u201d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\u2019s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \u201cType in your LDAP\u201d \u2014 a user login \u2014 and he would flag a helper to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s an LDAP?\u201d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \u201cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\u2019t he get it?\u201d\u201cAt lunchtime,\u201d Hinton said, \u201csomeone in the queue yelled: \u2018Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\u2019 After that, it was all right.\u201dHinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\u2019s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \u201cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\u201dHinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\u2019s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \u201cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\u2019d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \u2014 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \u2014 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.The issue with multilayered, \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\u2019s easy. Imagine that you\u2019re playing with a child. You tell the child, \u201cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\u201d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \u201cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\u201d The child tries Box A. Bravo.These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \u201cconnectionism\u201d or \u201cparallel distributed processing.\u201d \u201cThis idea,\u201d Hinton told me, \u201cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\u2019s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\u2019\u2009It wasn\u2019t a very persuasive argument.\u201dTo understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\u2019re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\u2019t how they work. All they\u2019re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \u2014 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \u2014 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\u2019re feeding them is biased in the first place.If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \u201ccat.\u201d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \u201cNot cat.\u201d It is hyperliteral, or \u201cbrittle.\u201d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \u201cvoters,\u201d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \u201cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\u201d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \u201cA dog?\u201dYou say: \u201cNo, maestro, it\u2019s a cat. Try again.\u201dNow the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \u201ccat\u201d and which didn\u2019t. The ones that got \u201ccat\u201d right get their votes counted double next time \u2014 at least when they\u2019re voting for \u201ccat.\u201d They have to prove independently whether they\u2019re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\u2019s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\u2019s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\u2019s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\u2019s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \u201cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \u2018cats.\u2019\u2009\u201d The more \u201cvoters\u201d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \u2014 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\u2019s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\u2019s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \u201cdumbbell\u201d but the concept of \u201cdumbbell+arm,\u201d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\u2019s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\u2019s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?\u201cBut actually,\u201d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \u201cit\u2019s very hard.\u201d\u201cThere was a big debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cA very big debate.\u201d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\u2019d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a big debate.\u201dHe remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \u201cThis is the future.\u201d It was, he said, an \u201cunpopular decision at the time.\u201d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\u2019t quite understand Le\u2019s decision. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked Le in an email.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good answer back then,\u201d Le said. \u201cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\u201d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\u2019s ideas. \u201cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\u201dWhat happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \u2014 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\u2019t specify what it should or shouldn\u2019t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \u201cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\u201d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \u201csummarize\u201d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \u2014 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \u2014 the machine couldn\u2019t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\u2019s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \u201cchose\u201d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\u2019t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.Le didn\u2019t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\u2019t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\u2019s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\u2019s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\u2019t help myself and began to ask, \u201cIs he ... ?\u201d Le nodded. \u201cAt Facebook,\u201d he replied.)The hundred or so current members of Brain \u2014 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \u2014 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\u2019s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)When I began spending time at Brain\u2019s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \u201cJesse, 6/27.\u201d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.Brain\u2019s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \u201csuccess disaster\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the company\u2019s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.\u201cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis is how many machines we\u2019ll need.\u201d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.\u201cThat,\u201d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \u201csounded scary. You\u2019d have to\u201d \u2014 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \u2014 \u201cbuild new buildings.\u201dThere was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \u201ctensor processing units,\u201d and their value proposition \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\u2019s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \u201cNormally,\u201d Dean said, \u201cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\u201dLe\u2019s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \u2014 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\u2019s model didn\u2019t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\u2019t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \u201cYou think,\u201d Schuster says, \u201cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\u2019re done, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201dThe issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\u2019s code was custom-written, and it wasn\u2019t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\u2019s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\u2019t always make heads or tails of what they had done.As Schuster put it, \u201cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\u2019t know themselves why they worked.\u201dThis February, Google\u2019s research organization \u2014 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \u2014 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\u2019s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \u201clightning talks,\u201d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \u201cfacilitated discussions.\u201d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \u201cWe ambushed him.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \u201cWe have something to tell you.\u201dThey told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \u2014 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \u2014 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \u201cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\u201d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\u2019t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\u2019s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\u2019s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \u2014 and something akin to meaning.Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \u2014 not in a lab but at production scale \u2014 for years, to little avail.Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.Dean thought otherwise. \u201cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\u201d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \u201cif we put our minds to it.\u201dHughes was sure the conversion wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\u2019t personally care to be the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s prepare for 2016,\u201d he went back and told his team. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\u2019t deliver speed.\u201dA month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\u2019s new system with Hughes\u2019s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \u201cEnglish-French,\u201d he said, \u201cis so good that the improvement won\u2019t be obvious.\u201dIt was a challenge Schuster couldn\u2019t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.Hughes told Schuster\u2019s team they hadn\u2019t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.To be sure this wasn\u2019t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \u2014 Schuster, Wu and Chen \u2014 but with Hughes\u2019s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\u2019s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\u2019s case there was no ambiguity.The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \u201cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\u201d Schuster told me at one point. \u201cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\u201d \u2014 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \u2014 \u201cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\u201d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\u2019s there.\u201dMost of Google\u2019s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.\u201cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\u201dThe theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \u2014 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \u201cmere\u201d engineering \u2014 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\u2019s billions of words of training \u201creading\u201d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \u201cwords.\u201d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\u2019t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \u201cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\u2019s like a toddler. \u2018Oh, Daddy says that word when he\u2019s mad!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201dMore than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\u2019t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\u2019t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\u2019t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\u2019t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\u2019s service.Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\u2019t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t know to make it fast enough, but I don\u2019t know what it could be.\u201dHe did know, though, that they needed more computers \u2014 \u201cG.P.U.s,\u201d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \u2014 for training.Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \u201cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\u201dSchuster said, \u201cWhy not 2,000?\u201dTen days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \u2014 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \u201cPeople were almost yelling,\u201d Schuster said.By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \u201cword-piece model,\u201d a \u201ccoverage penalty,\u201d \u201clength normalization.\u201d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \u2014 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \u2014 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?\u201cWe did hundreds of experiments,\u201d Schuster told me, \u201cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\u2019re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\u2019m done? You never know you\u2019re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\u2019s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\u2019s hard for some people. It\u2019s a little bit an art \u2014 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\u201dThe Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \u201cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \u2018Oh, I did something first,\u2019 but who cares, in the end?\u201dThis did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\u2019t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a new system yet,\u201d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \u201cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\u2019s exploding on Twitter: \u2018Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.Google\u2019s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\u2019s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\u2019s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \u201cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\u201d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \u2014 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \u201ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\u201dTheir neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \u201cstep function forward\u201d \u2014 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.\u201cTo communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand cooperation!\u201dThe engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \u201cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\u201dEveryone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\u2019t.Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\u2019s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \u201cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\u201d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \u201cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\u201dFor the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\u2019t assume that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \u2014 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\u2019re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\u2019s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a machine \u2018knows\u2019 or \u2018understands\u2019 but what it \u2018does,\u2019 and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 what it doesn\u2019t do yet.\u201dWhere you come down on \u201cknowing\u201d versus \u201cdoing\u201d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\u2019s media reception. \u201cDid you see the first press?\u201d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\u2019. Over the final weeks of the paper\u2019s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\u201d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\u2019t about replacing people but helping them.And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \u201cinsight,\u201d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\u2019s antagonists, you can\u2019t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\u2019t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s causing the cancer.Then again, can the radiologist?Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \u2014 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\u2019re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\u2019re just telling you it\u2019s there.Once you\u2019ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \u2014 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \u2014 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \u2014 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\u2019re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\u2019re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\u2019s institution-building \u2014 and the consolidation of power \u2014 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \u201cninja\u201d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \u2014 for they\u2019re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \u2014 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \u2014 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\u2019s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, \u201cSo when do we get to delete it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe new code base is going to grow. Everything grows.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a computer used in space travel. A computer was used to guide Apollo missions \u2014 not the \u201cApollo shuttle.\u201d (There was no such shuttle.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harsh Facebook Posts, Jail and Now Death: A Man\u2019s Fate Angers Algeria", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byTUNIS \u2014 The Algerian government is coming under criticism for its treatment of a freelance British-Algerian journalist, Mohamed Tamalt, who died in a hospital on Sunday after being imprisoned under a draconian new law that criminalizes offending the president and state institutions.Mr. Tamalt, 42, was arrested in June, sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment and fined for \u201cdefaming a public authority\u201d and insulting the president. Posts on his Facebook page had often harshly attacked senior politicians and military officials, including the country\u2019s ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika.He went on a hunger strike to protest his incarceration and was hospitalized in August. He spent the last three months in a coma, said Abdelkader Tamalt, his brother.The prison administration announced that Mohamed Tamalt had suffered a stroke, which had required surgery, and that his condition had deteriorated recently because of a lung infection.But his brother said that in a visit to the hospital, he saw that Mr. Tamalt had sustained a serious wound to the back of the head, and that he suspected the injury was the cause of his hospitalization and coma.\u201cWhen I last saw him in prison, he was O.K., then in hospital he is in a coma,\u201d Mr. Tamalt\u2019s brother said by telephone. \u201cI am sure the injury has something to do with that. The injury that he had at the back of the head is the real reason that he fell into a coma.\u201dMr. Tamalt\u2019s death is an embarrassment for Algeria\u2019s authoritarian government, and it exposes the often hidden pressures applied to the independent news media to enforce control.Some of that rivalry has played out in the news media, including leaks by insiders to newspapers exposing the corruption of some government officials and an explosion of critical commentary on social media. The government reacted by amending the penal code in February, making \u201cinsulting the head of state\u201d and \u201cinsulting a state constituent body\u201d criminal offenses.Mr. Tamalt, who was based in Britain, completed a master\u2019s degree there and obtained British citizenship, seems to be the first to fall foul of the new libel laws. He returned in June after about 15 years abroad and was notably outspoken.He collaborated as an independent journalist with several Arabic-language newspapers, most notably El Khabar. His Facebook page included posts that were sometimes aggressively critical of the government, politicians, military officials and even their families, but it also celebrated a reunion with his grandmother after years abroad. While his writings and methods were not always admired, he was liked for his joyful mood and funny tone.Mr. Tamalt was not arrested by the police but by intelligence agents, said Salima Tlem\u00e7ani, a journalist who specializes in security and court issues.At a funeral on Monday attended by hundreds, Abdelkader Tamalt said his brother had been harassed, deprived of sleep and brutalized by prison guards in his cell. Their family has demanded an inquiry into the conditions of the detention and is suing the prison administration, said Mohamed Tamalt\u2019s lawyer, Amine Sidhoum.Human rights organizations have also demanded an independent and transparent inquiry.\u201cThis news is a very heavy blow for all those who defend freedom of information in Algeria,\u201d Yasmine Kacha, the director of the North Africa bureau of the rights organization Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement.\u201cThe message sent by this tragic event is terrifying: How to explain that Tamalt\u2019s state of health was allowed to deteriorate without doing anything?\u201d she said.Algeria\u2019s independent news media did not at first rally behind Mr. Tamalt, since much of the material he produced was poorly sourced and seemed to cross the line into libel, but it did report growing demands for his release and now for an investigation into his death.\u201cHe was unfortunately much too often into libeling and sullying people\u2019s private life that would justify judicial proceedings in any country,\u201d said Hadjer Guenanfa, a reporter with the news agency Tout Sur l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie. \u201cBut there was also some kind of overzealousness from the regime side.\u201dIhsane El Kadi, the editor of an online business newspaper, Maghreb Emergent, who met Mr. Tamalt several times, said he had been \u201cobsessed with writing against the regime.\u201d\u201cThey could and should have freed him when his physical condition became critical, if only through a presidential pardon,\u201d he said.The British government has said little on the case. British consular staff members had visited Mr. Tamalt during his detention and provided him with consular services. \u201cWe are saddened by his death,\u201d a spokesman at the British Embassy in Algiers said by telephone on Wednesday.Tayeb Louh, Algeria\u2019s minister of justice, said the government was not responsible for Mr. Tamalt\u2019s death. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe have neither the right nor the power to prevent someone from staging a hunger strike, and neither the right nor the power to intervene in court decisions.\u201dAmir Jalal Zerdoumi contributed reporting from Algiers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Plays Hard to Get With Celebrities and Influencers", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The musician Jay Sean has visited the headquarters of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Instagram has reached out to tutor him on the best time to post photos for maximum impact.But there is one social media service Mr. Sean has not heard from, even though he frequently uses the app to post spontaneous snippets of his life: Snapchat.Instead of giving celebrities like Mr. Sean special treatment, Snapchat limits their perks and treats them like typical users. Instead of courting influencers, who are regular people with large followings on social media and who often promote products, the app is taking a hands-off approach with them.\u201cSnapchat serves a different purpose,\u201d Mr. Sean said. \u201cOn Snapchat, I really know my fans. They don\u2019t like anything too contrived or too staged on Snapchat.\u201dSnapchat says it prefers that celebrities use the app like everyday users, rather than as a platform to sell products. The company\u2019s terms of service prohibit getting paid to post, making influencer marketing a no-no. The company, based in Venice, Calif., said it does not want to harm Snapchat\u2019s image as a place where people go to interact with their friends.\u201cSnapchat is now in a very big battle for habitual users,\u201d said Grant Owens, the chief strategy officer of Critical Mass, a digital ad agency. While Snapchat makes money from advertising, Mr. Owens said, remaining relatively marketing-free will help the company differentiate itself.Google\u2019s YouTube even helped create a new category of online celebrity \u2014 the influencer \u2014 by elevating popular video creators on the platform. And Instagram supports celebrities and influencers by sharing data that can help them attract larger audiences.These moves have pushed many people to seek social media fame; some even try to make a living by selling products to their followers. These influencers have formed guilds, are supported by agents and are paid when they slip products into photos of themselves having fun and looking stylish.Snapchat does not cater to these groups. Instead of having celebrities and influencers make product placements on the service, Snapchat tightly controls its ads, which must meet a high bar, according to advertisers. The ads are typically designed to mirror the look and the feel of videos and photos that users already see on the messaging service.Yet for a social media company to eschew celebrities and influencers is risky.\u201cYou\u2019d be crazy not to serve them well, because they represent a large amount of engagement and activity on most platforms,\u201d said Michele Anderson, the chief operating officer of the media consulting firm Activate. To ignore influencers, she said, is a \u201cshortsighted business risk.\u201d\u201cYouTube, I have a rep and they help me out with anything,\u201d Mr. McBride says in the video. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to people at Instagram about how Instagram stories work and we work together on stuff. Snapchat, I don\u2019t really have a point of contact, and they\u2019re not really embracing their creators.\u201dIn an email, Mr. McBride said his relationship with Snapchat did not change after he posted the video.Snapchat is not celebrity-free. Apart from Mr. Sean, television personalities like Ryan Seacrest and musicians like Rihanna use the service. Last fall, the company rolled out \u201cofficial stories,\u201d a feature that identifies videos and pictures posted by widely known public figures like Michelle Obama and Jessica Alba. Only a few hundred Snapchat accounts have the official story designation, which are marked with an emoji and are easier for users to find than regular accounts.The tennis star Serena Williams became part of the official stories this year. She said she liked the upgrade because it \u201cmakes it easy for anyone to find me.\u201dYet celebrity accounts are not given other types of common preferential treatment. Their posts are not presented in a newsfeed, and an algorithm does not prioritize their content and automatically feed it to users. People must also choose to follow celebrity accounts and then opt to watch their stories. And Snapchat does not encourage celebrities to focus on metrics, nor does it reveal the number of followers a user has in the app.\u201cSnapchat isn\u2019t about the numbers,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cSnapchat is for my real fans.\u201dThe actor and comedian Kevin Hart, who has an official story account, also said the service gave him a more genuine connection with fans.\u201cSnapchat is where I go to connect with them in a fun, natural way,\u201d he said.Arielle Vandenberg, an actress and social media star with more than 900,000 followers on Instagram, said she had found it hard at first to build a following on Snapchat. Still, she has started using the app more than any other.\u201cIt feels like way more of a connection between me and the person who is watching,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I post a picture on Instagram, it could be taken two weeks ago. If I post on Snapchat, it\u2019s right there in the moment with the audience.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Sapna Maheshwari from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Obama and Netanyahu, a Final Clash After Years of Conflict", "Date": "2016-12-23", "News": "Supported byThe White House bristled at the attack, denying that it was behind the resolution but defending the decision to abstain rather than veto it as consistent with longstanding, bipartisan American opposition to Israeli settlement construction as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians.The Israeli statement was \u201cfull of inaccuracies and falsehoods,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, told reporters on a conference call. The president, he said, tried repeatedly to bring the rivals together at the negotiating table, only to see Israel continue building more housing in the occupied West Bank in a way that would make a peace agreement even harder to broker.\u201cWe tried everything,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. In effect, he added just after Friday\u2019s United Nations vote, Mr. Netanyahu had it coming. \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsent this acceleration of settlement activity, absent the type of rhetoric we\u2019ve seen out of the current Israeli government, I think the United States likely would have taken a different view.\u201dThe clash just four weeks before Mr. Obama leaves office culminated a fractious eight years between the men. From the start, the two did not see eye to eye. Idealistic and perhaps overconfident, Mr. Obama arrived in the White House certain that he could be the president who would finally resolve the decades-old dispute between Israelis and Palestinians. But Mr. Netanyahu saw a na\u00eff who failed to grasp the existential threat to Israel and who demanded more of his friends than his enemies.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s critics in Israel said the Amona controversy and proposed legislation to legalize other outlaw outposts were responsible for Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to abandon Israel\u2019s government on Friday.\u201cNetanyahu chose to advance the legalization bill, insisted on Amona and galloped into the wall in full knowledge that this would be the result \u2014 while choosing his personal interest over the national interest,\u201d Tzipi Livni, a former foreign minister, wrote on Facebook.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s team rejected that. \u201cI think the legalization bill had nothing to do with this,\u201d said Michael Oren, a deputy minister and former ambassador to the United States, although he conceded that \u201cit would have been good to discuss the legalization bill at a later time just because of questions like that.\u201dMr. Oren said the real obstacle to peace was Palestinian incitement, not Israeli settlements. The United Nations was hypocritical, he said, because it singled out Israel while ignoring scores of other territorial disputes around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s not only an anti-Israel resolution but an anti-Semitic resolution,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is deeply troubling that this biased resolution appears to be the final word of the administration on this issue,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement.If it is the last word \u2014 and there are still 27 days left in the Obama presidency \u2014 it will serve as a coda to a relationship that never clicked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shadow of Amazon, European Challenger Looks to China for Inspiration", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it.\u201cWe wanted to take that experience back to Europe,\u201d Mr. Gentz said.This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe\u2019s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world\u2019s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent\u2019s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess.The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando.These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley heavy-hitters a run for their money across the region, still one of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 markets.\u201cIf you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional e-commerce player,\u201d said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary move.\u201dZalando\u2019s inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges.Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox Net-a-Porter, may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on e-commerce.For most Americans \u2014 and even some Europeans outside its core German-speaking markets \u2014 Zalando is not a household name.To meet the needs of Europe\u2019s national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders.\u201cZalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,\u201d said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London.Still, the company remains a relative minnow \u2014 its $9.5 billion valuation is one-fortieth that of Amazon. And Europe\u2019s fast-growing online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by e-commerce giants.To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape.On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on push-scooters sped through Zalando\u2019s first custom-built logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more \u2014 from Italy to Germany \u2014 are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London.As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando\u2019s I.P.O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion.For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando\u2019s website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility.\u201cNo one else offers this level of partnership,\u201d said Roland Auschel, Adidas\u2019s head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.The e-commerce company has also offered up its in-house advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with \u201conline influencers,\u201d or personalities with large social media followings.For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger.\u201cIn the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,\u201d Mr. Borg said.\u201cThat is our biggest challenge,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do we change the online experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Millions of Immigrants, a Common Language: WhatsApp", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhen Facebook bought WhatsApp for more than $19 billion in 2014, Jan Koum, a founder of the messaging company, arranged to sign a part of the deal outside the suburban social services center where he had once waited in line to collect food stamps.Tales of immigrant woe are not unusual in Silicon Valley. But Mr. Koum\u2019s story carries greater resonance because his app has quietly become a mainstay of immigrant life. More than a billion people regularly use WhatsApp, which lets users send text messages and make phone calls free over the internet. The app is particularly popular in India, where it has more than 160 million users, as well as in Europe, South America and Africa.Because it\u2019s free, has a relatively good record on privacy and security, and is popular in so many parts of the world, WhatsApp has cultivated an unusual audience: It has become the lingua franca among people who, whether by choice or by force, have left their homes for the unknown.This is happening as the world is increasingly at war over migration; 2016 was, among other things, a prolonged and pitched battle over the rights and privileges of migrant people, whether Syrians in Europe, Europeans in Britain\u2019s fight over Brexit, or the issue of Mexican and Muslim immigration that dominated the American presidential race.Beyond the headlines, what has often gone unnoticed in the politics of migration are the shifting dynamics of migrant life \u2014 particularly the surprising and subtle ways in which technology, especially smartphones and social networks, has altered the immigrant experience.Immigrants use lots of different apps, of course, from Facebook to Skype to WeChat, which is popular in China. But for many, WhatsApp has been at the center of a newfound connectedness. Wherever there are people leaving their homes for uncharted shores, you are likely to find WhatsApp. For migrants, it has become the best way to stay connected along a route, or, once they have landed, to keep in touch with the people they left back home.Even for people who have left their home countries voluntarily to pursue jobs and wealth in a new place, WhatsApp has thoroughly altered the contours of immigrant life. People who have been in the United States for decades told me that WhatsApp has eased the feeling of isolation and longing that is inherent to being an immigrant.\u201cI do have much more of a sense of their daily lives,\u201d said Anne Reef, 55, a former English professor, who moved from South Africa to the United States in 1988. She now lives in Memphis and has taught at, among other places, the University of Memphis.Calling internationally was a costly affair during Professor Reef\u2019s earliest days in America; she would rely on a once-a-week phone call for news from home. There were often letters, sometimes containing pictures of newborns and weddings. Faxing became a thing in the 1990s, and later she found email, Skype and Facebook. But it wasn\u2019t until she started using WhatsApp about a year ago that Ms. Reef began to feel a qualitative change in her connection with her far-flung family.A relative who lives in Australia \u2014 the son of Ms. Reef\u2019s first cousin \u2014 recently had a baby. With WhatsApp, Ms. Reef said, she gets to see a stream of baby pictures. \u201cI feel much more involved with the baby\u2019s life \u2014 I feel like I know him, and that he\u2019s become more than a third cousin to me,\u201d she said.This might sound pedestrian; after all, baby pictures on the internet aren\u2019t revolutionary. But WhatsApp\u2019s innovations tend to be subtle. One of the secrets to WhatsApp\u2019s growth has been a focus on simplicity. The app is purposefully unflashy, and it does just a few things \u2014 texts, voice calls and video calls. As a result, it is supremely easy to use even for people who are neophytes to digital technology. This is one reason immigrants find it so powerful; it has given them access to a wider set of relatives who might have shunned the social networks that came before.Adoption of WhatsApp often follows a curious pattern \u2014 older relatives often suggest it to younger ones, rather than the other way around.\u201cMy aunt, who\u2019s in her late 70s, was the one who really pushed me to get on it,\u201d Ms. Reef said. Now, she said, she uses it nearly every day; lately she\u2019s even gotten her children to use it.WhatsApp\u2019s ubiquity is also important. Because it has become essentially the primary mode of communication between people back in the motherland \u2014 whether your former home is Bangalore, India; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Johannesburg or Paris \u2014 for people who leave, it becomes something like a window into an old life.\u201cI have a group that has my mother\u2019s side of the family, and then another group that is my husband\u2019s side of the family, and all day long it\u2019s just messages to each other,\u201d said Mina Mehta, 65, a surgical technician in Chicago, who moved to the United States from India with her husband in 1975.\u201cIt\u2019s this constant feedback of news from people back home, and you get to hear about parts of their lives that they wouldn\u2019t have mentioned in a once-a-week phone call,\u201d Hemant, Ms. Mehta\u2019s son, told me.\u201cWhat WhatsApp did was demystify the journey,\u201d he said. In the earliest days of the Syrian civil war, some of the first refugees leaving Syria faced a receptive welcome in European countries.\u201cPeople would have a group with their friends, and one of them would make it to the other side, and send them back a message telling them what the trip was like, and sharing photos,\u201d Mr. Taby said. \u201cThat\u2019s what caused a lot of people to decide to do it. They\u2019d seen exactly what was going to happen on WhatsApp.\u201dWhatsApp itself does not keep tabs on how the app has been embraced by immigrants; a spokeswoman told me that because communications on the app are encrypted, the company has no way to know when people are communicating internationally.But Mr. Koum, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an email that immigrant users are an important constituency.\u201cA lot of us at WhatsApp were born in other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognize how important it is for people to connect with family thousands of miles away, because it\u2019s something we think about a lot.\u201d Every feature in the app, he added, \u201cwas designed in part by someone living the immigrant experience every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin Won\u2019t Expel U.S. Diplomats as Russian Foreign Minister Urged", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced Friday that he would not retaliate against President Obama\u2019s decision to expel Russian diplomats and impose new sanctions \u2014 only hours after his foreign minister recommended doing just that.Mr. Putin, betting on improved relations with the next American president, said he would not eject 35 diplomats or close any diplomatic facilities, rejecting a tit-for-tat response to the actions taken on Thursday by the Obama administration.Mr. Putin even said he did not want to close a wooded picnic area on a Moscow River island used by diplomats because he did not want to deprive their children. Then he went one step further, inviting all children of American diplomats accredited in Russia to celebrate the New Year and the Russian Orthodox Christmas with him at the Kremlin.President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for trying to influence the 2016 election through cyberattacks. Here\u2019s what led to the sanctions.\u201cPutin showed that he is above his own officials, that he doesn\u2019t want to take the retaliatory action suggested by his foreign minister,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, an international relations analyst and columnist. \u201cThis is an attempt to show that he is a figure not just of worldly scale, but of planetary.\u201dShould Mr. Putin have chosen to retaliate harshly against the United States, he would most likely have deepened the rift between the two countries and left President-elect Trump with a nettlesome diplomatic standoff from the moment he arrived in the Oval Office.But by choosing essentially to disregard Mr. Obama\u2019s punitive measures, Mr. Putin can try to disarm his American critics, including members of Congress who consider him an aggressive foe of the United States. That could give Mr. Trump more room to pursue the closer cooperation with Russia that he has advocated.Despite all of the statements from senior officials about the need to respect \u201creciprocity,\u201d Mr. Putin essentially warned Washington that he was waiting for the Trump administration \u2014 a tactic not unlike the one adopted by Israel in its recent rejection of a peace plan laid out by Secretary of State John Kerry.\u201cMoscow wanted Trump to have room to maneuver,\u201d Mr. Frolov added. \u201cThis decision is a clear gesture of good will toward him.\u201dMr. Putin called it \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the Obama administration chose to end its relationship with Russia in such a way, but he sent a New Year\u2019s greetings to Mr. Obama, his family, Mr. Trump and \u201call the American people.\u201dJust hours earlier, Mr. Lavrov had recommended that 31 American diplomats be expelled from Moscow and four from St. Petersburg. He also recommended the closing of two facilities: the picnic area used by diplomats, as well as a warehouse in the southern, industrial part of the Russian capital.\u201cOf course, we cannot leave such mischievous tricks without a response,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said. \u201cReciprocity is the law of diplomacy and of international relations.\u201dHow U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.The actions amounted to the strongest American response yet to a state-sponsored cyberattack.In addition to giving the Russian diplomats and their families 72 hours to leave the country, the measures announced by Mr. Obama imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s two main intelligence services. Washington described the diplomats as intelligence agents working under the cover of diplomacy.Russia announced it would send a special plane to collect the diplomats and their families by the Jan. 1 deadline.The economic sanctions covered three main areas, including blocking Russian access to international credit, cutting off cooperation in advanced oil field technology and stopping arms deals or the sale of dual-use technology.Much of their effect stemmed from the fact that they coincided with a sharp drop in global oil prices, hitting Russia with a double blow. Companies had trouble obtaining credit, driving up the short-term cost of borrowing and compounding a deep recession. Over the long run, the effect is likely to be strongest in the oil sector because it dried up most exploration in difficult areas like the Arctic.Russia responded with sanctions of its own, mostly banning agricultural products and certain foods imported from the West. Mr. Putin and other officials have repeatedly crowed that this resulted in a successful campaign of \u201cimport substitution.\u201dRussia also maintained a secret list of Western officials who were no longer allowed into the country.

One young father said he was just grateful that his children were too small to realize that the family was being followed.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But it is written so loosely that some worry it might drag booksellers down.\u201cI can understand why booksellers are concerned,\u201d said Michael Risher, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. of Northern California. \u201cThe law is an invasion into privacy and should be amended.\u201dThe legislation began with an effort by State Representative Ling Ling Chang to broaden a 1992 law about sports memorabilia. She joined forces with Mark Hamill, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor who kept seeing signed posters that were fake. Booksellers say they didn\u2019t realize they were vulnerable until after Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure in September.But some booksellers worry that is not true. If a bookseller does not vouch for a signed book in the form of a \u201ccertificate of authenticity,\u201d he is liable for a civil penalty equal to 10 times actual damages, plus court costs and other charges.Even those who keep an eye on the memorabilia trade don\u2019t think the law will do much good.\u201cReal criminals can circumvent the law with little effort, and yet the measure creates a huge disincentive for honest businesses,\u201d said Jason DeBord, who runs a blog about the market for movie and television props.The booksellers hope the next Legislature will clarify the law. That will not be easy though. Ms. Chang, a Republican, narrowly lost her bid to join the State Senate, and will be out of office.Two-year-olds Erika and Eva Sandoval, conjoined since birth from the chest down, slept in different beds on Tuesday.After a tense 17-hour surgery at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford, the little girls from Antelope, near Sacramento, were separated for the first time, hospital officials said.\u201cThe twins did very well,\u201d Dr. Gary Hartman, the lead surgeon, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased. This is as good as we could have asked for.\u201dThe happy outcome was far from certain.According to medical research cited by the Stanford hospital, there was a 30 percent chance that at least one of the girls would die during the procedure.Conjoined twins are rare, occurring in as few as one out of 200,000 births, the hospital said. Entering the surgery, the Sandoval girls shared a liver and a bladder.

{"Headline": "Women\u2019s March and Bikers for Trump Claim Inaugural Demonstration Spots", "Date": "2016-12-12", "News": "Supported byThe contentious election of Donald J. Trump has inspired a record number of groups, from bikers to minority-rights activists, to make plans to arrive in Washington around the time of his inauguration on Jan. 20, either to target his administration or voice support for it.The Women\u2019s March on Washington and Bikers for Trump are among the groups organizing demonstrations outside the wide stretches of land, from the Lincoln Memorial to the Ellipse near the White House, that have been blocked off by the National Park Service for more than a year and are essentially on reserve for Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.\u201cIn a normal election cycle, we\u2019ll see four or five First Amendment applications,\u201d Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said in an interview, referring to requests for demonstration permits. This year, there are 20.Mr. Cox, who did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday, added in the video that he has requested for 500 bikers to ride in Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural parade and that he would know this week if his request had been approved.John Marshall Park is outside the areas reserved for inaugural festivities and was not doled out by the inaugural committee, Mr. Litterst said.On Monday, Cassady Fendlay, a spokeswoman for the march, said at least 30 advocacy groups have become partners with the march to spread the word and to raise money. The groups include Girls Who Code, Define American, Amnesty International, the Trayvon Martin Foundation, and the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.The anger among Trump opponents about the outcome of the election has lead to a \u201cmassive groundswell of grass-roots organizations\u201d that now wish to come and speak their minds, including on the day after the inauguration, Ms. Verheyden-Hilliard said. \u201cNow they\u2019re being told there is no ground to do so near the White House.\u201dMore than a year ago and under regulations established in 2008, Mr. Litterst said, the Park Service began filing requests to reserve large sections of Washington \u2014 including most of Lafayette Park, the Ellipse, most of the National Mall, land near the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, and other main thoroughfares \u2014 for the presidential inauguration committee of the winning candidate.\u201cWe are currently in court litigating Inauguration Day access to parkland adjacent to the parade route for free speech activities,\u201d Ms. Verheyden-Hilliard said.Organizers who have had their events approved will have to help coordinate (and pay for) the logistics of hosting a demonstration, Mr. Litterst said, considering everything from portable toilets to helping coordinating bus arrivals.Meanwhile, Mr. Cox has told Bikers for Trump attendees to start searching for hotel rooms in the Washington area.An earlier version of this article misstated, based on information provided by the Women\u2019s March on Washington, the role of the National Council of Jewish Women in the coming event.

One of their questions: Will a Trump administration undercut the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that insurers cover birth control free of charge?If such a reversal occurs, it would land at a time of strikingly innovative efforts to expand the availability of birth control that have so far proven popular and largely uncontroversial.Some accept insurance, including Medicaid, while some charge modest fees.But public health experts think the benefits will go beyond convenience, by encouraging more women to start, restart or continue using contraception and reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions.Two extraordinary transplants made medical history in 2016.

For countless procedures they\u2019re turning to short-acting treatments like nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, guided nerve blocks or ketamine nasal sprays.

{"Headline": "How the Twinkie Made the Superrich Even Richer", "Date": "2016-12-10", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 4Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.Supported byThe snack cakes flew through the air into the crowd pressed against metal barriers. One man shoved cream-filled treats into his mouth. Another \u201cToday\u201d host tucked Twinkies into the neckline of her dress.Across the nation in the summer of 2013, there was a feeding frenzy for Twinkies. The iconic snack cake returned to shelves just months after Hostess had shuttered its bakeries and laid off thousands of workers. The return was billed on \u201cToday\u201d as \u201cthe sweetest comeback in the history of ever.\u201dNowhere was it sweeter, perhaps, than at the investment firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, which spent $186 million in cash to buy some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake bakeries and brands in early 2013.Less than four years later, they sold the company in a deal that valued Hostess at $2.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos have now reaped a return totaling 13 times their original cash investment.Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives like those at Apollo have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone, took home the largest haul last year: nearly $800 million. He and other private equity executives receive more annually than the leaders of Facebook and Apple, companies that revolutionized the way society communicates.The top executives at those six publicly traded private equity firms earned, on average, $211 million last year \u2014 which is about what Leon Black, a founder of Apollo, received. That amount was nearly 10 times what the average bank chief executive earned, though firms like Apollo face less public scrutiny on pay than banks do.Private equity firms note that much of their top executives\u2019 wealth stems from owning their own stock and that they have earned their fortunes bringing companies back to life by applying their operational and financial expertise. Hostess, a defunct snack brand that was quickly returned to profitability, is a textbook example of the success of this approach.Yet even as private equity\u2019s ability to generate huge profits is indisputable, the industry\u2019s value to the work force and the broader economy is still a matter of debate. Hostess, which has bounced between multiple private equity owners over the last decade, shows how murky the jobs issue can be.In 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy under the private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. Months later, with Ripplewood having lost control and the company\u2019s creditors in charge, Hostess was shut down and its workers sent home for good.Without investment from Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess brands and all those jobs might have vanished forever after the bankruptcy. The way these firms see it, they created a new company and new jobs with higher pay and generous bonuses.But the new Hostess employs only 1,200 people, a fraction of the roughly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs at Hostess\u2019s snack cake business during the 2012 bankruptcy.And some Hostess employees who got their jobs back lost them again. Under Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess shut down one of the plants they reopened in Illinois, costing 415 jobs.The collapse and revival of Hostess illustrates how even in a business success, many workers don\u2019t share in the gains. The episode also provides a snapshot of the economic forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the White House.Since losing his job at Hostess in 2012, Mark Popovich has had three jobs, including one that paid about $10 an hour, half what he made at the Twinkie-maker. A lifelong Democrat and devoted \u201cunion man,\u201d Mr. Popovich said he supported Mr. Trump, the first time he ever voted Republican.\u201cIt\u2019s getting old, getting bounced around all the time,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, a 58-year-old Ohio resident.Such frustrations stem from broader shifts in the economy, as all types of companies turn to automation to cut costs and labor unions lose their influence. While these changes have helped keep companies profitable, private equity has used these shifts in the workplace to supercharge wealth far beyond that of the typical chief executive.And yet, Mr. Trump did not focus on private equity on the campaign trail, instead blaming the plight of the American working class on a shadowy cabal of elitist Democrats and Wall Street bankers who support trade deals that ship jobs overseas.\u201cPeople understand jobs going to China,\u201d said Michael Hillard, an economics professor at the University of Southern Maine. \u201cBut no one has ever heard of these private equity firms that come in and do all this financial engineering. It is much more complicated and less visible.\u201d\u201cAt a time when many Americans are concerned about the country\u2019s economic viability, private equity has proven itself in communities throughout the United States as an effective solution,\u201d said James Maloney, the American Investment Council\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSustainable growth strategies, adherence to responsible investments and a long-view approach are all a part of the present-day private equity model.\u201dThe Times investigation of the Hostess deal shows that today\u2019s private equity also uses another set of tactics, like special dividends and tax arrangements, that maximize profits in creative, yet financially risky ways.Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life.A year after the layoffs at the Hostess plant in Illinois, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for the company to borrow about $1.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos used most of that sum to pay themselves, and their investors, an early dividend on their investment.The firms also found a way to make money even after the company was sold. The firms, The Times investigation found, struck a deal to collect as much as $400 million over the next 15 years, based on what Hostess\u2019s future tax savings might be.These winnings do not come without risk to the private equity firms, which are often taking a gamble on troubled companies, and when they fail, the firms probably lose out.And this is not a simple story of powerful investors enriching themselves while some workers struggle. Teachers and firefighters also benefit from private equity.Pension funds that pay retirement benefits to public servants now depend on private equity to generate huge returns. Without it, taxpayers could bear more of the costs.\u201cHostess\u2019s comeback was a win-win-win-win,\u201d an Apollo spokesman said in a statement, adding that its investment benefited workers, communities, investors and consumers. \u201cAfter teaming up to take on the daunting financial and operational challenge of creating a new company around the Hostess brand, Apollo and Metropoulos & Co. completed a highly successful private equity investment.\u201dOn a more basic level, Americans enjoy what private equity has owned: GNC vitamins, affordable jewelry at Zales, and birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.It may seem an unusual choice, but this party had a special affinity for the snack cake. The bride\u2019s father is an executive at Apollo.Leon Black grew up in a family that had a home in Westport, Conn., and an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard Business School.But when Mr. Black traveled to Lubbock, Tex., to speak to a group of retired teachers, he emphasized a humbler side of his pedigree.\u201cYou should know,\u201d Mr. Black said, according to a video recording of the February 2012 meeting, \u201cmy mother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my brother-in-law is a teacher. We have a lot of teachers in our family.\u201dMr. Black had good reason to flatter the retirees: Pension funds for teachers and other public workers are some of the biggest investors in Apollo\u2019s funds and have helped make Mr. Black a very rich man.Mr. Black, or an affiliated limited liability company, owns homes in Beverly Hills, Miami Beach and several locations in New York, an analysis of real estate records shows. This year, he bought the $38 million house in Beverly Hills that had belonged to the actor Tom Cruise.Private equity\u2019s relationship with pension funds is mutually beneficial. As countless baby boomers reach retirement at a time of historically low interest rates, public pension funds need to achieve returns that match their liabilities \u2014 and private equity has delivered.Nearly half of private equity\u2019s invested assets now come from public and private pensions around the world. Private equity uses this pension fund money to place bets on companies like Hostess, and Texas teachers have shared in the profits from the deal.The Teacher Retirement System of Texas has invested in the fund that bought Hostess. And that fund has reaped 27 percent net during the three years it owned Hostess, significantly more than the stock market returned in that period.\u201cYou need to get people in whom you trust and who will keep up our fund,\u201d said Fran Plemmons, a former president of the Texas Retired Teachers Association who was a teacher and principal for 25 years. \u201cIf they do that, you need to get out of the way.\u201dMs. Plemmons said her $31,200 yearly pension allows her to live modestly but comfortably. High returns from private equity investments, she said, help keep pension payments flowing to retired school workers across Texas, which trickles down into the local economy.For the teachers in Lubbock, Mr. Black described the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind its success: buying the debt of financially troubled companies or purchasing an entire company. The investments, he said, are \u201cvalue-oriented, if not contrarian.\u201dHostess fit that formula.Not only were Americans turning to healthier snacks and eating less junk food, but Hostess had its own challenges.In 2012, the baking company had gone through a bruising bankruptcy, its second in a decade. The company laid off most of its 18,500 unionized drivers, loaders and bakers, not long after the bakers\u2019 union voted for a companywide strike rather than accept another round of concessions.But what was disaster for previous owners looked like treasure to Apollo and Metropoulos.When Hostess lenders auctioned off the company in early 2013, Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake brands, which included Twinkies and Ding Dongs.Snack cakes still produced some of the highest profit margins in the food industry and Hostess cakes were particularly well-known. The bankruptcy also provided Apollo and Metropoulos a clean slate, liberating them from union contracts, labor rules and debt and pension payments.One group of workers who had no place at the new Hostess: the unionized drivers, who transported snack cakes and bread to grocery stores nationwide.Now, Hostess would send its baked goods to warehouses, where retailers like Walmart would ship to individual stores.Ronald Litland, 44, delivered Hostess products in Illinois for 10 years. After he was laid off in 2012, he enrolled in a for-profit college in hopes of finding a new career in information technology. When his unemployment benefits ran out, he delivered pizzas. He never finished school, but is still paying back student loans and taking care of his son.\u201cI have a hard time making ends meet,\u201d said Mr. Litland, who earns about $24,000 a year.Like the drivers, Hostess\u2019s baking operation was also cut back. Apollo and Metropoulos chose to buy only a handful of its roughly one dozen snack cake bakeries.Other parts of the former Hostess baking empire were scaled back as well. Food companies picked off some of Hostess\u2019s bread brands, but reopened only a small fraction of the bakeries.Before being laid off from Hostess, Mr. Popovich made about $20 an hour. Every year, he went on vacation in the Bahamas or St. Martin. His health insurance covered the $385,000 cost when his wife needed major surgery.\u201cI lived a good life,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, whose most recent job driving a forklift at a solar panel plant paid about $16 an hour.Mr. Popovich is also entitled to a pension, which he was promised after working more than two decades at Hostess. But he recently received a letter at his home in Toledo, Ohio, warning that the pension fund was nearly insolvent.Apollo and Metropoulos are not obligated to contribute to the pension fund, which is managed by a labor union. Nor do they have to pay the severance that Hostess was obligated to pay Mr. Popovich when he was laid off. Those liabilities were wiped out in the bankruptcy.At a brick bakery in Schiller Park, Ill., Twinkies started rolling off the line nearly a century ago. And when Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s cake plants and brands out of bankruptcy in 2013, Schiller Park\u2019s plant was one of the fortunate few to reopen.\u201cSchiller Park, We \u2665 You,\u201d read a billboard that Hostess sponsored in the town, the heart carved into the image of a half-eaten Twinkie.The celebration was short-lived. Just over a year after the plant\u2019s grand reopening, Hostess shut it down.The fallout was swift. All 415 employees were fired, some for the second time in two years. Schiller Park lost one of its largest employers, creating a ripple effect through this tiny working-class suburb of Chicago. The plant itself, an institution so old that it predated nearby O\u2019Hare International Airport, was suddenly vacant.\u201cWe got our hopes up again,\u201d said the town\u2019s mayor, Barbara J. Piltaver. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, we had a big hit.\u201dThe story behind the rise and fall \u2014 and fall again \u2014 of the Schiller Park plant encapsulates private equity\u2019s relationship with workers and labor unions.In Schiller Park, Janice Ryan worked at the Hostess plant for about 20 years before the 2012 bankruptcy. She walked to work from her nearby home. And she was relieved to return, after several months of unemployment, to be part of what many workers believed was the company\u2019s long-term comeback.Schiller Park was a starting point for getting Twinkies back on the shelves by summer 2013. As part of that push, many Schiller Park employees worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, and could volunteer for a seventh day.\u201cWe were all proud of what we accomplished,\u201d said Michael Spina, who worked for Hostess for many years in St. Louis and then moved to Schiller Park to help manage production when the plant reopened.What the workers were never told, however, was that Apollo and Metropoulos had no plans to keep Schiller Park in operation over the long term.\u201cSchiller, in essence, was a contingency plan, opened only to ensure that initial demand could be met,\u201d Hannah Arnold, a Hostess spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added that the setup of the bakery \u2014 its low ceilings and lack of a loading dock \u2014 was not conducive to the company\u2019s future plans. The company says it could not tell workers of its plans because of labor rules.The expendability of Schiller Park reflects Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s plans to run a more efficient operation than their predecessors did. And that model requires far fewer workers than the one that existed for decades.In 2012, Hostess had about 8,000 employees and eight bakeries dedicated exclusively to snack cakes. Six other plants produced at least some desserts. Today, the new Hostess has only three plants and 1,200 workers.At Schiller Park, some workers earned a dollar less per hour than what workers were paid under the previous owners. Others earned more, the company said. Still, they qualified for bonuses, owed no union dues and received health insurance and dental care. Instead of pensions, they were enrolled in 401(k) plans.Former employees recalled grueling shifts when temperatures inside the plant neared 110 degrees. The workers were given Gatorade to rehydrate.\u201cBakeries are hot places,\u201d Mr. Spina said. \u201cBut Schiller Park could really be a hot son of a bitch.\u201dVeronica Pacheco, who lives in Schiller Park and joined the Hostess bakery when it reopened in 2013, described \u201cfreezing\u201d wintertime conditions that were equally arduous. She said she wore scarves and heavy gloves under her work garments.Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, noted that prospective employees answered a questionnaire about whether they were willing to work in \u201cextreme seasonal temperatures.\u201d The company said it spent about $100,000 upgrading the heating and air-conditioning system, but stopped short of a total overhaul.There were other hazards as well. In 2014, Todd Kemp was injured after heaps of Twinkie mix spilled on the factory floor, causing him to slip and injure his shoulder, back and knee. He has since had four operations.Ms. Arnold said Apollo and Metropoulos inherited old equipment, some of it in disrepair, adding that Schiller Park \u201cwas in the worst condition of the four bakeries by far.\u201dC. Dean Metropoulos, the billionaire Greek immigrant whose firm has invested in other well-known food brands like Vlasic pickles and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, personally oversaw the upgrading and cleaning of the facility, Ms. Arnold said.\u201cHe also focused on ensuring workers had new uniforms and better shoes, to make long days standing more comfortable,\u201d she said.Over the long term, Apollo and Metropoulos looked outside Schiller Park to generate profits.Hostess employed \u201cextended shelf-life technology\u201d to make the Twinkie, already jokingly thought to be capable of surviving nuclear war, even more everlasting.The company perfected its secret recipe until it contained the right amount of enzymes to better retain moisture. The enzymes extended shelf life of some products to 65 days from 26 days.The company also turned to automation. At a plant in Emporia, Kan., Hostess installed an automated baking system that churned out more cakes with fewer workers.William Toler, Hostess\u2019s chief executive, said the company spent more than $140 million \u201cto get the business up and running, and certainly our results suggest we made very good choices.\u201dThe Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga., had another advantage: government subsidies. The state\u2019s economic development agency provided Hostess with tax credits to push along the deal. The Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs.\u201cWe\u2019re not doing it to be nice guys, we\u2019re doing it to create jobs,\u201d said Wylly Harrison, who worked on the deal for the Georgia Department of Economic Development and said that the state was thrilled Hostess came back.Hostess said it also received incentives from Emporia, the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis. Employment totals at those plants have since increased.Hostess did not receive any incentives in Illinois.Three workers interviewed by The Times said they believed that the final straw for Schiller Park was when they voted to rejoin a union.Hostess fought the effort. The company plastered the plant with posters urging workers to vote \u201cno.\u201dThe union prevailed, but not for long. Around the time union officials had planned to start contract negotiations in August 2014, Hostess announced it was shutting down the Schiller Park plant.Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, said the unionization vote did not factor into the decision to close Schiller Park. Employees, she said, were provided severance and an opportunity to apply for a Hostess job in another state.Union officials declined to comment.Since then, unions have made limited inroads at Hostess. Whereas 83 percent of the work force was unionized in 2012, Hostess recently said in a securities filing that about 30 percent of employees belonged to a union in Indianapolis and Columbus. Its flagship facility, Emporia, is not unionized.\u201cBoth Apollo and Metropoulos have owned and operated numerous companies that had union employees,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, adding that \u201cMetropoulos has always enjoyed good, working relations with unions and their members.\u201dFor all the profits Apollo and Metropoulos squeezed out of the Hostess factories, a deal hatched in a hotel room on Fifth Avenue in New York shows how private equity can have its snack cake and eat it, too.There, in the Versailles Room at the St. Regis, Apollo and Metropoulos began the process of extracting returns from the company, less than a year after shutting the Schiller Park plant.Most investors seeking profit have to wait for the right moment to sell a company or take it public. But private equity uses a different playbook.First, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for Hostess to borrow money from the banking giant Credit Suisse. The two firms then pocketed about $900 million of that money for themselves and their investors. Hostess, meanwhile, is stuck repaying the debt.This type of deal is known as a dividend recapitalization, and it is a staple of private equity\u2019s money-making strategy. These deals provide private equity firms an opportunity to profit before they even sell a company, an added bonus to the firms and their investors, including public pensioners.Since 2012, private equity firms have arranged hundreds of such deals, totaling over $148 billion in debt, according to Thomson Reuters. Hostess\u2019s dividend deal was the third largest of 2015.This financial engineering is crucial to private equity\u2019s success \u2014 and to building the personal fortunes of the industry\u2019s executives. With each dividend recapitalization, more money pours into Apollo, which then flows to the firm\u2019s executives.It comes with risks. Of all the companies that carried out dividend recapitalizations since 2012, about 10 percent have faced a credit rating downgrade within six months of the deal, according to LCD/S&P Global Market Intelligence and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings, which notes that many factors could lead to a downgrade, including excessive debt.Although Hostess has not been downgraded, it now describes itself in public filings as \u201chighly leveraged.\u201dMr. Toler, the Hostess chief, said that even after the dividend payout, the company \u201chad plenty of capital to work with.\u201dAt the same time it was paying dividends to investors, Hostess earmarked $8 million to pay bonuses to workers, including those in the bakeries.And still, they arranged more ways to profit. Apollo and Metropoulos retained a combined 42 percent stake in the company, which is now publicly traded.After investing only $186 million in cash when they bought the company in 2013 (they took out debt to help finance the rest of the $410 million deal), Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s investment is now worth 13 times that initial cash investment.Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black\u2019s pocket is a byzantine task.Mr. Black collected a $100,000 salary and no bonus in 2015.How did Mr. Black, on such a relatively modest salary, come to acquire an art collection that is said to include one of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201c Scream\u201d series, which he bought in 2012 for about $120 million, then the highest price ever paid for a painting?The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries.Mr. Black\u2019s share of the Hostess profits, from the partial sale and the $900 million in cash they pulled out of the company, will be reflected in a series of distributions he collects from Apollo\u2019s publicly traded stock. The size of the distribution depends on the size of the profits from deals like Hostess.Last year, Mr. Black\u2019s distributions totaled $181 million.Other shareholders in Apollo \u2014 which include money managers like Fidelity \u2014 also receive these distributions. But Mr. Black, as the largest shareholder of a company he co-founded in 1990, gets the largest payout.While Mr. Black receives the most money at Apollo, one of his partners and co-founders, Joshua Harris, took home $121 million last year. Mr. Harris is part owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils.Mr. Black has noted that if Apollo\u2019s investments fail to make money, then its executives also miss out.Like most private equity firms, Apollo collects a management fee from investors and earns 20 percent of profits from the firm\u2019s investments, once its investors recoup their original money and reap profits of their own.Private equity\u2019s advantages don\u2019t end there. Apollo\u2019s share of the profits on Hostess or any deal ultimately flows to Mr. Black and his fellow shareholders in the company in ways that lower their tax burden.The industry\u2019s 20 percent cut of profits \u2014 also known as carried interest \u2014 is taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is roughly half the 40 percent ordinary income rate for the nation\u2019s highest earners. And since private equity executives receive much of their money from carried interest \u2014 or in the case of Mr. Black, distributions largely made up of carried interest \u2014 they enjoy a tax advantage over workers.This is what\u2019s known as the \u201ccarried-interest loophole\u201d \u2014 a tax treatment held up during the presidential campaign as evidence that the rich fail to pay their fair share.Private equity managers argue that this treatment is not a loophole or even unique to private equity. Its use originated from the cut of profits that ship captains reaped for \u201ccarrying\u201d goods.In the Hostess deal, Apollo and Metropoulos found even more ways to use the tax code to their advantage.The firms are entitled to collect a large portion of tax benefits that Hostess could earn well into the future. The idea is that by selling a stake in Hostess before they could realize these benefits, Apollo and Metropoulos could leave money on the table.These arrangements, which are now commonplace in private deals, allow the firms to collect cash from a company they may no longer own.The Hostess \u201ctax-receivable\u201d benefits, according to previously unreported securities filings and estimates by the Apollo spokesman, could provide Apollo and Metropoulos up to $400 million for the next 15 years or more.Looking out over those next 15 years, nothing seems guaranteed to Mr. Popovich, the former Hostess worker from Toledo. Right before Thanksgiving, Mr. Popovich was laid off from his most recent job at the solar panel plant.The idea of searching for work at age 58 is daunting. He has been sending out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but has not received a call back.\u201cIt\u2019s been four jobs in four years,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we go again.\u201dLeslie Picker, Kitty Bennett and Sara Olkon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Super Mario Run\u2019s Not-So-Super Gender Politics", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUnfortunately, despite Nintendo\u2019s history and reputation, Super Mario Run is not a family-friendly game \u2014 or at least not one my wife and I will be letting our 6-year-old daughter play. The game is rife with stale, retrograde gender stereotypes \u2014 elements that were perhaps expected in 1985, when the first Super Mario Bros. was released in the United States, but that today are just embarrassing.Super Mario Run begins, as does almost every Super Mario title, with Princess Peach becoming a hostage who must be rescued by Mario. Just before her ritual kidnapping, Peach invites Mario to her castle and pledges to bake him a cake. Upon her rescue, she kisses Mario. The game also includes a second female character, Toadette, whose job is to wave a flag before and after a race, like a character from \u201cGrease.\u201dBy failing to update Super Mario for a contemporary audience, Nintendo is lagging far behind the Walt Disney Co., one of its closest American analogues. Disney\u2019s film \u201cFrozen\u201d subverted and reinvigorated the fairy-tale princess movie; \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d gave us a female Jedi. Super Mario Run doesn\u2019t even try.In isolation, there\u2019s nothing wrong with princesses or baking. My daughters love those things, too. But Super Mario Run relegates its female characters to positions of near helplessness. Peach and Toadette become playable only after you complete certain tasks, which makes the women in the game feel like prizes. (To be fair, the same is true of a few male characters.) Worse, should you then use Peach to defeat her kidnapper, Bowser, you\u2019ll discover that neither Mario nor a kiss is waiting for her as a reward.The world would be a worse place if video game creators were judged only by whether they balanced their games with male and female protagonists. Some of 2016\u2019s best video games, including the interactive drama Firewatch and the disturbing Mario-inspired Inside, are largely about men and boys.Representation in interactive media may be even more important than it is in linear entertainment. In video games, players describe ourselves as the digital avatars we control on a screen. We say \u201cI died,\u201d not \u201che died.\u201d\u201cPlayers describe the experience of being with one as less like talking with a person and more like inhabiting someone else\u2019s mind,\u201d the social scientist Sherry Turkle wrote of video games in 1984 in \u201cThe Second Self,\u201d one year before Super Mario Bros. came to America. \u201cIn pinball you act on the ball. In Pac Man you are the mouth.\u201dThe knowledge that video games possess this power, that they allow us to adopt new identities and grant us new ways of seeing ourselves, is as old as Mario\u2019s quest for his princess. Which makes it all the sadder that Mr. Miyamoto, with all his gifts, has yet to seize it.Chris Suellentrop is a former editor for The Times\u2019s Op-Ed page and a host of the podcast \u201cShall We Play a Game?\u201d He is writing a book about video games.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kylie Jenner and the Year of the Drop", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe Year in Style 2016Last Friday, on a sunny December morning, chaos descended upon a glossy shopping mall in the Canoga Park section of Los Angeles.Thousands of young women (and a few men), many of whom had slept in the parking lot of the Westfield Topanga mall overnight or traveled from several states away, surged en masse at 10 a.m. toward a monochrome, recently erected temporary store on the first floor. Hours later, most shoppers were still there, waiting in snaking lines and shrieking intermittently. Others, their eyes downcast, tapped on smartphones.\u201cThe empire, it\u2019s all for you,\u201d Ms. Jenner said as she arrived to open her store, part of which she designed herself by taking inspiration from the bedroom of her mansion in Calabasas, Calif. (imagine a gigantic bed with white sheets, a pink neon autograph on black walls and video installation of Ms. Jenner in lingerie and a fur coat rolling around in bed with her rapper boyfriend, Tyga). She waved and blew kisses \u2014 the scene was streamed on Snapchat \u2014 before taking a few selfies with fans. Pandemonium ensued.[See more Year in Style articles]\u201cIn the e-commerce age, older consumers have shown that they want ease, convenience and plenty of variety from their shopping experience,\u201d said Avery Booker, the chief executive of Enflux, a digital influence-mining tool. But, he said, when it comes to Generation Z, those born in the years from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, and the younger millennials, \u201cin many cases the opposite is emerging.\u201d\u201cThey are excited not just by a product\u2019s rarity,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut also by what credibility owning that product can give them within their social media communities, as well as its possible resale value.\u201dThe flourishing secondary markets, fueled by online resellers and prompted by the growing clout of drop culture, has been one of the most significant changes to the retail landscape in recent years. Mere hours after the latest Kylie Lip Kit, Supreme sneaker or H&M/Alexander Wang piece has sold out on official distribution channels, these items are often available elsewhere on the internet, though with one or more zeros added to the price. For savvier fans, the use of auto-fillers or bots to skip the digital lines for valuable items is increasing.Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of the innovation group at advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, said Generation Z was far more entrepreneurial than its predecessors.\u201cIf millennials are digitally savvy, then Generation Z are total digital natives,\u201d Ms. Greene said. \u201cThey are completely au fait with the internet and social media platforms, and comfortable using them to create anything from fan forums to charities and their own minibusinesses. Their identities are defined by their interactions and relationships online, both with one another and celebrities.\u201cThat\u2019s why stars like Kylie Jenner, who interact with them like peers on the mediums they feel most comfortable with rather than more traditional retail platforms, are seeing such astronomical success.\u201dSome independent businesses are also recognizing new opportunities to profit and are building new services accordingly. Depop, which was started in Britain in 2012, is a buying, selling and swapping app for clothes, accessories and other wares. It created communities of influencers and like-minded shoppers and has strong roots in the resale market. Eighty percent of its user base is under 30.\u201cBrands like Supreme and Palace really understand successful 21st-century branding and how to appeal to younger consumers from the selfie generation,\u201d said Maria Raga, the chief executive of Depop. \u201cThere is no question that our business is capitalizing on their success. Many of the most successful resellers to emerge out of the drop culture don\u2019t just see what they do as a way of making money. They see it as a way of building their own brand. They can gain huge profiles and followings in their own right.\u201dIt\u2019s not necessarily in their nature to save the earnings from transactions either. \u201cTo keep up their social media credentials, Generation Z feel they need to change their clothing much quicker than shoppers in their late 20s upward,\u201d Ms. Raga said. \u201cPlus there is always a hot new pricey brand on the up. Most of them are students. They aren\u2019t really earning money yet. So to buy more, they need to keep selling stuff.\u201dCharles Fitchew, a 13-year-old in Manchester, England, is one example. He said he did 95 percent of his shopping online, with the traditional majority of any new purchases coming from drops. Lately, however, he said a growing number now came from transactions that took place on Facebook messenger chat groups, particularly for sneaker resales, which tend to be dominated by young men. (No surprise: Kylie Jenner\u2019s sales are predominantly driven by teenage girls and women in their 20s.)\u201cThese days, if you want the coolest stuff you have three options,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can queue up overnight outside a store before a drop or hope for the best online. You can go to an established site if you miss out or can\u2019t be bothered to wait, like eBay or Depop, but expect to pay double the original price.

You would think.But the president-elect wanted more. Romney was a \u201cchoker,\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s earlier put-down; that, and he walked \u201clike a penguin.\u201d If Romney could take his flightless bird-in-a-tuxedo-act outside and apologize for calling Trump a fraud, then maybe the job was his. Romney would waddle no further. Apologize? Cripes, the title of his book is \u201cNo Apology.\u201dStill, high-five! For Trump, the debasement of Romney was just another hit of dopamine \u2014 the neurotransmitter once called the Kim Kardashian of molecules. He needs a jolt several times a day. But in turn, he gives it back to you, the millions in his personality cult, and certainly the click-bait web and cable press, who need it just as much.Earlier this month, Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, took to the floor of the House to plead for one thing from the incoming leader of the free world: \u201cStop tweeting, Mr. President-elect.\u201d Not a chance. His tiny fingers can launch 140 predawn characters from the fortress of his gilded tower and mighty Boeing will lose more than a billion dollars in stock value a few hours later.At the other end, his 17.3 million followers wake up every day eager for a shot of unfiltered Trump. It\u2019s a dangerous codependency. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d? \u201cUnwatchable!\u201d Vanity Fair, after a scathing review of a Trump restaurant? \u201cDead!\u201d The slaughter of civilians in the ancient city of Aleppo? Nothing. The real-world consequences of weaponized hatred are no concern for a man with a shameful incuriosity and a profound lack of empathy.But look again at the Trump Tower stage \u2014 it\u2019s Kanye! Who cares about Aleppo, or a foreign adversary deliberately trying to undermine an American election, when you\u2019ve got a troubled rapper stopping by for his hit of Trump. The Orange One recognizes him \u2014 on CNN, now cutting away from Syria.And so we see the clear design that Trump will use to rule: He will give us showmanship and cheap drama, put-downs and promises \u2014 the stagecraft of the world\u2019s most powerful narcissist. And meanwhile, the nation will be governed by oil oligarchs, climate change deniers and Goldman Sachs tycoons brought in to do the real work.The Koch brothers didn\u2019t support Trump. But they got their dream team of hold-back-the-clock fossil fools and corporate sycophants. The bullet-headed nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, is against expanding the minimum wage for all the poor souls who voted for Trump. The Energy Department nominee, Rick Perry, vowed to eliminate that very agency. And he sits on the board of the pipeline company that wants to carry oil directly under a tribal water supply in North Dakota.Pay no attention \u2014 it\u2019s back on the road with the thank you tour. This traveling gloat-fest is an excuse for more of the Trump narcotic. He is having trouble getting A-list musicians to perform at his inauguration. The sound of an angry mob is music enough. The rallies are a contact high for both sides and \u2014 as in Wisconsin the other day \u2014 a chance for one more chant of \u201cLock her up!\u201dBut locking Hillary Clinton up for careless management of her email could be problematic when it seems that Trump\u2019s future national security adviser, the fake news enthusiast Michael Flynn, was himself investigated for wrongly sharing classified information with foreign leaders.Time for another tweet, a put-down of a union man who dared to question how Trump played Indiana workers for suckers in his big factory stroll. Trump helped to save, at most, a thousand jobs. If President Obama had held a big press tour for all the 15 million new jobs created on his watch, he could boast of 36,000 jobs, once a week, throughout his eight years in office.It\u2019s boring stuff, anyway. Just like that daily intelligence briefing, which Trump says he doesn\u2019t need because \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person.\u201d But more to the point: for Trump, there\u2019s no thrill in basic information. He\u2019ll certainly feel something if there\u2019s a catastrophic terrorist attack and, as with George W. Bush, there was an intelligence community warning of a looming threat.Back to Trump Tower \u2014 oh look, all the tech titans! They didn\u2019t back him, these captains of Apple and Facebook, Tesla and Amazon. And, given his record of boasting on tape of being a sexual predator, Trump couldn\u2019t get hired as deputy office boy at any one of those companies. But as with the Romney grovel, he gets another hit by bringing them to heel. For another day, at least, it\u2019s all a president-elect needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mother Nature Is Brought to You By ...", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThis year, parks in several states including Idaho and Washington, and the National Park Service, will be blazing a new trail, figuratively at least, as they begin offering opportunities to advertisers within their borders.King County already partnered with Chipotle to hide 30 giant replica burritos on parkland bearing the logo of the agency and the restaurant chain. People who found the burritos won prizes from Chipotle.The logic behind these efforts is, in its own way, unimpeachable. Many millions of people \u2014 that is, \u201cgreen consumers\u201d \u2014 visit parks every day, representing an unrealized marketing opportunity of great value. Yes, parks are meant to be natural, not commercial, but times are tough, or so say the backers of the new schemes.The spread of advertising to natural settings is just a taste of what\u2019s coming. Over the next decade, prepare for a new wave of efforts to reach some of the last remaining bastions of peace, quiet and individual focus \u2014 like schools, libraries, churches and even our homes.Some of this reflects technological change, but the real reason is the business model of what I call the \u201cattention merchants.\u201d Unlike ordinary businesses, which sell a product, attention merchants sell people to advertisers. They do so either by finding captive audiences (like at a park or school) or by giving stuff away to gather up consumer data for resale.Once upon a time, this was a business model largely restricted to television and newspapers, where it remained within certain limits. Over the last decade, though, it has spread to nearly every new technology, and started penetrating spaces long thought inviolate.Nor are our workplaces and social spheres immune. The time and energy we spend socializing with friends and family has, almost incredibly, been harnessed for marketing, through the business models of Facebook, Instagram and other social media. At the office, the most successful of the productivity-killing distraction engines, BuzzFeed, brags of luring a \u201cbored at work\u201d network hundreds of millions strong.Unfortunately, there is worse yet to come: The nation\u2019s most talented engineers now apply themselves to making marketing platforms out of innovations \u2014 A.I. assistants like the Amazon Echo or self-driving cars. Here the intrusions will be subtle, even disguised, so as not to trip our defenses, but they will be even more powerful, going after our very decision-making processes. Consider how much we already depend on Siri or Google Maps: What happens when our most trusted tools have mixed motives?Advertising revenue often seems like \u201cfree money,\u201d but there are enormous risks for the character of any institution once it begins to rely heavily on advertising income. History and logic suggest that, once advertisers become a major funding source, they create their own priorities, and unless carefully controlled they will warp the underlying space to serve their interests.This development raises questions beyond the mere issue of how annoying ads can be. The model of individual liberty and a self-reliant citizenry was proposed by the founders and influenced by philosophers like John Stuart Mill, who envisioned sufficient time and space for self-development of character and room for making decisions that are truly ours.Similar ideas about the prerequisite of free will are to be found in the great spiritual traditions, which sanctify certain times and spaces for the sake of our spiritual development.These ideals are threatened by a way of doing business that by its nature seeks to invade the most sanctified of spaces.If you don\u2019t like the sound of this future, resistance is not futile \u2014 it is necessary. A commercial dystopia can be averted only by private resistance and principled decisions by the leaders of institutions.The first simply requires redrawing the lines that have been eroded. Where once upon a time, tradition or religion drew those lines for us, blocking out times for family and faith, nowadays personal or family initiative are required to define parts of our lives as off limits. The default setting will always be intrusion and distraction. We need to flip the switch.The second should be to reduce the attention economy by patronizing businesses or institutions with subscription models or those that keep advertising within reasonable limits.Third, the leaders of schools, libraries and even the more principled technology firms should understand that there is always a hidden cost to the proposition offered by advertising. Once an institution is dependent on ad revenue, it\u2019s impossible to put the Crest 3D White Radiant Mint toothpaste back in the tube.Above all, we should not simply resign ourselves to a world saturated by commercial appeals at the cost of our private and sacred spaces. As the great legal scholar Charles Black Jr. once put it, \u201cI tremble for the sanity of a society that talks, on the level of abstract principle, of the precious integrity of the individual mind, and all the while, on the level of concrete fact, forces the individual mind to spend a good part of every day under bombardment with whatever some crowd of promoters want to throw at it.\u201dTim Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He is fascinated with sneaker culture. He is a vocal Knicks fan. He sits with students during lunchtime to talk about music. And he winces at the thought of being called Dr. Gabay. Some students simply call him \u201cG.\u201dA majority of his career has been spent in unconventional settings, teaching literature to students who had been locked up.During his four years at the academy, Mr. Gabay has broadened his role to become like an older brother to these struggling teenagers \u2014 many of whom have spent time in foster care or in jail. He is as adamant about nurturing them socially and emotionally as he is about preparing them to take tests.His motto: \u201cStudents need to know how much you care before they care how much you know.\u201d\u201cBrownsville has the worst schools in the city, the worst health care, the most homicides, the worst food \u2014 there are no Starbucks here \u2014 and I want to give them access to all the good things that I was blessed to have,\u201d said Mr. Gabay, who was born on the Lower East Side and grew up in Great Neck on Long Island.He networks relentlessly to open doors for his students.He brought in a spoken-word performer who inspired one young man to travel to Africa with the artist to study. After Mr. Gabay invited an Oscar-nominee, Jesse Eisenberg, to the school, the actor mentored a student who was passionate about the entertainment industry. When John Wallace, the former Knicks player, came to class, another student ended up with a job.\u201cPeople at school are like, \u2018Gabay, how do you do that?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s simple. Just reach out and say thank you,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a strategic thing; I think it comes from someone\u2019s heart.\u201dIt is not quite the same as the work done by large nonprofits; Mr. Gabay says he is much more informal, focusing on the little things \u2014 small deeds that can inspire one person, and have the potential to turn a life around.\u201cWhen you go places, you\u2019re always thinking: \u2018What can benefit the students?

{"Headline": "A Year of Big Ideas in Social Change", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byFixesSo far, of students in the program who had an average grade below a D in ninth grade, 73 percent managed to graduate, in a city where the overall average graduation rate for this group is 6 percent.Relationship-building has shown up a lot in Fixes this year as a method for tackling a wide variety of problems. It\u2019s one of several strategies that come up again and again. Here are our three nominations for the big ideas in social change we covered in 2016.Share a little of that human touch.Across the country from Baltimore, for years people in Washington State have been building community networks to improve their neighborhoods and cities. The push started with Washington\u2019s Family Policy Council, which was established in the 1990s to deal with youth violence. The group had a tiny budget \u2014 $4 million overall, or about a dollar for every person in the state. So what to do?In one particularly depressed area, the Highlands neighborhood of Longview, residents working together replaced broken porch lights; built or renovated a community center, garden and library; organized cleanup drives; began monthly chats with the police, and held free laundry days and bike giveaways.As in Baltimore, these efforts are also building connections and social capital. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to see a neighborhood association as another kind of infrastructure, like the streets, water or sewer system,\u201d said John Brickey, Longview\u2019s community development director. \u201cThe health of a neighborhood is just as dependent on it.\u201dUse tech to democratize.This strategy is pretty much the opposite of relationship-building. It\u2019s useful when the goal is to create wider availability for a product already being used by a small number of relatively wealthy people. One path is to use technology and data to make the distribution system more efficient and cheaper.Take green investing. For years, this has been a boutique affair. If you wanted to invest in ways that were good for the environment, you had to pay a stock-picker high fees and be prepared for low returns.Another example is civil legal aid. Even though people involved in civil cases can lose their apartments, their children and their jobs, the law does not guarantee them the services of a lawyer. In fact, it\u2019s very difficult for low-income Americans to get one.Many states are now considering laws that would make counsel a right in civil cases. Until that happens, we need other ways to get legal help to self-represented people.Insurance is standard in rich countries, but very rare in the poorest locales, where people need it more because they have no cushion against natural and economic crises. Millions of people live by herding cattle, for example, and climate-change-related drought is killing their herds. But selling them traditional insurance has been impossible, because in remote areas it\u2019s absurdly expensive to verify the death of an animal.Make the better choice the easy choice. When I lived in Latin America, one display of bad government I found in many places was this: Cities had lots of signs on the streets telling you not to litter \u2014 but no trash cans. People didn\u2019t need the government to tell them to dispose of their trash properly; they just needed trash cans. The key is to make it easy to do what\u2019s right.Look at teenage pregnancy and abortion. Some kinds of birth control, like pills or condoms, require women to remember to use them each day or each time they have sex. Others, called long-acting reversible contraception are devices women can have inserted or implanted once \u2014 and then not think about. \u201cSet and forget\u201d works better.For example, at first, the city wanted residents to take shorter showers. But mothers said showers were the only time in their day that they had to themselves. So officials chose easier goals at first, like offering free low-flow shower heads or shower head control valves that cut water use. Only later did they seek shorter showers.When the for-profit world tries to sell a product, tactics like asking target users for their ideas, piggybacking onto an activity consumers are doing anyway, or simplifying the buying process are so basic to efforts to sell us stuff that it\u2019s laughable to even discuss them. But they\u2019re not widespread in the nonprofit world \u2014 a pretty sad situation, since social change is often all about behavior change. Of course, reducing teenage pregnancy or encouraging organ donation isn\u2019t the same as selling soft drinks. But the nonprofits could learn a lot by studying how it\u2019s done.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Luxury Brands Seek a Way Into Generation Z", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayMillennials, the much-studied generation whose behavior has seduced and puzzled luxury brands in equal measure, are no longer the sole focus for companies hoping to attract new customers: Generation Z, the label given to those born since 1995, is the latest target audience, thanks to their future purchasing power and the influence they hold over the spending of their parents and grandparents.Unlike their older peers, who have watched technology gradually embed itself in their daily lives, members of Generation Z are known as \u201cdigital natives\u201d: those who cannot remember what it is like to not have a cellphone permanently attached to their hand.DigiTour Media hosts festivals where social media stars step out from behind their bedroom webcams and meet their teenage fan base. The festivals showcase people who have created mass followings on YouTube, Instagram and Musical.ly, the lip-syncing app with over 100 million monthly users and that anyone over 21 is unlikely to have heard of. DigiTour Media group now puts on approximately 200 events a year, comprising both DigiFests (one- or two-day showcases) or DigiTours (groups of performers who rove the United States). The combined reach of the acts is 350 million people.\u201cIt is all about bringing the internet to life \u2014 their internet to life,\u201d said Ms. Valiando Rojas at The New York Times\u2019s Global Leaders\u2019 Collective conference, held in Washington this past week. A former music executive, she recognized in 2010 that there was no equivalent of a music festival on the market for younger teenagers. She also saw that when it came to hormone-fueled popularity, 21st-century social media stars had as much clout as the biggest boy bands.\u201cGeneration Z are the most influential group of consumers right now. Whether or not they are buying luxury today, they will be tomorrow,\u201d Ms. Valiando Rojas said. \u201cSo understanding where they think, where they go and how to advertise to them without rubbing them up the wrong way is crucial.\u201dThat more and more people are looking for experience-led luxury purchases over products is another factor in why brands should be looking to build relationships with this demographic, both on and off their phones.There is a distinction between Generation Z and millennials in how they behave within their social media communities. Millennials are keen to be unique, but members of Generation Z want to be popular and part of a group. Having grown up immersed in social media, members of Generation Z define their identity by how many \u201cLikes\u2019\u2019 they get on Facebook or how many followers they have. They see their online personalities as extensions of themselves\u201cThat is why these influencers are so important: Teenagers today trust these voices,\u201d Ms. Valiando Rojas said, adding that she booked acts based on their popularity and what the followers of her company\u2019s social media accounts suggested. She pointed to Baby Ariel (age 16), Jacob Sartorius (age 14) and the Dolan Twins (age 16) as some of the biggest names to watch.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a lip-syncing app. It is musical.ly, not music.ly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: China Dreams of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byBitsFor decades, countries around the world have felt the effects on their culture of one of America\u2019s strongest exports: Hollywood cinema. For China, at least, it now seems to be Silicon Valley\u2019s turn.What\u2019s going on here? Partly, it seems, the Chinese corporate tourists are beguiled by the Valley\u2019s dreamlike promises of changing the world and growing filthy rich almost overnight. Nothing too surprising there; in fact, not too different from the Hollywood fare so heavily consumed around the world.There\u2019s more to it than that, however. As Mr. Mozur writes, China has many accomplished technology companies, but they struggle with Confucian and Communist traditions of respecting order, consensus and seniority. Their American counterparts, raised on stories of pioneers on the frontier, thrive in a supposed ethos of \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201dThose are the exceptions, and for the most part Chinese tech is pretty slow-moving, particularly in the more government-sponsored areas, like semiconductors. Companies like Baidu, which champion a Chinese version of fast-moving Valley culture, are newer.Even there, when employees want to learn how to be more Valley-like, they are issued a copy of \u201cBaidu Analects,\u201d a kind of study guide to being spontaneous and independent. The effort sounds a little like a combination of \u201cThe Analects of Confucius\u201d and Mao\u2019s Little Red Book.If successful, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time American-style management has affected Asian business culture. Japan\u2019s huge postwar economic recovery, with a focus on quality products and productivity, is largely recognized as building on the ideas of W. Edwards Deming, an American engineer and statistician.Mr. Deming\u2019s ideas were readily taken up partly because they fit existing Japanese cultural practices. Turning China into a paradise of creative disruption is probably less likely. But who knows? Maybe on those tour buses is a future Mark Zuckerberg, and he\u2019ll be inspired by the giant \u201cthumbs-up\u201d logo outside Facebook headquarters.Advertisement"}

One photo captures Elena, who lives in public housing in Milan known as the White Houses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a nod to the white asbestos that was used in construction and that has affected residents. Elena lies on a bed in her cramped room, shirtless. Every inch of wall space is covered by clothing accessories. Recently, she suffered from emphysema and lost an eye. Her face is buried in sheets, and Francesco, a friend who visits during her frequent bouts of depression, pulls on a cigarette. In other photos, Ms. Canneri captures the lingering remnants of asbestos production across the country: a swath of contaminated soil in Pisa that has yet to be removed; steam pipelines built with asbestos in Grosseto; and in Alessandria, the decrepit remains of an Eternit factory \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a prosperous fiber cement company that made asbestos-laced roof coverings and pipes before closing in 1986.

{"Headline": "Obama to Dismantle Visitor Registry Before Trump Can Revive It", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byThe registry, created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has not been in use since 2011, so the move is largely symbolic and appeared to be aimed at distancing the departing administration from any effort by the new president to revive the program, known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or Nseers.Asked on Wednesday, in the aftermath of the Berlin attack, whether he still intended to set up a registry for Muslims and impose a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants, Mr. Trump said in Florida, \u201cYou know my plans.\u201d Hours later, a spokesman said Mr. Trump was not reaffirming his earlier calls for a ban on immigration from Muslim countries but was referring to his more recent clarification that he would bar people from countries with a history of Islamist extremism.A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Among the Republican proponents of the registry program is Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. Mr. Kobach, an anti-immigration hard-liner, helped to devise the program while at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration.That information, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the campaign trail, prompted Democratic lawmakers, mayors from cities with large foreign-born populations and some business leaders in Silicon Valley to call on Mr. Obama to undo the legal framework that undergirds the program.That can be done with a rule change. The Department of Homeland Security submitted such a rule change for public posting on Thursday morning, and it is set to be published in the federal register on Friday.\u201cD.H.S. ceased use of Nseers more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security,\u201d Neema Hakim, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. The program is \u201cnot only obsolete\u201d and \u201coutdated,\u201d but diverts personnel and resources from other areas that are seen as more effective, the statement said.Some experts say there is no need for a registry.Officials in the agency have long believed that the program has outlived its usefulness. A number of newer programs, developed in the years since the Nseers system was put into place, capture a vast amount of information that allows customs officers to flag for additional questioning people from certain countries or those with unusual travel itineraries.A 2012 report by the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security said that since 2006, senior officials in the agency had been calling for the termination of the program, and in the report, the inspector general recommended that it be ended. \u201cInformation obtained from fingerprints, flight manifests, travel and identification documents and intelligence sources is more valuable in determining who poses a potential national security risk,\u201d the report said, citing customs and border control officers.An analysis of how a ban could be carried out and how many people would be affected.\u201cLeaving the regulatory structure of the Nseers program in place provides no discernible public benefit,\u201d the report said.The regulations that are being undone date to 1991, at the time of the first gulf war, when immigration authorities began requiring the registration and fingerprinting of certain nonimmigrant travelers entering the United States from Iraq and Kuwait. The authorities removed the requirements for those countries two years later but retained provisions preserving the attorney general\u2019s power to compel the same information from nonimmigrants from specific countries.A decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security, which had taken over the program, said it had stopped registering arrivals from the designated countries and removed all countries from the list. But the move left in place the regulations that allowed for it to be restarted.\u201cNo known terrorism convictions have resulted from the program,\u201d read a joint letter, dated Dec. 1, from more than 50 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat and a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump, said the program was \u201can affront to our core American values of pluralism and equal justice under law.\u201dFacebook, Microsoft, Google and Apple are among several technology companies that have publicly stated that they would not assist the new administration in developing any program that would collect information that could be used by the government to track immigrants from Muslim countries.The technology companies took action after thousands of Silicon Valley engineers signed a pledge saying they stood in solidarity with Muslim Americans and immigrants and would not use their skills for the \u201cnew administration\u2019s proposed data-collection policies.\u201dMr. Hakim, in his statement, said the regulations had long since been replaced by automated systems and programs that were not in place at the start of the registry program \u2014 which required in-person interviews by federal agents and targeted specific countries.The new tools are \u201cfar better equipped to face the evolving landscape of international terrorism,\u201d he said. Those programs include an automated system for collecting and storing biometric data such as fingerprints from nearly all people entering the country.The changes are set to take effect immediately after they are published on Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battle Over Aleppo Is Over, Russia Says, as Evacuation Deal Reached", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byUnder the deal, evacuations were set to begin at 5 a.m. Wednesday, although the departures were delayed and there were reports of renewed shelling. Earlier on Tuesday, fears had mounted as the United Nations said it had received reports that Syrian troops or allied Iraqi militias were gunning down families in apartments and on the streets, with the toll reaching 82 civilians.But then came the deal, and the shelling quieted down. Russia, Turkey and Syrian rebel groups announced that they had agreed to evacuate all of the remaining fighters to rebel-held territory, with civilians free to join them or move to government-held areas, leaving the whole city of Aleppo in government hands.A full evacuation from Aleppo would be the largest success of the government\u2019s starve-or-surrender strategy, bombing and besieging areas out of its control until fighters and residents agree to surrender. It would leave the armed opposition to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in control of just one provincial capital, Idlib \u2014 where rebel fighters from Aleppo will be bused \u2014 as well as stretches of rural territory in northern and southern Syria and several other isolated patches.But the victory leaves Mr. Assad more dependent than ever on Iran and Russia, and so despised by his opponents, including many of Syria\u2019s majority Sunnis, that they might never again accept him as a legitimate ruler. The territory he has reconquered has been won at a devastating cost, and much of the country remains in the hands of his enemies.The battle over Aleppo has been a particularly painful chapter of the war, dividing and largely destroying one of the world\u2019s oldest and most beautiful cities, a World Heritage site, amid mounting human suffering. The eastern, rebel-held half of Aleppo had become unlivable, with rebels unable to stop the government\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, which destroyed entire neighborhoods, let alone deliver a better life. The government-held districts were far less damaged, and daily life there was more normal, but residents there suffered too, from indiscriminate rebel shelling.Tens of thousands of residents \u2014 Russia says at least 100,000, the United Nations puts the number at 37,000 \u2014 left the rebel-held districts as pro-government forces moved in. Thousands more fled to rebel- or Kurdish-held areas. The government said rebels were keeping most people inside by force; some residents said in interviews that fighters had stopped them from leaving, others said they had guided them out.When the agreement was announced on Tuesday, the remaining residents \u2014 who just hours before had been sending what they thought were their last farewells \u2014 suddenly had to reckon with their mixed feelings about a bittersweet and uncertain escape.Now, it seemed, they would survive, and avoid arrest in a country where dissent can be punished by torture. Yet now they would have to leave their city, perhaps forever.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d Bassem Ayoub, a longtime antigovernment activist, posted on Facebook. \u201cMy soul is leaving my body. Aleppo, my life, my life.\u201dHours earlier, he and his family made an excruciating decision. His wife and children, he said, went in search of a route to government-held territory, hoping to fade into crowds of the displaced and not be discovered as the relatives of a man the government considers a terrorist. He stayed behind, unsure when he would see them again, but certain that if he tried to flee, he would be arrested.\u201cSome are crying from happiness, others are sad they will no longer be able to kneel to pray in Aleppo,\u201d said Malek, an activist who hopes to join his pregnant wife in northern Aleppo Province. \u201cI\u2019m sad, as well \u2014 I paid blood for Aleppo, but I can never again set foot here. Tyranny has won.\u201dOthers expressed their bitterness about a revolt that started with protests for political reform but curdled as the government bombarded rebel-held neighborhoods and Islamist extremists rose to power within the insurgency. \u201cThe Islamists and love of power screwed up the revolution,\u201d Zaher al-Zaher, another activist, wrote in a text message. \u201cI lost my house, and my family are away from me. My heart is burning.\u201dAs preparations began for the departures from eastern Aleppo, government supporters celebrated in the streets.Rebels, activists and aid workers in eastern Aleppo said they had been told that civilians and fighters could all leave and travel to rebel-held areas. That satisfied a key demand that both groups have an option to avoid going to government-controlled areas, where dissidents and medical and humanitarian workers working in rebel-held areas have been punished as terrorists.But there were still doubts and fears about whether the way out would be smooth or safe. In previous agreements, like one in Homs in 2014, pro-government militias, angry that fighters they saw as terrorists were allowed to leave alive, have fired on evacuees.Signs of friction emerged early Wednesday in Aleppo. About 1 a.m., four hours before the 5 a.m. departures set out under the agreement, a convoy of vans carrying 70 wounded people, mostly fighters and their families, were filmed pulling out of the enclave. But a short time afterward, residents reported the convoy had been turned back by pro-government Shiite militiamen and told it could depart after 6 a.m.There were concerns that cracks were already emerging in the deal, perhaps over tensions between Mr. Assad\u2019s two main allies, Russia and Iran, which trains and backs pro-government Shiite militias from Iraq and elsewhere.The deal was struck after widespread concern about the fate of civilians, with the United Nations warning of \u201ca complete meltdown of humanity\u201d and protests breaking out at United Nations headquarters in New York and Russian embassies in several cities, including London, Stockholm and Istanbul.Hundreds of civilians have died in the offensive; the full toll is not known because the humanitarian groups that rescued and treated civilians and tracked casualties largely collapsed under fire in recent days.The United Nations said the 82 summary killings were reported in four neighborhoods \u2014 Bustan al-Qasr, al-Fardous, al-Kallaseh and al-Saleheen \u2014 and included at least 11 women and 13 children, some shot in the streets as they tried to escape, said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Mr. Colville cited reports that the world body had received from reliable contacts inside and outside the city.Later on Tuesday, the United Nations Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, revealed new details of what officials knew of the reported killings: The dead had been shot with handguns, but it was not clear who had killed them.Russia categorically denied what the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said were \u201ccredible reports\u201d of atrocities, including executions. Mr. Ban said the United Nations had been unable to verify the reports because the Syrian government had repeatedly denied permission to United Nations staff to monitor the evacuations and aid civilians stuck on the battlefield.Asked if there was concern that Idlib Province, where surrendering rebels and civilians from other cities have been taken, could be \u201cthe next Aleppo,\u201d Mr. de Mistura acknowledged that grim possibility, adding, \u201cWe are working on that.\u201dReporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva, Somini Sengupta from the United Nations, Karam Shoumali from Istanbul, Oleg Matsnev from Moscow and Falih Hassan from Baghdad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Change Their Tone on AT&T and Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byAt a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that was being closely watched for how mega-mergers will be viewed in the coming Trump administration, members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees regulatory agencies that decide on mergers said the deal merited tough scrutiny. The chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner were grilled at the hearing about a range of issues related to the deal.But in a change from previous comments, lawmakers also questioned whether traditional ways of evaluating mergers are growing outdated as Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google become massive media platforms that threaten the television industry. Their tone was more circumspect than those that immediately followed the deal\u2019s announcement, when lawmakers had been more critical.\u201cWe want to ensure that competition thrives in this critical market and we don\u2019t stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who heads the full Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley said Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have transformed the video landscape.Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, said the deal would combine companies that did not directly compete against one another. \u201cThe consumer is benefited from the aggregation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is called capitalism.\u201dOver all, senators were asking \u201chard questions,\u201d said Larry Downes, a professor at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough School of Business. But, he added, \u201cthey seem to be open-minded about the changing nature of competition in the information sector.\u201dAT&T, a telecom giant, and Time Warner, which owns CNN and HBO, had said in October that AT&T would buy Time Warner to create a mobile video powerhouse. The hearing may have implications beyond this deal, with the comments potentially encouraging more acquisitions by companies that have been waiting out the Obama administration, which has rejected several mergers.\u201cThe D.O.J. pays particularly close attention to Senate and House antitrust subcommittees because they oversee the D.O.J.,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company, who added that the committee\u2019s commentary \u201cbears watching for its potential effect on the D.O.J.\u201d Members of the Justice Department attended the hearing.When the deal was announced, days before the presidential election, leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued strong cautionary statements about it. Donald J. Trump, on the campaign trail at the time, said he would block the merger if elected. He has singled out CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner, with particular rancor for its election coverage.As president, Mr. Trump will have no direct power over mergers, but he will greatly influence which ones are approved, depending on whom he picks to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust or the chairman of the F.C.C. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, told CNBC before the hearing that he had not had contact with the Trump transition team.During the hearing, the companies pitched a message that catered to the new administration: a populist promise of lower prices and the potential to build more wireless infrastructure through the merger. While AT&T and Time Warner are powerhouses, they presented themselves as weaker rivals to the cable industry and Silicon Valley tech companies.Mr. Stephenson said in prepared remarks that cable companies dominated the broadband and television market, serving high-speed internet to eight of every 10 American homes that have broadband service. To experiment with new mobile video technologies, he said, AT&T needed to have in-house content to quickly try new streaming services at a lower cost. He added that AT&T had just introduced a streaming service with 100 channels for less than most cable television packages.\u201cIt is only the beginning of what we want to bring to the marketplace to threaten cable\u2019s entrenched and still-dominant market position,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. He said AT&T would give CNN editorial independence if the merger were approved.Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, \u201cIt is not enough to deliver great content.\u201d The companies\u2019 competitors have multiplied, he said.No lawmakers at the hearing said the merger should be blocked, but several expressed skepticism.\u201cI have serious concerns about this transaction,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. The deal \u201cpotentially has serious negative impacts on competition and on consumers.\u201dMark Cuban, an internet entrepreneur and owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, who also spoke at the hearing, said the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. \u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Consumer groups rejected the characterization of AT&T and Time Warner as disadvantaged rivals, saying a combined company would create a powerhouse that all cable providers and networks would have to negotiate with. Streaming providers like Sling TV and Hulu would face a major new competitor, with AT&T\u2019s access to 110 million wireless and satellite subscribers and premium television networks under the same roof, the groups said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Young Men\u2019s African Exodus, Echoes of an Indian Family\u2019s Journey", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byWhat struck me most was the gumption.In a city in Niger called Agadez, at the edge of the Sahara, I met dozens of young men who were risking their lives to make a new life elsewhere, usually with no legal papers to travel to their destinations. There was a mix of harrowing reasons behind their exodus. They were fleeing jihadists or dictators, or they were no longer able to live off the land as their ancestors had done for generations. Most of them had tried to better their prospects closer to home. And many of them recalled the lure of vague Facebook posts from people who had gone abroad before them. Their stories pulled them, one after another, toward a shimmering elsewhere \u2014 even if, in reality, that meant ending up in lawless Libya.I come from a family of migrants. We came with passports and visas. We did not flee war or persecution or hunger or failed harvests. We were middle-class city people for generations. But like the young Africans I wrote about, stories pulled us, too. My father\u2019s older brother was the first in the Sengupta clan to leave Calcutta, once a jewel of the British Empire, where American soldiers brought jazz in the first decades of the 20th century \u2014 and where my uncle felt stultified. He left first for Bombay, the city of movies, and then, on something of a crazy lark, got himself a visa to Canada. He landed in a tiny village in the Canadian prairie, covered in snow for half of the year. He found a job at a textile factory. He brought his wife and daughter \u2014 and then set to work persuading my father. He told a familiar story of the New World. It\u2019s cold but there\u2019s money to be made. We can do it. Come.Among the migrants I interviewed in Agadez were young men filled with a hubris I recognized. Some of them had left home without telling their families. They got on buses and traveled across West Africa, hundreds of miles, not knowing exactly where they were headed nor what they would do. In some places, border guards beat them, or forced them to strip down and took the money they had hidden in their underwear. Some of them slept in bus shelters. A couple of them ended up in detention in Libya and were now on their way back home, defeated. As for those who were still on the journey, some would surely end up dead; nearly 5,000 have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean, most of them Africans.A few would make it to Europe. And who knows, some of them might even persuade a brother to follow.My uncle was an extraordinary hustler. He left Selkirk and settled in Quebec, then Miami, then Los Angeles, where he briefly ran a textile factory of his own. He favored Italian suits, loved betting on horses and, for a while, smoked two packs a day. His idea of family time was to splurge on steak and Scotch on the rocks, and to tell tawdry jokes. We called him our own Tony Soprano. He took risks, as did my father. Both of them won some, and lost a lot. They taught their daughters gumption. But we, the three girls who grew up in the shadow of their hubris, are also far more cautious. We plan for retirement. We take vitamins.I had just returned to Niamey, the capital of Niger, after a week of traveling throughout the country to interview migrants. I had a few more interviews to do, and then I was planning to head home to New York. A call came from my sister. She said my uncle had collapsed at home earlier that day after drinking a cup of tea. He died quickly, seemingly without pain, just days before his 85th birthday. Naturally, we celebrated him at the finest steak house in Beverly Hills. We drank Scotch on the rocks.

Did Robbie apologize for (as Levon had it) breaking up the band and making off with the songwriting royalties, or did he absolve the ex-friend who had slagged him baselessly for three decades, and tell him it made no difference in the end? The web surged with conjecture, and the quarrel showed up on listicles of the Great Feuds of All Time.That was strange. More than any other rock group, the Band made music about people other than themselves: unfaithful servants, Confederate Army vets, lonesome Suzie. They gave other musicians center stage at their own farewell concert. Better for them to sing about some old friends feuding than to feud themselves.Robertson understands this. The deathbed scene doesn\u2019t figure in \u201cTestimony,\u201d but the friendship that made the break with Helm so awful is present at every point in this autobiography.\u201cI felt a hand tap me on the shoulder, reminding me to tread lightly and try to protect my brothers,\u201d he writes of the moment in 1976 when he realized that three of the five Band members were hooked on heroin. \u201cI kept harping to Levon, to Richard and Rick, about finding some kind of sanctuary where we could stop riding so close to the edge.\u201dObviously, Robertson is getting the last word with this long book. And yet his strong point of view is offset by the tenderness he shows, and his stress on his own experience is set within a craftsman\u2019s effort to tell the story whole \u2014 an effort to do justice to their adventures as young men, talented, stylish, successful and lucky, who knew the joy of creative friendship besides.\u201cTestimony\u201d ends where \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d ends, with the Band disbanding, and like the film it doesn\u2019t establish beyond a doubt that the Band had to break up instead of just taking a break. No, this book (another may follow) is about beginnings, not endings: It\u2019s a full-dress drama of initiation, as Robertson comes to know the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll life with the singer Ronnie Hawkins; American roots with Helm (a proud Arkansan); fame and genius through Dylan; artistic fulfillment with the Band; and the perils of adulthood as the group is undone by family life, fights over money, drug abuse and the \u201clifestyles of the crooked and the bent.\u201dAs the book opens Robertson is 16 and \u201cheaded to the holy land of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d having sold his Stratocaster to pay for a train ticket from Toronto to Arkansas. Before long he brings the story back home. He grew up in Ontario, the son of a Mohawk-Cayuga mother and \u2014 as he later learned \u2014 a Jewish father, a cardsharp who was struck and killed by a motorist early in her pregnancy. Once word was out that Robertson\u2019s father was Alex Klegerman, not Jim Robertson, his Jewish uncles Natie and Morrie (\u201cproducts of Toronto\u2019s Jewish underworld\u201d) decided to look out for him.He had quit school to join the Hawks, backing Hawkins, who had come north from Arkansas with the young drummer Levon Helm to work Canada\u2019s club circuit. The Hawks took on musicians who would form the Band \u2014 the bassist Rick Danko, the pianist Richard Manuel, the organist and all-around virtuoso Garth Hudson \u2014 and gained a reputation as the best R&B band north of Memphis, and the hardest-working. The Beatles were playing the club circuit in Hamburg then, and Malcolm Gladwell recently made the episode evidence for his \u201c10,000-hour rule\u201d of achievement \u2014 but Gladwell, proud product of Ontario, could just as well have used the Hawks. Weed, women, Cadillacs; a drug bust; nights hearing Muddy, Otis and Aretha: The Hawks spent 10,000 hours enjoying the hell out of life, too.Helm told many of those stories in his 1993 autobiography, \u201cThis Wheel\u2019s on Fire.\u201d Yet coming a quarter-century later, Robertson\u2019s telling seems more vivid, not less so. One reason is that Robertson \u2014 like his card-counting father \u2014 has a strong memory and a gift for recalling, or providing, dialogue, whole scenes of it:\u201c\u200a\u2018Go on, sit in it,\u2019 offered Levon. \u2018It still has that new-car smell.\u2019\u201c\u200a\u2018No, if I sit in it, I\u2019m gonna wanna keep it,\u2019 said Bertram. \u2018And then I\u2019d have to kill you.\u2019\u200a\u201dAnother is that Robertson, the Band\u2019s main writer, wasn\u2019t one of their main singers. Levon\u2019s book was related in the country-fried voice familiar from his vocals. Robertson\u2019s book is written with a full range of literary devices. His buddy Levon\u2019s pride, and its cousins anger and spite, are heard through all that dialogue: The voice comes through loud and clear.When Bob Dylan enters the story, Robbie\u2019s account parts sharply from Levon\u2019s. As Levon told it, Dylan hired Robbie as a guitarist, Robbie proposed Levon as the drummer and Levon confronted Dylan\u2019s manager and insisted, \u201cTake us all, or don\u2019t take anybody.\u201d As Robbie tells it, he was the one who urged Dylan to hire the whole band. \u201c\u200a\u2018It\u2019s a kind of all-or-nothing situation,\u2019 I told Bob.\u201dIt\u2019s a difference of perspective that would be felt all down the line of the band\u2019s subsequent history. As he recounts the making of \u201cThe Basement Tapes\u201d and the Band\u2019s classic first two albums, Robertson presents himself as a musician who knows he\u2019s lucky to belong to this group of musicians, and knows to fit his own gifts to theirs. \u201cI began singing the chorus to \u2018The Weight\u2019 over and over to the guys, trying to convey the staggered vocal idea I had. \u2018Levon, you go \u201caaand,\u201d then Rick, \u201caaand,\u201d then Richard on top, \u201caaand.\u201d\u200a\u2019\u200a\u201dIt was the sound of a group of people doing together what they couldn\u2019t do by themselves. But it was hard to apportion credit for it, and when attention went to Robertson the others felt violated. Robertson, for his part, felt let down as their contributions slackened because of drug use. He worked out his frustrations in songs written for them: \u201c\u200a\u2018The Shape I\u2019m In\u2019 for Richard to sing, \u2018Stage Fright\u2019 for Rick and \u2018The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\u2019 for Levon \u2014 all with undertones of madness and self-destruction.\u201dRobertson identifies the end in 1976 with the end of an era, as Jimmy Carter put Richard Nixon in the rearview mirror. But for the most part he keeps clear of big ideas and period clich\u00e9s. Instead, he offers his story \u2014 his side of the story \u2014 in scene after scene. Cavorting with Edie Sedgwick at the Chelsea Hotel; previewing the album \u201cThe Band\u201d for George Harrison; jetting to Paris with David Geffen and Joni Mitchell (and his wife, Dominique): There\u2019s so much sound and color here that the self-exculpating scenes fit right in, vivid and convincing. In the final moments of preparation for \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d Robertson, \u201cdrained from pushing forward with the help of drugs instead of food and sleep,\u201d meets Dominique at their hotel suite: \u201c\u200a\u2018Wait a second, you look so pale.\u2019 She took a brush out of her purse and said, \u2018Close your eyes.\u2019 She swished the brush over my cheeks and a bit around my face.\u201d A lovely conjugal moment, yes \u2014 and a rebuttal to Levon, who claimed that Robbie showed up at the Winterland with a \u201cheavily made-up face and expensive haircut\u201d so as to upstage the others.\u201cTestimony\u201d is high-spirited, hugely enjoyable and generous from start to finish. Just as the Band, which came late to \u201960s rock (\u201cMusic From Big Pink\u201d was released in July 1968), learned from their peers who peaked earlier, so Robertson seems to have kept an eye on his friends Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton so as to make his autobiography a late, great pendant to theirs.Paul Elie is the author, most recently, of \u201cReinventing Bach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump and his daughter Ivanka met with former Vice President Al Gore on Monday to discuss human-caused climate change. And a fake-news believer finds the truth at a pizza parlor. Al Gore thought he would be bending the ear of the adviser Mr. Trump trusts most, his daughter Ivanka.\u201cI had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect,\u201d Mr. Gore, the former vice president, told reporters at Trump Tower. \u201cIt was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued.\u201dHundreds of scientists are also telling Mr. Trump in a new letter that climate change is real and needs to be addressed:\u201cWe urge you to decide if you want your presidency to be defined by denial and disaster, or acceptance and action,\u201d says the new letter, which will be sent on Tuesday and has already been signed by 700 scientists and academics from related disciplines. The letter lists six steps the president-elect can take to help protect the nation\u2019s \u201ceconomy, national security, and public health and safety.\u201dIt must have felt familiar to Mr. Gore, confronting a president-elect who had just lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College.On Tuesday, House Democrats will convene a forum on the \u201cElectoral College and the Future of American Democracy.\u201d No word on whether they will be picking up the tab to move Californians to Florida and Ohio.The electoral recriminations keep rolling in. A former Breitbart News reporter claimed last night on Facebook that he planted Clinton hecklers at her rallies, and has since deleted the post.After the suspect, Edgar M. Welch, \u201cfound no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,\u201d he surrendered peacefully, the documents said.The truth now known, perhaps Mr. Welch could tell the son of the president-elect\u2019s pick for national security adviser, who said on Twitter:Also, if he had kept his assault rifle stashed, the gunman could have enjoyed a pizza and a beer, but we Washingtonians understand the wait for a ping-pong table can be pretty long.The House majority leader said a Republican-led Congress would not support the president-elect\u2019s vow to hit companies that move overseas with a hefty tariff on goods sent back to the United States.And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hinted strongly that he wouldn\u2019t go along either.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into some kind of trade war,\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, said in response to vehement threats by Mr. Trump over the weekend.Mr. Ryan echoed Mr. McCarthy\u2019s view that an overhaul of the corporate tax code would better keep jobs in the United States than a punitive tariff on companies that send work abroad.\u201cI think we can get at the goal here, which is keep American businesses American, build things in America and sell them overseas. That can be properly addressed in comprehensive tax reform,\u201d the speaker told a Wisconsin reporter.In a storm of Twitter posts over the weekend, the president-elect had been uncompromising on the proposal.An umbrella organization of Jewish groups is holding a Hanukkah party at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, and one of its member groups is not too happy about it.\u201cIn the years to come, Jews in America are going to be regularly tested to make the right choices, and this is clearly not one of them,\u201d wrote Peter Pepper and Ann Toback, the president and executive director of the Workmen\u2019s Circle, in a letter to Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoenlein said that the venue choice had been made by the partner for the party, the Azerbaijani Embassy, and that it was one of the few places that would hold a kosher reception on short notice.\u201cThere\u2019s no other significance to it,\u201d Mr. Hoenlein said, adding that Mr. Trump is not yet president, \u201cso there\u2019s no conflict.\u201dMr. Trump has a message to the news media: Cover him the way he wants or he\u2019ll just have to keep tweeting \u2014 regardless of the consequences.The next dates are out:\u25a0 Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N.C., at 7 p.m. Tuesday\u25a0 Hy-Vee Hall in Des Moines at 7 p.m. Central time Thursday.\u25a0 DeltaPlex Arena in Grand Rapids, Mich., at 7 p.m. FridayRetired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis may have led the 1st Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq and later oversaw the campaign for Falluja, but he now thinks the Iraq War was a mistake.Perhaps not coincidentally, Mr. Trump \u2014 his boss, should he be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 had a similar change of views on the war, though the president-elect has famously insisted he always opposed the invasion.Several groups who favor limiting immigration are voicing their opposition to Representative Michael McCaul as a potential secretary of homeland security, saying the Texas Republican has been weak on border security.Mr. McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been a frequent critic of what he says is the Obama administration\u2019s failure to adequately combat the Islamic State.But groups like the Center for Immigration Studies say Mr. McCaul\u2019s efforts on border security and immigration have been weak and counterproductive.\u201cHe\u2019s been the chairman of this critical committee and never tried to push through legislation that adequately addresses border security, immigration and homeland security,\u201d said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the center.The real aim may be less about opposing Mr. McCaul than opening a lane for the group\u2019s homeland security chief of choice: Mr. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state.The Federation for American Immigration Reform did not directly oppose Mr. McCaul but said the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security needed to be someone who would implement real border and immigration security.\u201cIf Representative McCaul is chosen to head D.H.S., he will need to take a much more expansive view of border and immigration enforcement than he has in the past,\u201d said Dan Stein, the president of the federation.Advertisement"}

Pile the presents to the sky, by all means.Trump-hating grown-ups may want to throw every last gift-budget dollar into the Planned Parenthood bucket. If that\u2019s your thing, do it.But let this column be an additional seasonal reminder that generosity is a trait that nearly all of us share and hope to imprint on the children and teenagers in our orbit. So if you\u2019re so inclined, commit yourself to doing at least one thing before the end of the year to bring the gift of giving to young people.Here are six ideas to get you started:So tell your family history to your children, grandchildren, nieces or students. Update it each year with new examples of others who helped you out along the way. Kids love hearing these stories, and it helps them understand why you feel moved to support the causes you do.But was there anything missing, we wondered? There was, according to our 8-year-old, who made the case for donating to a scholarship fund at her camp.You don\u2019t have to lead with the total dollar amounts or disclose them at all. Instead, drop 100 beans on the table, divide them into piles and then label each pile, noting that for every $100 you give away, this is how you divide it up.As part of the school\u2019s Judaic Studies curriculum, students pair off, establish an area of interest, find three local organizations that help in that area and then present one of them to classmates for further evaluation. Criteria for the culling include the importance of the problem, proof of the organization\u2019s effectiveness and how big of an impact the students\u2019 gift could make given the size of the organization.Each one is ripe material for extended conversation, which is exactly the point. Students can change their minds about their allocation votes at least once before the day comes to dole out as much as $5,000 per group. \u201cEvery year at the culminating event, there are parents crying,\u201d said Jody Bloom, who teaches the Judaic Studies class. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of the reason that they send their kids to the school in the first place.\u201dIn Manhattan, Sara Shapiro-Plevan, a consultant, is about to start a giving circle just for boys. She was plotting against the reality that by the time middle school rolls around, some children want nothing to do with members of the opposite sex, while others want everything to do with them. Either way, she figured, it would work better if it was just her sixth grader and his male friends. \u201cIt\u2019s an easier way to have what might be a challenging conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to do something his mom was asking him to do.\u201dFor many years, Jen Bokoff, a Brooklyn resident who works in philanthropy, has done a one-night-only circle with her family each Hanukkah. She and her relatives each bring $10, regardless of age, and then talk for a bit about an organization they favor. Everyone\u2019s names go into a hat, someone picks and then that person\u2019s organization gets all the money.So how best for a family to share in a way that will not subtly shame some other adult having a more materialistic holiday?Treasure is the money. Time and talent are about volunteering, which children should certainly do too in their areas of interest.As for the ties, that\u2019s about your network \u2014 and for middle- and high-school-age children, their most powerful networks may be digital ones. \u201cThey can use those platforms to share causes they care about,\u201d Ms. Bokoff said. \u201cAnd if they do it, their friends are more likely to as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019m Here to Help,\u2019 Trump Tells Tech Executives at Meeting", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe meeting between President-elect Donald J. Trump and the nation\u2019s tech elite was hyped as something out of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of \u201cDancing With the Silicon Valley Stars.\u201d\u201cThis is a truly amazing group of people,\u201d the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The gathering included Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Elon Musk of Tesla; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, among others. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you folks do well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He kept going in that vein. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like you in the world,\u201d he enthused. \u201cIn the world! There\u2019s nobody like the people in this room.\u201d Anything that the government \u201ccan do to help this go along,\u201d he made clear, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be there for you.\u201dAnd that was just in the first few minutes. The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen.Even after the press was ushered out, the meeting continued its genial way. Among the topics discussed, according to several corporate executives and a transition official briefed on the meeting, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, were vocational education and the need for more of it, the promise and peril of trade with China and immigration (Mr. Trump wants \u201csmart and talented people here\u201d). The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste.There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you the hundreds of calls we\u2019ve had asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed.To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would \u2014 by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait.Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower\u2019s holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up.Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d\u201cI shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech \u2014 agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing \u2014 everywhere,\u201d he said.The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump\u2019s values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality.Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.)Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect\u2019s medium of choice for communication, was not invited.In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear.A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin.Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties.Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration.\u201cWe have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,\u201d he said.More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too.In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent.One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration.Another reason: less tech spending by the government. \u201cThere are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,\u201d said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst.As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs,\u201d the analyst said.So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": " This is quite a sizable project. What was the goal? We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know if climate refugees or migrants existed yet or if this was something that was still far afield. We reached out to reporters in our foreign bureaus all over the world and asked them to start to look into this topic and see if there were climate-based migrations or relocations happening right now. After a month or two of preliminary reporting, we decided that there were enough stories to justify a concerted effort to look at climate refugees all over the world.  How did you choose your visual approach? We made the decision to continue the visual look and feel of the initial two stories that I had done the previous year in Greenland and the Marshall Islands. Why did you choose a drone as your main tool? A lot of the iconography that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen depicting climate change has been very similar. I think many people feel oversaturated with images of glaciers calving into the ocean and polar bears on a piece of ice floating in the sea. Using a drone definitely created a sort of visual eye candy that we thought would make people want to explore articles that were covering complex themes through nuanced writing. And we thought it would be a good way to pique the reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s curiosity in order to scroll down and engage. Drones have a unique ability to put people into places that they cannot usually be. They also allow us to define a reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement through a place and build a context before you reveal more of the story. Few other forms of photography and videography can achieve this, and I felt it was an integral way to get our readers to feel what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to be in these places.People on the edges of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vast seas of sand are being displaced by climate change. What are the challenges of using drones, both practically and compositionally? Many countries have not yet defined their laws related to drones, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we wanted to work on this series as quickly as possible. In fact, over the course of this year, the laws in the United States changed, and now there is a sanctioned test so that media professionals and others who want to be able to fly drones commercially can get certified to fly. I took the test the first day it was offered, and now I am an F.A.A.-certified drone pilot. So if the Louisiana story were happening now, I would be able to fly a drone for that story.For the parts of this series that took place in other countries, we had to engage our legal department to analyze the laws that were on the books to make sure that we were within our rights, and the law, to fly drones in those locations. Often there were no specific laws, and in those cases we decided to follow F.A.A. guidelines. The disappearance of Lake Poop\u00c3\u00b3 has not only destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of fishing families, but also added to a new category of climate refugees.In Alaska, I had to deal with freezing cold weather and intense winds. The cold makes your batteries deplete much more rapidly, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re often far from where you can recharge, so you have to budget your time.I prefer to control all aspects of the drone shoots: both the flying and the camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s composition. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much more involved process, I find that it enables me to more easily react and adapt to things happening in front of me. I try to always work with a visual observer to help make sure that I\u2019m not getting too close to trees, water or other obstacles while flying. But trying to concentrate on composition while also keeping your flight smooth takes a lot of practice and concentration. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use automated flight controls or pre-defined flight paths, as I like to be able to speed up, slow down or change direction if something interesting is happening outside of where I set the drone to fly. How did you choose what to photograph on the ground?  Usually for the first few days, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to figure out the story and make pictures that are exploratory in nature. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that these dutiful photos don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually make the final edit. But I feel I benefit from that process, as it helps me learn and adapt to what the story is going to be.Often in our profession, we arrive thinking we know what the reporter is going to be writing about, or we arrive after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done much of their research and reporting. But the process on this series was definitely a much more integrated form of journalism, where the visual reporting itself contributed to the stories.  Had you been to China before?  You mentioned that the drone helped you look at the issue differently so people could see it differently. How do you make images on the ground that are in some way distinctive or insightful? In this series, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused less on causation and more on the impact that environmental changes are having on people\u2019s lives, their cultures and their ultimate decision to stay or move. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we were very careful about, because climate science is always developing, so we are constantly learning. And unless detailed studies are done on each of these locations, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only able to really witness impacts. This is an example of a more subtle image that I think you can only really make after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in a town or village for a while to learn its context. I was fortunate to be given a week or two for each assignment, so I was able to learn a bit before I had to start taking pictures.  Why are you so interested in climate change?  Growing up, I was lucky to have parents who believed in the importance of travel to explore the natural and cultural beauty within our country and abroad. One of the reasons I became a photographer was to continue that exploration. The more I travel, the more I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed changes to our natural world and the ripple effect of those on people and cultures. It feels to me like things are beginning to accelerate, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also possible that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just becoming more tuned in to what to look for. Regardless, our climate defines so much about who we are that I feel we must learn from it as it changes.    Even now, your conception of a good time is backpacking for a week.  My idea of a great time is a backpacking in the Sierra Nevada in California and not seeing anyone for 10 days. Kings Canyon is one of my favorite parks. When I take breaks from work, I like to get away from technology and from the burden of connectivity. So nature is something that is very special to me. And as it changes, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just influence the trees, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just influence the water, but there are many other repercussions. The eight locations we focused on this year showed me some of the ways our world is changing. These are on a micro scale right now, but we need to think about what happens when rising seas affect a place like Miami. Maybe we can use some of the lessons that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re learning in these eight places to help us better prepare when that becomes our reality. "}

That\u2019s not news, of course. But his target was slightly unusual. He criticized Chuck Jones, a union leader in Indiana who represents workers at the Carrier air-conditioning plant where Trump intervened to save people\u2019s jobs. Jones had criticized some aspects of the deal, and Trump didn\u2019t like it, so he accused Jones of doing a \u201cterrible job representing workers.\u201dSome have argued that by going after individuals, Trump is violating Twitter\u2019s terms of service. Do you think they can do anything about Trump\u2019s tweets?Do I think Twitter will actually pull the trigger on some sort of account suspension? Doubtful, unless something drastic and terrible happens. And let\u2019s pray that isn\u2019t the case.And do I think Facebook will ever deep-six Trump from the platform? Not a snowball\u2019s chance in heck. They\u2019re already scared about ticking off Republicans over there after the monthslong saga that was Trending Topics-gate.The whole episode is just another reminder that Facebook and its directors do not care one bit about how shareholders believe Facebook should be run. For many people, that\u2019s a good corporate governance philosophy. But I say quit the charade and just own up to it.There are a few ways to look at this. One, you heartily LOL, like I did, when you see a company literally publish a running chronicle on how and why it has messed things up with its ad tech and analytics. It\u2019s worrisome that some of these things haven\u2019t been worked out entirely, and that billions of dollars are being spent on what seems to be imperfect measurement and definitions on what the biggest marketers in the world are paying for.The flip side of that coin, however, is that Facebook is aiming for transparency around an imperfect system in continuous development, something that not all companies would necessarily do. I do wonder what something like this would have looked like were Google to have done it as it developed and fine-tuned AdWords, the company\u2019s goose that keeps laying golden eggs, even years later.All of that said, one of the things I keep hearing from marketers who have followed this is pretty important: If your return on investment is proven, then who cares if some of the metrics are off by a bit? It seems a bit oversimplified, but I can take the point.And really, there\u2019s no actual recourse for most smaller advertisers who have no choice but to keep buying Facebook ads. Facebook and Google are the only games in town \u2014 for now, at least.Advertisement"}

It was far from magical. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe found his house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Suchy recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was really, really sad. It had been converted into a chicken coop. We found almost no traces of anyone that he had known from before. The places that he remembered from his youth were almost unrecognizable to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFortunately, an ethnographer at a local museum recommended they contact Dido Vasyl Potjak, a man living in Kryvorivnya, a couple of hours\u2019 drive away. He was born in the same year as her father, 1911, and the two men hit it off. He became a dear friend and her connection to a village that she has now documented for nearly 25 years.

Ms. Suchy gathered more than a hundred carolers in the village square and made a group portrait that became her introduction to the community. For several years, those villagers saw her hauling around her heavy 8\u00d710 camera, and she feels the locals respected her work ethic, which also helped enmesh her in the community.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey could relate to that because it was physical labor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of them toil a lot on land which is not productive, with a short growing season.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Suchy spent nearly a decade away from the project, which created the time jumps that allow for her jarring diptychs. We see the dissident Eudosia Sorochan as she grows from old to ancient.

Twenty years later, she is in the same spot, now wearing a revealing bikini with little to hide.Artists, writers and creative types have long been drawn to Kryvorivnya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural beauty, folkloric traditions and remote location. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a place of healing, she said, and volunteers from the community have invited wounded soldiers from the war in Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s east to come convalesce in the village.

By analyzing patterns of reading and sharing, the company said, it might be able to penalize articles that are shared at especially low rates by those who read them \u2014 a signal of dissatisfaction. Finally, it said, it would try to put economic pressure on bad actors in three ways: by banning disputed stories from its advertising ecosystem; by making it harder to impersonate credible sites on the platform; and, crucially, by penalizing websites that are loaded with too many ads.Facebook\u2019s political news ecosystem during the 2016 election was vast and varied. There was, of course, content created by outside news media that was shared by users, but there were also reams of content \u2014 posts, images, videos \u2014 created on Facebook-only pages, and still more media created by politicians themselves. During the election, it was apparent to almost anyone with an account that Facebook was teeming with political content, much of it extremely partisan or pitched, its sourcing sometimes obvious, other times obscured, and often simply beside the point \u2014 memes or rants or theories that spoke for themselves.Facebook seems to have zeroed in on only one component of this ecosystem \u2014 outside websites \u2014 and within it, narrow types of bad actors.

Accordingly, Facebook\u2019s anti-hoax measures seek to regulate these sites by punishing them not just for what they do on Facebook, but for what they do outside of it.\u201cWe\u2019ve found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated,\u201d Mosseri wrote. \u201cSpammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organizations and posting hoaxes that get people to visit to their sites, which are often mostly ads.\u201d The proposed solution: \u201cAnalyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary.\u201dIn this context, this \u201cfake news\u201d problem reads less as a distinct new phenomenon than as a flaring symptom of an older, more existential anxiety that Facebook has been grappling with for years: its continued (albeit diminishing) dependence on the same outside web that it, and other platforms, have begun to replace. Facebook\u2019s plan for \u201cfake news\u201d is no doubt intended to curb certain types of misinformation. But it\u2019s also a continuation of the company\u2019s bigger and more consequential project \u2014 to capture the experiences of the web it wants and from which it can profit, but to insulate itself from the parts that it doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t. This may help solve a problem within the ecosystem of outside publishers \u2014 an ecosystem that, in the distribution machinery of Facebook, is becoming redundant, and perhaps even obsolete.To understand what such ambition looks like in practice, consider Facebook\u2019s history. It started as an inward-facing website, closed off from both the web around it and the general public. It was a place to connect with other people, and where content was created primarily by other users: photos, wall posts, messages. This system quickly grew larger and more complex, leading to the creation, in 2006, of the news feed \u2014 a single location in which users could find updates from all of their Facebook friends, in roughly reverse-chronological order.Facebook, for its part, paid close attention to the sorts of external content people were sharing on its platform and to the techniques used by websites to get an edge. It adapted continually. It provided greater video functionality, reducing the need to link to outside videos or embed them from YouTube. As people began posting more news, it created previews for links, with larger images and headlines and longer summaries; eventually, it created Instant Articles, allowing certain publishers (including The Times) to publish stories natively in Facebook. At the same time, it routinely sought to penalize sites it judged to be using the platform in bad faith, taking aim at \u201cclickbait,\u201d an older cousin of \u201cfake news,\u201d with a series of design and algorithm updates. As Facebook\u2019s influence over online media became unavoidably obvious, its broad approach to users and the web became clearer: If the network became a popular venue for a certain sort of content or behavior, the company generally and reasonably tried to make that behavior easier or that content more accessible. This tended to mean, however, bringing it in-house.To Facebook, the problem with \u201cfake news\u201d is not just the obvious damage to the discourse, but also with the harm it inflicts upon the platform. People sharing hoax stories were, presumably, happy enough with they were seeing. But the people who would then encounter those stories in their feeds were subjected to a less positive experience. They were sent outside the platform to a website where they realized they were being deceived, or where they were exposed to ads or something that felt like spam, or where they were persuaded to share something that might later make them look like a rube. These users might rightly associate these experiences not just with their friends on the platform, or with the sites peddling the bogus stories but also with the platform itself. This created, finally, an obvious issue for a company built on attention, advertising and the promotion of outside brands. From the platform\u2019s perspective, \u201cfake news\u201d is essentially a user-experience problem resulting from a lingering design issue \u2014 akin to slow-loading news websites that feature auto-playing videos and obtrusive ads.Increasingly, legitimacy within Facebook\u2019s ecosystem is conferred according to a participant\u2019s relationship to the platform\u2019s design. A verified user telling a lie, be it a friend from high school or the president elect, isn\u2019t breaking the rules; he is, as his checkmark suggests, who he represents himself to be. A post making false claims about a product is Facebook\u2019s problem only if that post is labeled an ad. A user video promoting a conspiracy theory becomes a problem only when it leads to the violation of community guidelines against, for example, user harassment. Facebook contains a lot more than just news, including a great deal of content that is newslike, partisan, widely shared and often misleading. Content that has been, and will be, immune from current \u201cfake news\u201d critiques and crackdowns, because it never had the opportunity to declare itself news in the first place. To publish lies as \u201cnews\u201d is to break a promise; to publish lies as \u201ccontent\u201d is not.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Searching the World for a Cure, a Mother Seeks Normalcy", "Date": "2016-12-21", "News": "Supported byThe Neediest Cases FundWhen a Russian oncologist called her 3-year-old daughter\u2019s brain tumor \u201cuntreatable,\u201d Elena Romanova researched alternatives through the night.A young mother of three, Ms. Romanova had spent a year and a half in a Moscow hospital as her daughter Ksenia Subbotina went through radiation, chemotherapy and two brain operations. Despite all of the treatment, the cancer had spread to her spine, and the doctor said Ms. Romanova should prepare end-of-life care for Ksenia.\u201cI knew there was no cure in Russia,\u201d Ms. Romanova said. \u201cSo the question was where to go next.\u201dThat July night in 2012 she emailed doctors around the world about additional treatments. A doctor in London offered a screening for $32,000 that included an M.R.I. and a pathology analysis to determine the next steps.Ms. Romanova did not have that much money. The Russian government had paid for hospital stays and general medication during Ksenia\u2019s years there, but in order to secure better care, the family had slipped money to doctors and nurses, spending all of their meager savings.Her husband worked as a furniture builder to help pay expenses and to care for Ms. Romanova\u2019s other children. She said they would have sold their car but needed it to get to the hospital.Rusfond provided money for six cycles of aggressive chemotherapy and two cycles of targeted chemotherapy in London. During that time, Ms. Romanova became fluent in English by reading medical reports and discussing treatments with British doctors.Eventually doctors in London suggested that they go to a proton therapy center in Prague for additional treatment. Since the aid covered only the treatments in London, she started a fund-raising website and Facebook page, hosted dinners to raise money and sold dried fruits on the street. In total, she said she paid another $180,000 for treatments abroad.\u201cWe went where there was hope,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to keep fighting. If we fought long enough, maybe one day, they\u2019d find something that worked.\u201dThe fight continued into a new year, 2014, and in a new city, Houston. That January, Ksenia received a targeted chemotherapy treatment that caused excessive internal bleeding. It seemed she would not survive, until a doctor \u2014 \u201cI will never forget his hands,\u201d Ms. Romanova said \u2014 stopped the bleeding and removed part of the tumor. Her daughter healed, but could not continue the risky therapy.Ms. Romanova\u2019s voice cracked recalling Ksenia\u2019s final weeks, holding her daughter\u2019s hand and praying for a miracle that did not come. She died on July 7, 2014.Unable to bear the thought of cremating her body to take her back to Russia, the family buried Ksenia in a cemetery in Rockland County, New York. They returned to Moscow in August, and Ms. Romanova said she sank into depression and had suicidal thoughts.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept waiting for her to come back. I knew I had to live for my other kids. But without my youngest, every day was not right.\u201dJust two months after Ksenia\u2019s death, her oldest daughter, Anna, then 13, lost feeling on her left side. Doctors in Russia said she had multiple sclerosis, but Ms. Romanova had doubts. She sent Anna\u2019s medical records to friends in the United States, who shared them with doctors. Those doctors, she said, also questioned the diagnosis.Ms. Romanova took her children to Long Island on tourist visas in October 2014 for Anna to get treatment, and she improved. Her doctors, Ms. Romanova said, told her the ailments were most likely stress-related.On a cold December night inside the family\u2019s dimly lit Brooklyn apartment, Ms. Romanova, 34, spoke in soft tones about the daughter she lost. Splayed at her feet, her son, Artem, 11, shuttled a silver marble across the floor, sending the cat flying. Anna, now 15, huddled protectively over her mother as she recounted the story.\u201cIn New York, I felt closer to her,\u201d Ms. Romanova said of Ksenia.Now, she hopes to make the city her permanent home. She applied for political asylum in March 2015, outlining the persecution she faced living as a practicing Baptist in Russia. She is still waiting for an interview for asylum.She works as a billing assistant at a medical office, earning $1,400 a month. Unable to meet her family\u2019s living expenses and $1,200-per-month rent, she took a second job in September as a home attendant, earning an extra $900 a month. She receives no public assistance, and her pending immigration status excludes her from receiving food stamps. She said that her marriage fell apart shortly after Ksenia\u2019s death, and that she has no family in the United States to whom she could ask for support.Taped to the kitchen wall is a reminder to her children: \u201cThe most important thing in life is to be brave and follow your heart and intuition.\u201d She said she wanted Artem to excel in math and chess and Anna in singing and musical composition.As for herself, \u201cI want to start over again,\u201d Ms. Romanova said. \u201cI just want to get a normal job and live a normal life with my kids.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oakland Fire: Delving Into What Happened, and Why", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byLess than one week after a blaze ripped through a ramshackle warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, this shocked city is grappling with an array of questions about what precisely happened, many of them deeply troubling.To try to answer them, The New York Times is deploying a team of journalists across Oakland as part of an investigative reporting effort.We would typically reveal our findings in an article published at the end of our reporting.This time, though, we are doing something different: We are going to share regular updates on what we uncover as we do our reporting.We\u2019ll tell you about the interviews that our journalists conduct, the documents we obtain and what we learn as we learn it \u2014 as part of our effort to piece this story together.\u2022 Could the city have done more to prevent the Ghost Ship fire? What did the city know about the violations at the warehouse? Did it follow up on citations?\u2022 What was the cause of the blaze?\u2022 What more can be learned about the owner and tenant-manager? Who is ultimately responsible?\u2022 Should this tragedy result in more crackdowns on illegal housing in Oakland?\u2022 Who are the people living in spaces like the Ghost Ship?\u2022 Are there other places like it in Oakland, and why do people choose to live there?\u2022 What does this story tell us about gentrification in the city?\u2022 What does the fire mean for Oakland?Yamiche Alcindor is on the team of Times reporters looking into the aftermath of the fire.On Wednesday, I set off to find out more about Oakland\u2019s fire inspection codes, which have become a major focus since the fire.Topping the list of people to contact was Zac Unger, vice president of Local 55, the Oakland firefighters union, who had told several news outlets that the Fire Department had suffered from mismanagement. After playing phone tag for part of the morning, Mr. Unger spoke with me for about half an hour and laid out what he said were years of problems in the department.Specifically, Mr. Unger said he had complained regularly to city officials, telling them that the city does not have enough fire inspectors and that its Fire Department lacks proper resources. Mr. Unger also said he had openly criticized Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed for going several years without having a fire marshal to oversee whether the city was inspecting the proper number of buildings and potentially hazardous spaces.\u201cI said specifically the mismanagement of the Fire Department is going to lead to a tragedy and you need to do something about it now, and I am heartbroken to have been proven right and to have all of these people dead,\u201d Mr. Unger said.Still, it is too early to say if city officials could have done more to prevent the fire. Officials have not said how many times fire inspectors visited the Ghost Ship to check for fire hazards, or if city code inspectors ever flagged the building as being used for something other than its zoned purpose. (I am awaiting a response from the fire chief and other city officials.)Sgt. Barry Donelan, the president of the Oakland Police Officers\u2019 Association, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to expect police officers responding to emergencies to also determine if the buildings they enter have dangerous living conditions. \u201cMy guys are trying to get out there and protect our community,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to do their duties. But you can\u2019t be effective in arrests and imposing building codes. That\u2019s ludicrous.\u201dHe added that in their reports, officers focus on crimes like robberies or domestic violence, and don\u2019t scour residences for code violations. He said he wasn\u2019t sure how many times officers had visited the Ghost Ship.The warehouse was run by a married couple, Derick Ion Almena \u2014 also known as Derick Ion \u2014 and Micah Allison, whom residents described as the \u201cmaster tenants\u201d who rented the building and sublet parts of it to others.According to its records, Oakland\u2019s Planning and Building Department has not had an inspector inside the Ghost Ship in the last 30 years, Darin Ranelletti, the department\u2019s interim director, said Wednesday. \u201cThat means that we had no applications for permits in the last 30 years and there were no violations that were submitted for interior work within the main building attributed to that street address,\u201d he said.Thomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief of The Times.No one answered the door at a building known as the Deathtrap, another warehouse inhabited by artists in West Oakland. Residents at many such collectives operating in the gray areas of the law are now very concerned about a crackdown.While I was taking stock of this one-story building, which sits in a neighborhood of vacant lots, industrial workshops and a billboard announcing plans for a \u201cluxury\u201d development, a middle-aged man pulled up in a battered black vehicle that resembled an El Camino.As soon as I announced that I was a reporter, he told me residents were planning to issue a statement soon. It\u2019s a sign of how badgered by the media Oakland artists have been in recent days that an art collective known as the Deathtrap is pushing out a news release.\u201cThere are definitely concerns that this will lead to evictions,\u201d said the man, a Deathtrap resident, refusing to give me his name. \u201cEveryone is tense.\u201dBut what about the safety of the people who live in these structures?\u201cThe warehouse scene in Oakland is very diverse,\u201d he said. \u201cTo judge us all by the same standard would be a mistake.\u201dOakland has always attracted artists, musicians and other performers to its postindustrial grittiness and sprawling landscape of warehouses. In recent years, the city has become even more of an artistic hub as economic refugees have crossed the Bay Bridge from unaffordable San Francisco.The Ghost Ship fire, heart-wrenching for its loss of life, is sending panic through the art community here because of fears that such spaces could be shut down.Matt Hummel, a longtime member of Oakland\u2019s artistic scene who at one point ran for City Council, spoke about these fears among artist collectives that, before the fire, openly advertised their locations and parties.\u201cEveryone is scrubbing their Facebook feeds, going to Google and saying, \u2018This place never existed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey are erasing everything.\u201dArtists, Mr. Hummel said, are communicating by Signal, an encrypted messaging system.While I was typing up this note in the back of my car, which was parked on Fruitvale Avenue, just a few steps from site of the Ghost Ship fire, Libby Schaaf, the Oakland mayor, called.Should artists be worried?\u201cWe have gone through an immense tragedy,\u201d Ms. Schaaf replied, \u201cbut it would be another tragedy if we did not learn lessons from this and improve every system we have to improve the safety of our residents.\u201dIn cracking down on fire standards, is there a risk of destroying the artistic community that the city wants to preserve?\u201cI am born and raised in Oakland,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what a personal commitment I have to preserving and lifting up that unique and creative energy that makes Oakland Oakland.\u201dThere will be no \u201cwitch hunts,\u201d she vowed.Mr. Hummel said he feared that landlords would use the fire to justify kicking out low-rent tenants, skirting the city\u2019s considerable tenant protections to upgrade and get higher-paying renters.Mr. Hummel, who used to live in a communal warehouse space, said he has been to many other artist spaces, and though they might not be up to code, they are not nearly as dangerous as the Ghost Ship, which residents say had a makeshift electrical system and timber artwork, wooden partitions and a wooden staircase \u2014 what proved to be a treacherous mix of combustible materials.Artist warehouses had gone five decades without a catastrophic fire like this, he pointed out.\u201cThe majority of these places are not an inferno waiting to happen,\u201d he said.videoAdvertisement"}

On Dec. 21, the second part of the ceremony took place at the home of the groom\u2019s parents in Fullerton, Calif.Dr. Pulido, 28, is taking her husband\u2019s name. She is a third-year internal medicine resident at Boston University Medical Center. She graduated summa cum laude from Yale, from which she also received a master\u2019s degree in molecular, cellular and developmental biology. She received a medical degree from Columbia.She is a daughter of Dr. Michelle Z. Pulido and Waldo V. Pulido. The bride\u2019s mother works in Las Vegas as a hospitalist for the Southern Nevada Healthcare System, run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Her father retired as an environmental engineer for the United States Air Force. He was last stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas.Dr. Nguyen, also 28, is in his third year of medical school as part of a combined M.D.-Ph.D. program run by Harvard Medical School and M.I.T., from which he received his Ph.D. in cell biology. He graduated with honors and distinction from Stanford.He is a son of Tuyetmai L. Nguyen and Tanh V. Nguyen. The groom\u2019s father is an aerospace engineer with Northrop Grumman in Los Angeles.Dr. Pulido and Dr. Nguyen met through a mutual friend in Boston in November 2010, during a Harvard-Yale football game. At the time, Dr. Pulido was living in New York, having graduated from Yale six months earlier, and was visiting her two best friends in Boston. Dr. Nguyen was a first-year medical student at Harvard.Although they were on opposite sides of the rivalry, Dr. Nguyen said he \u201cchose to go over to where she was sitting and extend an olive branch.\u201d\u201cShe was beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talked for about a half an hour, and in that time, I could tell she was a sweet and very intelligent person and that we had a lot in common.\u201dOne of those things in common, however, was that they were both in relationships with other people.\u201cThough I was dating someone else at the time, Anthony made a big impression on me,\u201d Dr. Pulido said. \u201cHe was very good-looking and very easy to talk to, definitely someone I wanted to keep in touch with.\u201dThey friended each other on Facebook but eventually fell out of touch, though both admitted they never stopped thinking about the other.\u201cI always kept her phone number, just in case,\u201d Dr. Nguyen said.Dr. Pulido said: \u201cI had really liked him. I was able to keep up with what he was doing through our mutual friend.\u201dThree years later, each had become unattached, and Dr. Pulido wasted little time in trying to reconnect with Dr. Nguyen.\u201cI called our mutual friend and said, \u2018Put in the good word for me,\u2019\u201d Dr. Pulido said, laughing. \u201cI was still very interested in Anthony because I felt we were living similar lives as far as being in medical school and that we were from similar backgrounds, so I knew deep down that he was someone I would do very well with.\u201dDr. Pulido, who was still living in New York and finishing up her medical degree, took a trip to Boston to visit another friend in June 2013. Dr. Nguyen, who was now studying for his Ph.D. at Harvard, made it his business to see her. He sent her an invite via Facebook to get together, and she accepted.\u201cI was very excited, yet very nervous,\u201d Dr. Pulido said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in over three years, and I began to wonder, \u2018What if this doesn\u2019t turn out the way I think it will?\u2019\u201dNevertheless, she met him one night at Harvard Square, and they decided to crash a reunion being held by the Harvard Class of 2008.\u201cHe was even more handsome than I remembered him,\u201d Dr. Pulido said. \u201cHe was also a perfect gentlemen, and we started talking again so easily. Nothing had really changed in three years.\u201dThe next weekend, Dr. Nguyen returned the favor and visited Dr. Pulido in New York.\u201cWe had an amazing time together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were so compatible, and she was so incredibly kind, thoughtful and sweet.\u201dThey soon embarked on a long-distance relationship that grew considerably shorter in March 2014, when Dr. Pulido \u2014 with Dr. Nguyen by her side \u2014 opened a letter informing her that she had been accepted in a residency program at Boston University Medical Center.\u201cWe were ecstatic,\u201d Dr. Nguyen said. \u201cThat same month, we rented a truck and moved all of her stuff to Boston, as I wasn\u2019t going to waste any time starting our new life together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In June, Facebook began rolling out automated, \u201ccommunity-generated\u201d Safety Checks.\u201cAs with all Safety Check activations, Facebook relies on a trusted third party to first confirm the incident and then on the community to use the tool and share with friends and family,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.The result has been a major increase in the use of the tool. Facebook said more than 350 Safety Checks have been activated since June, almost nine times the total of the previous two years.The Bangkok \u201cexplosion\u201d had been confirmed by the third party based on two local media reports about the firecracker protest, Anna White, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in an email. She acknowledged that the bogus stories should not have been featured on the automatically generated page, but said they were not a factor in the activation of the Safety Check.\u201cThere was very limited news coverage of this incident early on, and so the articles pulled in were not relevant,\u201d Ms. White said in an email. \u201cThis is definitely not the experience we want to give people \u2014 the entire point of Safety Check is to be useful and helpful to people in times of need.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The first classes of the day were over, and students had evacuated Watts Hall, an engineering building, because of a fire alarm.Mr. Artan, a logistics management major who lived off campus and was enrolled in 14.5 credit hours this fall, had woken up hours earlier, venturing to a Walmart and buying a knife, police officials said. There is some question about Mr. Artan\u2019s age, though college records say he was 18.His whereabouts in the hours after he bought the knife remain unclear, and investigators have appealed for help in piecing together his movements. At some point, he logged onto Facebook and wrote a manifesto hinting of what was to come.He wrote that he was \u201csick and tired of seeing my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters being killed and tortured EVERYWHERE,\u201d according to a law enforcement official who did not want to be identified because of the continuing investigation. \u201cWilling to kill a billion infidels in retribution for a single DISABLED Muslim,\u201d the post continued.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think \u2014 I thought maybe this was a car accident,\u201d Professor Clark recalled after being discharged from the hospital. Then he heard screams, apparently as Mr. Artan got out of the car and started slashing people with a knife. \u201cAt that point, I figured out it was more than just a car accident,\u201d he said.Officer Alan Horujko of the university\u2019s Police Department, who was nearby, arrived within about a minute and warned Mr. Artan to drop his knife, the authorities said. When he did not, Officer Horujko fired, killing Mr. Artan and injuring a bystander.On his first day on Ohio State\u2019s sprawling campus in August, Mr. Artan was waiting for a class to begin and struggling to find a private place to pray.Kevin Stankiewicz, a reporter for Ohio State\u2019s student newspaper, The Lantern, happened to be passing by, and asked Mr. Artan if he would be open to an interview. He agreed, and the two engaged in a wide-ranging discussion of Islamophobia, Mr. Artan\u2019s unease with worshiping publicly and his journey from Somalia to Pakistan to Texas to Ohio.Mr. Stankiewicz said that Mr. Artan also told him Donald J. Trump, who months later would be elected president, \u201cwas not educated on Islam,\u201d and that he rattled off a list of news events that he said revealed anti-Muslim bias in American society.Mr. Artan, who spoke English with only a slight accent, came across as smart, thoughtful and engaging, Mr. Stankiewicz recalled.\u201cIt was just such a great conversation,\u201d said Mr. Stankiewicz, who snapped a few photos of Mr. Artan before they parted ways, excited to publish part of the interview in The Lantern. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is what people need to hear.\u2019\u201dMr. Artan arrived in the United States in 2014 as the child of a refugee. He had fled war-ravaged Somalia as a youth, finding refuge in Pakistan, where he lived with other refugees on a narrow Islamabad road known to locals as Somali Street.\u201cHe was a very normal, young boy,\u201d said Muhammad Ali, who knew Mr. Artan during his time in Pakistan. \u201cHe was religious and used to pray regularly, but he did not have any extremist tendencies.\u201dMr. Stankiewicz said Mr. Artan spoke highly of his time in Pakistan. When he came to the United States, Mr. Artan initially settled in Dallas, apparently with help from Catholic Charities, but soon left for Columbus, where the Somali population has grown considerably in recent years.Neighbors in Ohio said Mr. Artan was part of a large immigrant family, but few knew much about them.At Columbus State, a two-year college where many Somalis study, some classmates recalled him as a diligent student. Myranda Thompson, who took a sociology class with Mr. Artan, said he \u201chad a passion for his religion\u201d and spoke of Islam frequently. Frank Oteng, who helped Mr. Artan with his statistics classwork, said Mr. Artan was focused on his studies, spoke hopefully of transferring to Ohio State and \u201cseemed very normal.\u201dSince Monday, many whose paths had crossed with Mr. Artan said they have struggled to reconcile their memories of him with the image of an extremist.Just days before the attack, Mr. Oteng spotted Mr. Artan at Ohio State and congratulated him on transferring. It was a pleasant, cheerful conversation, he said. Mr. Stankiewicz, the campus newspaper reporter, said he never saw Mr. Artan after that interview on his first day at Ohio State.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Mr. Stankiewicz said.Mitch Smith reported from Columbus, and Adam Goldman from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Salman Masood in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Owen J. Daugherty, Sheridan L. Hendrix and Travis Hoewischer in Columbus.videoAdvertisement"}

A crinkling of noses and the occasional \u201ceww.\u201d It was definitely mine.The key is to start with a good hot chocolate, said Jacques Torres, a New York pastry chef whose public identity is so fused with chocolate that he is known as \u201cMr. Chocolate.\u201cYou\u2019re going to use real chocolate,\u201d he said, not cocoa powder, and warm it with milk and a bit of condensed milk for extra silkiness.\u201cFinished chocolate has all the flavor you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s smooth and silky; it doesn\u2019t have any bitterness.\u201dMr. Torres also suggested an important deviation from most of the recipes out there: Do not heat up the wine and the chocolate together.

Allspice, cloves, star anise and cinnamon rounded it out.And then I stood facing two simmering pots of liquid that my brain was still screaming should not be combined.Wine is good, I told myself. Hot chocolate is good. So both went into a mug, were stirred together and topped with a marshmallow.And it was absolutely delicious.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Their student debt from graduate school would usually cut short any talk of marriage and merging their financial affairs, Dr. Nieves said.Then, as election night unfolded, Dr. Nieves recalled turning to Mr. Foote and saying, \u201cI really think we need to rethink this marriage idea.\u201d The two now plan to marry in the next few weeks in a civil ceremony in nearby Seneca Falls.\u201cThese cases have gone to the Supreme Court,\u201d he told Ms. Stahl. \u201cThey\u2019ve been settled.

The unexpected election of Mr. Trump upended their plans as well. Instead, they were married on Monday at City Hall in Dover, N.H.Overturning the Obergefell ruling would be a tall order according to Dale Carpenter, a constitutional law professor at Southern Methodist University who is in a same-sex marriage himself and generally identifies as a Republican. Test cases, he said, could evolve from some of the religious-based challenges in Oregon, Colorado and Mississippi, and Texas legislators are flirting with bills that would require state officials to enforce the state\u2019s Bill of Rights, which defines marriage as something that \u201conly\u201d occurs between a man and a woman. Nonetheless, Professor Carpenter said it was unlikely the Supreme Court would reopen debate or reverse itself in the next four years \u2014 even if the makeup of the court became increasingly conservative.Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, called the Obergefell ruling, \u201ca decision as close to being etched in stone as any Supreme Court decision in recent years.\u201dMr. Brooke added, \u201cWe don\u2019t know how dark the future will be for LGBTQ individuals in the four years to come, but we do know it will be harder to dissolve existing marriages than to prevent new ones, and we\u2019d rather not take our chances.\u201dWhat seems to trouble some of these gay and lesbian couples the most are not the specific positions taken by Mr. Trump, but those of his more conservative supporters.Jim Obergefell, the widower whose name is on the 2015 Supreme Court decision affirming same-sex marriage because of the lawsuit he brought demanding Ohio authorities name him on his husband\u2019s death certificate, said he doesn\u2019t know what gay and lesbian couples can expect under a Trump administration.\u201cI am not sure any of us do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he does either. He says one thing, and five minutes later, he says the exact opposite.\u201dStill, Mr. Obergefell said, if people are rushing off to marry out of some grim concern that their rights will not be there tomorrow, \u201cit\u2019s a shame that something that should be so joyous and about nothing more than love is being done out of fear.\u201dStephanie Holloway, 41, a graphic designer, is raising two young daughters with her fianc\u00e9e, Leseliey Welch, 38, in Ferndale, Mich. They have been together for 13 years but had resisted getting married until now, in part because they have had their hearts set on having \u201cthe whole shebang\u201d with 50 guests on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The last few weeks have left them badly shaken and going \u201cback and forth\u201d about what to do and when.Ordained as a Universal Life minister last year, Ms. Whelan has only performed two weddings, both times for friends. But wanting to help those who are concerned about their future under the new administration, she announced on Facebook that she was available for any same-sex couple in Ohio wishing to marry between now and Inauguration Day.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot I can do, but that is something I can do,\u201d Ms. Whelan said.Other businesses have since piled on.

Ms. Richards sent four messages in January that said things such as: \u201cYou gonna die. Death is coming to you real soon,\u201d according to an indictment made public on Wednesday.Ms. Richards\u2019s belief \u201cthat the school shooting was a hoax and never happened allegedly motivated her to make the charged threats,\u201d the United States attorney\u2019s office in Miami said in a statement. Each charge carries a maximum five-year sentence upon conviction.According to the indictment, the threats were sent to a parent identified only as \u201cL.P.\u201d The initials are an apparent reference to Lenny Pozner, whose son, Noah, was the youngest of 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School four years ago.Mr. Pozner, who now lives in Florida, dedicates himself to unmasking the various conspiracy theorists who blog about Sandy Hook, suggesting that the Obama administration orchestrated the massacre using actors to further a gun-control agenda.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what trolls are,\u201d Mr. Pozner told the magazine. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feed them, they don\u2019t just go away.\u201dThe professor, who was tenured, was soon fired, and he blamed Mr. Pozner.Mr. Tracy, a communications professor who taught classes including one on the \u201cCulture of Conspiracy,\u201d is suing to get his job back.

{"Headline": "Trump Plans Technology Conference With Silicon Valley Executives", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byTransition Briefing\u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump plans a technology conference next week with high-profile business executives, many of whom opposed his campaign.\u25a0 The chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent company says many of those jobs at that plant in Indiana will now be lost to automation.\u25a0 Vice President-elect Mike Pence says the national security adviser-designate\u2019s son has nothing to do with the transition, and it appears he no longer does.\u25a0 Mr. Trump, who flies in his own private jet, appears to have ordered the cancellation of the next generation of Air Force One \u2014 via Twitter.President-elect Trump is planning to convene a technology conference next week, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.The tech industry was almost universally opposed to Mr. Trump, which might give the meeting a touch of combativeness. His transition team and cabinet posts draw much more heavily from Wall Street than Silicon Valley.There is one major exception: Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump backer who is now in New York helping with the transition. Late last week, David Sacks, the chief executive of Zenefits, said he was stepping down amid conflicting reports that he will be working on the transition as well. Mr. Sacks is a longtime associate of Mr. Thiel.The list of those being invited was not immediately clear, but among those expected are Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google.The president-elect\u2019s move to save 1,100 jobs at a Carrier furnace plant in Indiana has been a political winner, even if it has raised concerns among economists on the left and the right.Now the chief executive of United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent company, says in the end, many of those jobs (he put the figure at 800) likely will fall to automation rather than Mexico.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make up $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we\u2019ll make the capital investments there.\u201dMR. CRAMER: \u201cRight.\u201dMR. HAYES: \u201cBut what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.\u201dHe also confirmed that he feared standing up to the president-elect could be very costly to his conglomerate, which includes a lot of defense work.\u201cThere was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open. At the same time \u2014 and I\u2019ll tell you this because you and I \u2014 we know each other, but I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.\u201dThe president-elect has now taken shots at two American companies by name, Carrier and Boeing, which he suggested on Tuesday \u201cis doing a little bit of a number\u201d with the cost of an Air Force One redesign.That latter hit came after Boeing\u2019s chief executive told The Chicago Tribune he is leery of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies.How is business responding? Very cautiously.In a Business Roundtable conference call Tuesday to release its latest survey of how its members see the economy, Douglas R. Oberhelman, chairman of the business group and the chief executive of Caterpillar, did not criticize the president-elect\u2019s threats to punish companies if they move production abroad.\u201cI think it\u2019s a great dialogue,\u201d he said.Mr. Oberhelman did push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on American manufacturers that export products made overseas back into the United States.\u201cIf he thinks we can negotiate better, then we ought to,\u201d he said. \u201cI do worry about retaliation with a 35 percent tariff or a unilateral action against a trading partner, especially if it\u2019s a big one like China.\u201dVice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program, said on Tuesday that the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who posted a baseless fake news story on Twitter on Sunday night, has \u201cno involvement in the transition whatsoever.\u201d And indeed, Mike Flynn Jr. may have been pushed out.The younger Mr. Flynn has sat in on some transition meetings and lists it as part of his biography. Until Monday, he had a transition email and has served as General Flynn\u2019s chief of staff.But on Tuesday, emails to that transition address were bouncing back, and transition spokesman Jason Miller said on a morning conference call that the general\u2019s son is no longer involved.But the senior Flynn has put out conspiracy theories and fake news stories of his own on Twitter:Mr. Pence will speak Tuesday night at a Heritage Foundation event at, where else, the Trump International Hotel in Washington. No word yet what Heritage is paying the Trump Organization for the space.The Morning Consult poll, of course, showed the usual partisan divide. Only 37 percent of Trump voters said the president-elect was going a little heavy on the tweets, while 79 percent of Hillary Clinton voters thought so.Then again, there were considerably more voters for Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump.Regardless, he\u2019s tweeting anyway:It\u2019s war.\u201cElected leaders, they have to be gracious to Trump. That\u2019s not our role,\u201d said David Brock, the driving force behind several pro-Hillary Clinton efforts during the presidential election and the founder of American Bridge.Why American Bridge\u2019s advisers believe that what did not work during the election will suddenly succeed once Mr. Trump becomes president is unclear. During a conference call announcing its plans, an adviser went through the considerable resources the group can bring to bear like tens of thousands of hours of footage of Mr. Trump, an army of researchers digging into his background, a powerful media megaphone.American Bridge and other like-minded groups had all that during the campaign, of course. Asked what difference it all made, Mr. Brock pointed to the small comforts he could take in what was a devastating and unexpected loss: Mr. Trump\u2019s historically low approval ratings, the high share of voters who say a Trump presidency frightens them, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s success with low-income voters.And he added one more. \u201cWe did win the popular vote,\u201d Mr. Brock noted.By a lot \u2014 2,653,958 votes and still rising.Mr. Brock did not mention \u2014 nor was he asked \u2014 whether abolishing the Electoral College would be on American Bridge\u2019s agenda.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said Tuesday that it was \u201cprudent\u201d for President-elect Trump to accept a call from the leader of Taiwan, a move that has been sharply criticized as an affront to China.\u201cI think for him to not take a congratulatory call would in and of itself be considered a snub,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters.Mr. Ryan, who added that he had recently spoken to the Taiwanese president himself during a layover at a Miami airport, declined to comment on the appropriateness of Mr. Trump\u2019s subsequent Twitter posts about the call.\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to sit here and comment on the daily tweets?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not going to do that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we may have had some influence,\u201d Mr. Dole, the former Kansas senator and Republican presidential nominee, said.Christopher Suprun, a Republican elector from Texas, announced in The New York Times on Monday that he would not cast his vote for Mr. Trump when the Electoral College convenes \u2014 and a group of academics and lawyers are trying to coax more \u201cfaithless\u201d electors to follow suit.The United States was set up as a republic. Alexander Hamilton provided a blueprint for states\u2019 votes. Federalist 68 argued that an Electoral College should determine if candidates are qualified, not engaged in demagogy, and independent from foreign influence. Mr. Trump shows us again and again that he does not meet these standards. Given his own public statements, it isn\u2019t clear how the Electoral College can ignore these issues, and so it should reject him.To give encouragement, and legal support, the Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig and the law firm Durie Tangri have teamed up to start what they are calling the Electors Trust, offering free counsel to other electors pondering Mr. Suprun\u2019s route.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a CNBC commentator.

{"Headline": "Man Who Police Say Admitted Shooting Joe McKnight Is Freed Without Charge", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byThe man, Ronald Gasser, 54, was released overnight, hours after Mr. McKnight was shot three times about 2:45 p.m. Thursday in an apparent \u201croad rage\u201d episode in Terrytown, La., about five miles southeast of New Orleans, the sheriff\u2019s office said.In a statement, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office said that the two men had had a \u201cheated verbal exchange.\u201d During a news conference, Newell Normand, the sheriff, said the case might have escalated into violence because someone \u201crecklessly\u201d cut off the other while driving on a bridge.The decision to release Mr. Gasser, who is white, infuriated supporters and former teammates of Mr. McKnight, who was black, and they took to social media to express outrage.Sheriff Normand, appearing at times defiant and frustrated before reporters in Harvey, La., on Friday, said that the authorities would be very deliberate in the investigation, that witnesses were still being located and interviewed, and that people planning to protest must do it within a designated area or they would be jailed.\u201cThis investigation is not going to be moved, influenced, coerced or changed in any way by any external force, comments or otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t control what\u2019s on the social networks, and if we want to continue to be silly, that\u2019s fine.\u201dAsked if the case would be investigated as a hate crime, Sheriff Normand said that there was no evidence yet to suggest that it should be. \u201cEverybody wants to make this about race,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about race.\u201dAsked why Mr. Gasser was freed if he had admitted to the shooting, he said that in Louisiana there were some \u201crelative statutes that provide defenses to certain crimes\u201d and that the authorities would need to determine whether the shooting was justified.Sheriff Normand disputed several rumors that had spread on social media, including that Mr. Gasser had stood over Mr. McKnight as he fired the gun, that a video has been recovered and that a witness had said Mr. McKnight apologized to Mr. Gasser before the shooting.All of those are false, he said, and he advised people to believe only what they heard from officials like himself and the district attorney. \u201cI strongly suggest you stop believing what you\u2019re reading,\u201d he said.Councilman Mark Spears, who also spoke at the news conference, said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a rush to judgment. The facts are still coming out, and we should base it on facts, not on Facebook and other social media.\u201d He also said officials were \u201cpraying\u201d for the McKnight family.In a statement released before the news conference, the sheriff\u2019s office said that Mr. Gasser had handed over a semiautomatic handgun to officers at the scene. The sheriff said at the news conference that Mr. Gasser had fired three rounds from inside his vehicle.At a news conference, local N.A.A.C.P. officials criticized the authorities for releasing Mr. Gasser, pledging to demonstrate peacefully.\u201cWe think a black man was lynched yesterday,\u201d said Morris Reed, the president of the New Orleans branch of the N.A.A.C.P. \u201cWe are demanding some answers.\u201dMoe Reed Jr., a lawyer, added, \u201cThere is nothing that could\u2019ve happened yesterday at 3 p.m. in broad daylight on a Louisiana highway, in front of many people passing back and forth in front of a gas station, that would make this man feel that he was in danger of losing his life.\u201dMr. McKnight\u2019s family is also seeking answers, his grandmother Barbara Franklin told The Associated Press on Friday. She said she had learned of Mr. Gasser\u2019s release through the radio. \u201cHe might be released now, but God is going to bring about justice,\u201d she said.Mr. McKnight, a running back and special teams standout, was a decorated player at the University of Southern California. He was picked in the fourth round of the N.F.L. draft by the New York Jets, where he played from 2010 to 2012 before being cut by the team in 2013.He played two more N.F.L. games with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014. In February, he joined the Canadian Football League, spending time with the Edmonton Eskimos and the Saskatchewan Roughriders.Mr. Gasser is the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, according to The New Orleans Advocate.The sheriff\u2019s office on Friday night released details of a previous assault charge against Mr. Gasser stemming from an episode that happened at the same intersection as the shooting on Thursday.It happened on Feb. 20, 2006, after a 51-year-old man called 911 to report that the driver of a red pickup truck was driving unsafely. The man saw a phone number on the truck to call if it was being operated unsafely and when he called the number, Mr. Gasser said he was the one driving.Investigators at a later date found Mr. Gasser and he was issued a misdemeanor summons for simple battery, which was dismissed, the office said. \u201cWe will continue to research this matter in order to determine the reason for the dismissal,\u201d the statement said.On Friday some social media users and McKnight\u2019s former Jets teammates expressed bafflement and anger after Mr. Gasser was released.Damien Woody, a former offensive lineman and current N.F.L. analyst for ESPN, also said he had trouble understanding the move.\u201cNormand is going to have a tough time convincing the public that this isn\u2019t another example of disparate responses to identical situations, another example of the race of the suspect altering the response to the crime,\u201d he wrote.Christopher Mele and Campbell Robertson contributed reporting, and Jack Begg contributed reseach.Advertisement"}

Mr. Snowden, who is living in asylum in Russia, is wanted in the United States on several charges, including two under the United States Espionage Act of 1917.Speaking by video link during the Athens Democracy Forum in Greece, convened by The New York Times in September, Mr. Snowden said that his disclosures had improved privacy in the United States and that \u201cbeing patriotic doesn\u2019t mean simply agreeing with your government.\u201dQ. There\u2019s a campaign for President Obama to pardon you before he leaves office. For many people, you\u2019re a whistle-blowing hero, and for many other people you\u2019re a traitor who broke your oath and betrayed your country. Having knowingly broken the law and fled the jurisdiction of the American courts, why should you be granted asylum?I never published a single document on my own. I partnered with some of the most respected news outlets in the world: The Washington Post and The Guardian. These groups received the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their reporting. This is why we have a free press in a democracy. The government has many great powers, particularly as they relate to the handling of state secrets, but it is the press that is charged with determining what information is truly within the public interest to know.Daniel Ellsberg, a fellow whistle-blower who released the Pentagon Papers in 1971, put himself forward to the court, understanding that the history of civil disobedience is being willing to accept any punishment for the moral act of standing up against authority. Why would you not return to face a jury in America?Can there be a fair trial when you can\u2019t put forward a defense? At the sentencing phase you can express to the judge why you did what you did, but that is not democratic. The jury system was created so you can discuss with your peers what you did, why you did it.You\u2019ve said that concrete improvements have transpired as a direct result of your revelations. Are you concerned that governments are still doing whatever they want to do by other means or that these results are transitory?The U.S. has right now a two-tiered system of handling surveillance. If you\u2019re a U.S. citizen, the government will go to a court to get a warrant before they spy on you. This is almost always a secret court called the FISA court, which in 33 years was asked roughly 34,000 times to authorize surveillance and only said no 11 times. They\u2019re a rubber stamp. If you\u2019re not a U.S. citizen, no warrant is required at all in most cases. That\u2019s gotten a little bit better because some companies have actually begun resisting these demands. This is uncomfortable for some governments, but there is no question that this is very positive in terms of the protection of rights and the enforcement of due process around the world.Stewart Baker, former general counsel for the National Security Agency, is against a pardon for you. He believes the benefits of the leaks could have been achieved with only three or four documents and that the flood of documents released harmed United States intelligence and national interests. Do you believe that if you\u2019d leaked less you might have had the same effect?What does it mean when we\u2019re saying to journalists that it\u2019s O.K. if they run the first three stories, but after they run the next three or the next 300, that\u2019s too much? Who makes that decision? I believe that it should be the press. They\u2019re the best placed to make those decisions, and that\u2019s why we have the First Amendment.I\u2019m certainly with you there. You don\u2019t speak a lot of Russian, and it\u2019s not a place you particularly wanted to be. What do you do all day?It\u2019s an income.When many people think about privacy they think about their Facebook settings, but privacy is actually the fountainhead of all our rights. It is the right from which all others are derived and is what makes you an individual. It is the right to an independent mind and life.Freedom of speech doesn\u2019t have meaning without the protected space to speak freely. The same [goes] for freedom of religion: If you can\u2019t decide for yourself what you want to worship, you\u2019ll simply adopt whatever is popular or whatever the state religion is to avoid the judgment of others.The less power you wield within society, the stronger your case for your personal privacy. If you\u2019re an individual and you don\u2019t really have any influence over anything, you are the target audience for which privacy was designed. If you\u2019re a public official, if you enjoy an incredible amount of privilege and influence, transparency is intended for you. It\u2019s the only way that we can hold you to the account of our standards and laws and be able to cast our votes in an informed way.You\u2019ve said that you think of yourself as still working for the United States.

{"Headline": "Carson Is New Sign Trump Plans to Govern From the Right", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump is moving to repudiate vast parts of President Obama\u2019s domestic agenda as he fills his cabinet with conservatives who have long records opposing the current administration on social programs, wages, public lands, veterans and the environment.Mr. Trump\u2019s selections to lead the Departments of Education, Commerce, Justice, and Health and Human Services, and the names under consideration for other federal agencies with broad authority over the lives of Americans, have cheered Republicans in Washington, who have spent eight years battling Mr. Obama\u2019s administration.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that elections have consequences,\u201d said Thomas M. Davis, a former congressman from Virginia, who said he was impressed by the ideological philosophy of Mr. Trump\u2019s domestic agency appointments. \u201cRepublican philosophy says markets can do a better job. It\u2019s a huge clash with Obama.\u201dPresident-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.If he is confirmed, Mr. Carson will embrace a starkly different approach to those problems, compared with housing secretaries during Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure. He opposes government programs that he says encourage \u201cdependency,\u201d and he has been fiercely critical of housing programs intended to end segregation.Mr. Carson joins a growing cast of nominees who, if confirmed, will assume control of hundreds of thousands of federal employees as they seek to shift policies developed during nearly a decade of Democratic governance.Aside from his focus on immigration and the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump spent little time on the campaign trail detailing a specific policy agenda. But many of his nominees have spent their careers advocating positions that will now become the focus of examination during their confirmation hearings. Taken together, they suggest an administration determined to alter course on immigration, abortion, housing laws, the environment, worker protections and privatization of federal functions.\u201cWe will learn a lot more during the hearings,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cCertainly, I think it\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve seen in the last eight years.\u201dOn the domestic front, announcements of several cabinet posts are helping to define the new president\u2019s approach to issues at home. His choices so far suggest a more conservative approach to many domestic issues than Mr. Trump himself articulated during the campaign.This week, Mr. Trump is expected to fill a series of positions that will accelerate the U-turn from current policies.He is said to be seriously considering Mary Fallin, Oklahoma\u2019s Republican governor, for interior secretary, which would presage a shift away from the department\u2019s current approach toward energy and public lands. Mr. Obama has aggressively sought to shut down fossil fuel production and increase the use of renewable sources of energy, while Ms. Fallin is an outspoken proponent of drilling and fracking on public lands. She was the first governor to announce she would oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed rules on emissions from coal-fired power plants.And former Senator Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican, may get the nod to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Brown, who met with the president-elect last month about taking the job, might reverse the current administration\u2019s opposition to privatizing parts of the department.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to outsource some of those cases to private vendors, obviously,\u201d Mr. Brown told reporters at Trump Tower after his meeting. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work with the Department of Defense so when that soon-to-be-veteran actually leaves the D.O.D., we know what his or her needs are. There\u2019s a breakdown there.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition said Monday that several cabinet announcements and White House staffing decisions were \u201clikely\u201d this week, following the president-elect\u2019s recent picks to oversee the Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Commerce Departments.Last month, Mr. Trump announced that he had chosen Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. Ms. DeVos, a longtime Republican fund-raiser, has spent nearly 30 years pushing for families to receive public funds to send their children to private and parochial schools, usually to the consternation of teacher unions.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.She is certain to challenge the approach that Mr. Obama and his administration have followed, often with the support of those same unions. After being chosen by Mr. Trump, she wrote on her Facebook page, \u201cThe status quo in ed is not acceptable.\u201dAnd Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to be the next attorney general, has long been a fierce advocate of a crackdown on immigrants who are in the country illegally. He was one of the most vocal opponents of an immigration overhaul, calling it amnesty. And in speeches from the floor of the Senate, he railed against Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions aimed at protecting some immigrants from deportation.These choices have put Democrats and liberal activists on notice that the agenda in Washington is changing, Mr. Davis, the former congressman, said. \u201cThis is clearly not going to be pleasing to them,\u201d he said.In a statement last week, Richard L.

{"Headline": "Forget AT&T. The Real Monopolies Are Google and Facebook.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner has drawn censure from both sides of the political aisle, as well as a Senate hearing that looked into the potential for the combined company to become a monopoly.But if we are going to examine media monopolies, we should look first at Silicon Valley, not the fading phone business.Mark Cuban, the internet entrepreneur, said at the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last week that the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.\u201cFacebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,\u201d he said.Look at the numbers. Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Facebook are among the 10 largest companies in the world. Alphabet alone has a market capitalization of around $550 billion. AT&T and Time Warner combined would be about $300 billion.Alphabet has an 83 percent share of the mobile search market in the United States and just under 63 percent of the US mobile phone operating systems market. AT&T has a 32 percent market share in mobile phones and 26 percent in pay TV. The combined AT&T-Time Warner will have $8 billion in cash but $171 billion of net debt, according to the research company MoffettNathanson. Compare that to Alphabet\u2019s balance sheet, with total cash of $76 billion and total debt of about $3.94 billion.In the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in online advertising will go to Google or Facebook, according to Brian Nowak, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.Google and Facebook can achieve huge net profit margins because they dominate the content made available on the web while making very little of it themselves. Instead, they both have built their advertising businesses as \u201cfree riders\u201d on content made by others, some of it from Time Warner. The rise of these digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries of our country.Every pirated music video or song posted on YouTube or Facebook robs the creators of income, and YouTube in particular is dominated by unlicensed content. Google\u2019s YouTube has an over 55 percent market share in the streaming audio business and yet provides less than 11 percent of the streaming audio revenues to the content owners and creators. But Facebook, which refuses to enter into any licensing agreement on music or video, is challenging YouTube in the free online video and music world.In the past decade, an enormous reallocation of revenue of perhaps $50 billion a year has taken place, with economic value moving from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms.I reached this conclusion from the following statistics: Since 2000, recorded music revenues in the United States have fallen to $7.2 billion per year from $19.8 billion. Home entertainment video revenue fell to $18 billion in 2014 from $24.2 billion in 2006. United States newspaper ad revenue fell to $23.6 billion in 2013 from $65.8 billion in 2000.And yet, by every available metric, people are consuming more music, video, news and books. During that same period, Google\u2019s revenue grew to $74.5 billion from $400 million.The former editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, estimated that Facebook had \u201csucked up $27 million\u201d of the paper\u2019s projected digital advertising revenue in the last year by essentially keeping Guardian readers on Facebook, rather than linking them to the Guardian site.\u201cThey are taking all the money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey have algorithms we don\u2019t understand, which are a filter between what we do and how people receive it.\u201dBut the problem isn\u2019t just for musicians, authors, filmmakers or even the phone company. As the former Google \u201cdesign ethicist\u201d Tristan Harris wrote, \u201cIf you control the menu, you control the choices.\u201dWe have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the menu (Google\u2019s search rankings and Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed). How that menu is determined by these black box algorithms isn\u2019t known by anyone outside those companies. As more and more of our lives become digital, these new algorithms will assume more power over our lives.Regulators should take a hard look at the merger between AT&T and Time Warner. After the hearing on Wednesday, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the antitrust subcommittee, suggested that what was needed were hearings that would also include Alphabet and Facebook. She\u2019s right.But in some ways, that\u2019s just fighting the last war. We have gone through a long election cycle without any discussion about the unregulated world now dominated by a few Silicon Valley giants. Perhaps in January we can have an honest national conversation on monopoly and our future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World of Surveillance Doesn\u2019t Always Help to Catch a Thief", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, I had a beer in one of the more budget-conscious bars in the Mission district. My wallet stayed a little later than I did.I didn\u2019t notice that until 11 a.m. the next day, when I got a call from my bank. Hey, a helpful man in card fraud detection asked, in the last 12 hours had I been to McDonald\u2019s twice, taken four rides with Uber, purchased a disposable phone at MetroPCS, and visited Walgreens and Target?What followed was sadly familiar to many of us: I spent the day canceling credit cards, ordering new health insurance identification, replacing my driver\u2019s license, and trying to remember what else, besides cash, was in my wallet.A week later, relatively whole again in plastic, I received from my bank a list of all of the charges (which the bank covered). They provided a rough guide to the evening.Looking at the numbers, I began to wonder: How many times, during that disappointingly banal crime spree, was my thief photographed, tagged, measured or otherwise observed in our semi-constant world of databases? And with a modest effort, how hard would it then be for the police to find him?The answer to the first question is, probably several dozen times. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all this monitoring is helpful to someone like me.Some companies are reluctant to talk about how much they are filming you, or how long they keep the images. Others simply have a hard time knowing.For example, about 90 percent of the 13,000 or so McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the United States are owned by independent owner-operators, so the company can\u2019t really say if those people have cameras. \u201cWe assume the majority do,\u201d said Terri Hickey, a company spokeswoman. \u201cWe strongly recommend their installation and use.\u201dWhat about a McDonald\u2019s in San Francisco? \u201cAlmost certainly there\u2019s cameras, inside and out,\u201d said Grace Gatpandan, an officer with the city\u2019s Police Department. \u201cIf it\u2019s a drive-through, they\u2019re going to have a camera.\u201d Some of those cameras are to record people who try to drive off without paying, or to catch employee theft.A Walgreens at 23rd and Mission Streets, another stop that night, is well equipped with cameras, too. \u201cAt least two in the pharmacy, the entranceway, probably over the shopping aisles,\u201d said Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman. \u201cWe like those, and some of the ones on the exterior, to be visible, and we put a sign in the front so people know they\u2019re being filmed.\u201dLike many other big stores, Walgreens often has other, smaller cameras about door height, to catch faces in case the police want close-ups of people.Target was not willing to talk about what my thief bought with my card, or its use of video, but it may be the most extensive watcher of all. Just the checkout area of its store at Fourth and Mission Streets in San Francisco, the most likely location my thief visited, has at least 18 cameras, from four manufacturers.The thief spent almost $200 at Target, enough to afford nine of the 13 different home video surveillance cameras Target sells there. That would have involved walking past another 50 highly visible surveillance domes.The San Francisco Police Department likes this video deluge, according to a department spokesman, Carlos Manfredi, because things like credit card fraud are often linked to other crimes. \u201cWe\u2019ll circulate pictures of people to all the stations around town, to see if other officers know the person from other crimes,\u201d he said.They also go up on private channels on YouTube and Vimeo, he said.My case was at the other end of the crime spectrum, but even the style of the crime provides clues about the thief. This man or woman started small, with the McDonald\u2019s and Walgreens purchases, and apparently made the big purchase at Target once there was confidence the card was going through. The thief also stuck to one card.Is it weird to feel a little shame here? What, my card isn\u2019t good enough for the high-end service?Mr. Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor in Las Vegas who has also worked at eBay and Facebook, said criminals called these small purchases \u201cbust-out charges.\u201d \u201cYou go little at first, make sure the card works,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen you go big.\u201d My bank appears to have stepped in right after the first substantial purchase.That isn\u2019t to say that my thief was a master criminal. I don\u2019t have an Uber account, and he (Mr. Sullivan\u2019s term, though Uber\u2019s privacy rules prevented the company from telling me anything more) put the card on an existing account.Uber also has GPS data on every ride, time stamps on rides, and the names of drivers. The drivers are allowed cameras of their own in cars, but Uber doesn\u2019t know how many use them.\u201cIf the police are interested in your case, we have a lot we can share with them,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Big \u201cif.\u201d After two visits and three calls to the Mission district station, and three calls and two emails with San Francisco Police Department public affairs (a route not open to most civilians), the police assigned someone to my case. That was well over a month after the theft. Walgreens gave them some video, which has been circulated, but Target had already junked its footage.Uber, which over its four rides obtained route information and the person\u2019s address, was not contacted.Advertisement"}

Trump is postponing until January his announcement about how he will handle his private business interests.\u25a0 The Clinton campaign breaks its silence and demands declassification of the intelligence on Russian election meddling.\u25a0 Mr. Trump takes to Twitter to deny Russian involvement in his victory.\u25a0 Senator John McCain says there is no doubt about Russian hacking, which he called \u201cwarfare.\u201d\u25a0 Carly Fiorina for director of national intelligence? She certainly took the president-elect\u2019s line on China.For those waiting to see Mr. Trump hold a news conference to discuss the ethical concerns about conflicts with his business, you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer.Transition officials said on Monday evening that they were postponing a news conference scheduled for Thursday at which Mr. Trump had said he would reveal his plans to avoid conflicts of interest with his sprawling real estate business.The president-elect instead will make that announcement in January \u2014 likely before his inauguration and after an extended vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida \u2014 officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News.Officials said the focus on building a cabinet had consumed more of Mr. Trump\u2019s time than expected. And they said that it was taking time to address how to address the large, iconic real estate holdings that are part of the global Trump business.As the swirl of allegations around Russia\u2019s efforts to elect Mr. Trump roils Washington, one voice has been absent: Hillary Clinton\u2019s.John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, broke the silence on her behalf, demanding the declassification of all information about Russia\u2019s meddling as well as an explanation from the Obama administration of what it knew and when it knew it.\u201cWe now know that the C.I.A. has determined Russia\u2019s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. \u201cThis should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d\u201cThis is not a partisan issue, and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia\u2019s role,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe believe that the administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia\u2019s interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia\u2019s roles in the election and to make this data available to the public.\u201dThrown on the defensive, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that the White House did not announce a major probe of Russia\u2019s interference before the election partly because many voters would have seen such an announcement as political meddling.He said Russia did not hack the electoral process or the counting of votes.\u201cBut what is also clear is that the results of the hack and leak effort carried out on the orders of Russia were extensively discussed prior to the election,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.And forensic analysis does allow experts to trace the source of a hack.On that one, he will have bipartisan support \u2014 just not in congressional districts where the fighter is built.Mr. McCain said on Monday that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking\u201d by Russian intelligence services into Democratic campaign accounts, which he called \u201canother form of warfare.\u201dAppearing on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next minority leader, Mr. McCain said the wide-ranging investigation of Russian meddling in the election would include his committee as well as the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees.He said a Senate investigation would be necessary despite President Obama having already ordered up an inquiry, as that one would not be completed before the end of the Obama administration. The implication was that the new Trump administration would not follow through.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to point a finger, and I don\u2019t want this to turn into the Benghazi investigation,\u201d Mr. Schumer added, referring to the House investigation into the attacks on an American compound in Libya, which he said had been partisan. \u201cThis is serious stuff.\u201d\u201cWe intend to discharge our duties as electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who, as our founding fathers envisioned, would be \u2018endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u2019 As electors, we also believe that deliberation is at the heart of democracy itself, not an empty or formalistic task. We do not understand our sole function to be to convene in mid-December, several weeks after Election Day, and summarily cast our votes.\u201dTheir request:\u201cThe Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations. We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as president of the United States.Additionally, the electors will separately require from Donald Trump conclusive evidence that he and his staff and advisers did not accept Russian interference, or otherwise collaborate during the campaign, and conclusive disavowal and repudiation of such collaboration and interference going forward.\u201dMs. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, emerged from a meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Monday to talk tough, not on Russia but on China, which she called \u201cour most important adversary and a rising adversary.\u201dMs. Fiorina was called in to discuss the job of director of national intelligence, a senior transition official said.And Ms. Fiorina, once a bitter foe of Mr. Trump\u2019s, was effusive.\u201cWe talked about hacking, whether it\u2019s Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talked about the opportunity that the president-elect has to literally reset things, to reset the trajectory of this economy, to reset the role of government, to reset America\u2019s role in the world and how we\u2019re perceived in the world. And I think it\u2019s why he\u2019s getting such fantastic people in his administration.\u201dAll appears to be forgiven.\u201cFirst I want to say, he has really cool stuff in his office,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of these athletes have given him all this incredible memorabilia. I was particular taken by Shaq O\u2019Neal\u2019s shoe, which is huge. I guess it takes a champion to know a champion.\u201dThree days ago, an image calling for the extermination of Muslims was posted on former Representative Allen West\u2019s Facebook page.The outrage prompted an aide to Mr. West, a former Army lieutenant colonel, to claim credit and take the image down.The outrage wasn\u2019t too great to deny Mr. West another audience with the president-elect on Monday at Trump Tower. Nor was it enough to prompt a question from the reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, though they did ask Mr. West about Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump president.Reporters: Should there be a bipartisan investigation of Russia hacking?Mr. West: \u201cI think there are more important things. We\u2019re about to see a collapse in Syria, Iraq is falling apart. the Iran nuclear deal is horrific. China and Russia are expanding. I think that\u2019s where we need to focus your intelligence efforts.\u201dAfter a campaign full of attacks on Wall Street \u2014 and Goldman Sachs in particular \u2014 Mr. Trump will have Goldman\u2019s No. 2 in the West Wing and a former Goldman partner, Steven Mnuchin, next door at Treasury, if he is confirmed.But the transition team tried to find something inspirational in the latest multimillionaire:\u201cIn addition to his incredible business history, Mr. Cohn has an inspiring personal story. Growing up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, he was diagnosed at age 7 with dyslexia.\u201dThat is one of the rare moments where Shaker Heights, an affluent suburb of Cleveland, is mined for inspirational struggle.Mr. Trump is looking at appointing a rising Republican star from South Dakota, Representative Kristi Noem, as his secretary of agriculture, a senior official working on the transition said Monday.The transition team is vetting Ms. Noem now, and she is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump this week.Ms. Noem, 45, would be one of the younger members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet \u2014 a group that so far consists mostly of older men.She has been planning to leave Congress at the end of her next term in 2018 to run for governor of South Dakota.Another name floated for the agriculture job, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is being considered for a variety of jobs, including energy secretary. Because she is a Democrat \u2014 and would likely be replaced in the Senate by a Republican \u2014 the transition official said she could essentially have \u201cwhatever job she wants.\u201dSpeaking of roles, the former Texas governor, Rick Perry, who wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy but could not remember its name on live television, has emerged as a leading candidate for energy secretary.Although Texas is rich in energy and Mr. Perry is big on extracting it, he cannot afford too many \u201coops moments\u201d if he is named to that post.The Energy Department\u2019s primary role is to design nuclear weapons and ensure the safety and reliability of the nation\u2019s aging nuclear arsenal \u2014 through a constellation of scientific laboratories. The two men who served as President Obama\u2019s energy secretaries were scientists, one with a Nobel Prize, the other from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Mr. Trump is also looking at two other possibilities for energy secretary. He likes Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 for the job. Both are under tremendous pressure from fellow Democrats not to accept a cabinet job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Austria\u2019s Far Right Signs a Cooperation Pact With Putin\u2019s Party", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 The leader of the Austrian far-right Freedom Party has signed what he called a cooperation agreement with Russia\u2019s ruling party and recently met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the designated national security adviser to President-elect Donald J. Trump of the United States.Word of the agreement with Russia was the latest sign that the Kremlin is forging bonds with political parties across Europe in what some European leaders suspect is a coordinated attempt to meddle in their affairs and potentially weaken Western democracies. Many of these efforts are murky and involve obscure groups, and it is unclear whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has any direct involvement.The Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, reported the signing of the agreement with United Russia, Mr. Putin\u2019s party, on Monday on his Facebook page, where he also disclosed that he had visited General Flynn a few weeks ago in Trump Tower in New York.\u201cInternationally, the Freedom Party continues to gain in influence,\u201d wrote Mr. Strache, a dental technician who has led the party since 2005.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.The Trump transition team did not respond to request for comment on the meeting.The Freedom Party, founded in the 1950s by ex-Nazis, surged this year to nearly capture the largely ceremonial presidency of Austria in May, but was defeated in a final runoff on Dec. 4. Still, its ascendance, alongside the rise of rightist parties in many European countries and with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, has raised new questions about political realignment across the continent.Mr. Strache\u2019s trips to New York and Moscow were clearly intended to convey the impression that the Freedom Party, which still leads all opinion polls ahead of the two mainstream parties that have governed Austria since World War II, has international standing and intends to continue vying for power.A text of the cooperation agreement, published in Russian on the website of United Russia and in German on the website of an Austrian journalist, Claus Pandi, outlined plans for regular meetings and collaboration where suitable on economic, business and political projects. It said the accord was valid for five years, but was not legally binding.It was signed for United Russia by Sergei Zheleznyak, a deputy to the party\u2019s general secretary who is among the Russian officials barred from the United States since March 2014 for supporting the Russian actions in Crimea.In welcoming the Austrians at party headquarters, Mr. Zheleznyak specifically mentioned Europe\u2019s \u201cmigration crisis\u201d as a field for cooperation, according to United Russia\u2019s website.The Freedom Party presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, had indicated he might use a little-noticed power of the president to dismiss the federal government, or at least some ministers, a move most observers forecast would precipitate new national elections.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Aside from sowing domestic ferment in Austria, a Freedom Party-led government would press to lift the sanctions imposed on Moscow for its 2014 seizure of Crimea and meddling in war-torn eastern Ukraine. On Facebook, Mr. Strache said Monday that having the United States and Russia stand together would be important to solving the crises in Syria and Crimea and \u201cto get rid of the sanctions that damage the economy and are in the end useless.\u201dAustria jealously guards its neutrality, adopted after the allies withdrew from the country in 1955, and there is considerable nostalgia for the Cold War role played by Vienna as a venue for United States-Soviet summits.In that spirit, the Freedom Party has long leaned toward Moscow. In the presidential campaign, Mr. Hofer had argued strongly that European sanctions imposed on Moscow should be dropped, a stance he reiterated in a lengthy interview with Russian television late last week.Russian media loyal to the Kremlin have emphasized for over a year that the influx of some one million migrants, many of them Muslim, has divided and weakened Europe, where Germany, Austria and Sweden bore the main burden of absorbing the newcomers.The Freedom Party is also anti-migrant, and seeks deep changes in the European Union, while stopping short of calls to follow Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc.Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy speaker of the Duma, or lower house of Russian Parliament, said there was a need for open dialogue to improve ties with parties across Europe, United Russia reported from the signing of the agreement. This was especially important, Mr. Tolstoy was quoted as saying, \u201cin today\u2019s politically correct world, when everyone is hiding their real thoughts and feelings.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Singing Together Again at a Broadway Reunion", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byI don\u2019t exactly spread this around, for obvious reasons, but I sang in a coed a cappella group in college. We knew enough to mock it, but we also all loved it, and yes, God save me, on more than one occasion we spontaneously broke out in six-part harmony, unbidden, at a fast-food restaurant. Despite such acts of deep earnestness, we considered ourselves the irreverent a cappella group on campus, at Yale; we liked to stop in the middle of the first song of our set and send my friend Jen, a tiny, beautiful soprano, out to the front of the stage to tell the audience a joke: \u201cMy boyfriend says I should tell him whenever I have an orgasm. But he\u2019s never there. So why bother?\u201d She\u2019s now a cantor outside Philadelphia.To say we were diverse would be a stretch, but the group did bring together people who had little in common other than the belief that they could sing (and had a high tolerance for bad, off-color jokes). There was a pageant queen from North Carolina, a Jersey girl who taught me at least three new terms for \u201cvagina,\u201d a preppy tenor who could put on a superb lockjaw, and there was James-Allen Ford, a Louisiana native who split his free time, the first month at college, between Bible study and rehearsal with us, Mixed Company.\u201cI feel really, really bad, because I like you, I really do,\u201d he told me the first time we got drunk together. \u201cBut you are going to go to hell, for sure.\u201d I was Jewish, and although he didn\u2019t hold it against me, he couldn\u2019t save me, either.That was, it turned out, not just the first time we ever got drunk together, but the first time he ever had an alcoholic drink. James-Allen got good at getting drunk, for a while, and eventually got good at knowing when to stop. He gave up on Bible study. He dated a young woman in the group, a lovely, kind psychology major, just the right kind of person to confide in when you are ready to tell people you are gay, which James-Allen eventually did.The truth is, we all confided something to one another. We traveled together (on tours during breaks \u2014 we killed at the nursing homes); more than a few of us slept with each other, which was only one reason we also fought with one another. We readily provided solace when needed and also competed for solos as if they were Supreme Court clerkships. And of course, several times a week, we sang together, a ritual through which all the other experiences were processed, cleansed and occasionally, made beautiful.By the time he was a sophomore, James-Allen was the pitch leading the group, a supremely elegant musician with perfect taste and a cultivated dark side for which we all felt both proud and somewhat responsible.We all graduated, eventually, and members of the group became lawyers and graphic designers and teachers and massage artists (O.K., only one massage artist). James-Allen got out of school and learned to say \u201cTurn your penny into a medallion souvenir\u201d in five languages, while selling souvenirs at the top floor of World Trade Center; for years, he tutored and worked as an executive assistant and a graphic designer, still hoping to become a professional musician in one form or another. Some of us stayed close, others drifted; most stayed connected to the group in some way, if only on Facebook, which is surely where I learned that 23 years after graduating, James-Allen Ford had made good, and in a way that made us all feel both proud and somewhat responsible.Last Sunday, around 30 Mixed Company alumni got together to go see the show James-Allen and his friends had written. One of the alumni hosted a brunch at his apartment beforehand. There had been talk, for a moment, about all of us getting together to sing at the theater before the performance; the business people wanted to film it and use it to market the show to other a cappella singing groups. At first, we were ecstatic, our inner hams unleashed at long last; but then we realized that to sing a full set, we\u2019d actually have to rehearse. Time was precious; we so rarely got together. So instead, we ate doughnuts and bagels at our host\u2019s apartment, and all of us took turns congratulating James-Allen about his big Broadway break.About an hour before we had to leave for the matinee, someone said we were going to sing, for ourselves, at least, and we formed a circle around the dining room table. It felt right that James-Allen led the way as pitch. For once, there was no fighting about the solos. As we sang, we looked around and around at one another, grayer \u2014 older, less color in our cheeks, and yet still somehow sounding so much the same.In an hour, at the theater, we would listen to the pros sing complex harmonies in the melodies James-Allen wrote; we would lean across the aisle to catch each others\u2019 eyes in pride at the high points. But for the moment, we sang our own hearts out, a bunch of amateurs, taking it all in, old enough to know we sounded good enough.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Populist Anger Rising, Italy May Be Next Domino to Fall", "Date": "2016-12-02", "News": "Supported byTURIN, Italy \u2014 Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, only 41, once seemed to have solved the riddle of how to survive Europe\u2019s populist, anti-establishment tempest. But with a critical national referendum on Sunday, the populist wave is now threatening to crush him and plunge Italy into a political crisis when the European Union is already reeling.From Washington to Brussels to Berlin, fears are rising that Italy may be stumbling into its own \u201cBrexit\u201d moment. What should be an inward-looking referendum on whether to overhaul Italy\u2019s ossified political and electoral system has taken on much broader import. Financial analysts warn of a potential banking crisis, and pro-Europe supporters fear that a \u201cno\u201d vote in the referendum could accelerate the populist movement across the European bloc.Mr. Renzi\u2019s supporters have taken to calling his opponents in the internet-born, populist Five Star Movement \u201cTrumpisti.\u201d They accuse their opponents\u2019 numerous blogs and websites of flooding the Facebook accounts of young people with anti-Renzi, pro-Russian fake news. The referendum has essentially become a referendum on Mr. Renzi, who gave extra motivation to his political enemies by vowing to resign if voters reject the proposed political changes.\u201cA \u2018no\u2019 vote is a vote against Renzi,\u201d said Matteo Roselli, 25, a liberal activist who spent a recent rainy evening in Turin handing out leaflets encouraging people to vote \u201cno.\u201dWith polls indicating that Mr. Renzi may fail, the possibility that he could resign, and force new elections or perhaps bring a caretaker government, has alarmed many leaders, including President Obama, who honored the Italian prime minister in his final state dinner in Washington and urged him to \u201chang around for a while no matter what.\u201dIf Mr. Renzi does step aside, it could open the way for opponents who have threatened to carry the Continent\u2019s fourth-largest economy out of the euro currency zone.Such a prospect could destabilize the shaky Italian economy; have serious implications for Italy\u2019s troubled banking system, which has been in crisis for a decade; and have a contagion effect around the eurozone.\u201cThe problem with Italian banks is they are fragile and they are really big,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cBanks of that caliber, as soon as you have any noise and rumors, it creates a really bad loop.\u201dMr. Renzi, who captured Italians\u2019 imagination by positioning himself as an outsider who would demolish an arthritic political system, is arguing that the constitutional overhaul proposed in the Sunday referendum would streamline government and create more stability in a country that has had 63 governments in 70 years. To speed up the often clogged legislative process, Mr. Renzi wants to drastically reduce the size of the Italian Senate and make it a mostly consultative body. Critically, the Senate would lose the power to bring down governing coalitions.The beneficiary of that erosion appears to be the Five Star Movement, with its ability to win voters on the left and right with a mix of social liberalism, economic populism and tough law-and-order talk. It has been led by Beppe Grillo, 68, a former comedian who last month called Mr. Renzi a \u201cserial killer\u201d and celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a blunt rejection of the establishment.In recent years, the merrily vulgar Mr. Grillo has stepped back so that a new generation of less rough, but perhaps no less radical, young politicians could step forward.Here in Turin, Chiara Appendino, 32, beat Mr. Renzi\u2019s favored Democratic Party candidate for mayor this year. In the election, she had the support of Mr. Roselli and many like him.\u201cOur voters are mainly young voters,\u201d Ms. Appendino said after stepping out of the chandeliered City Hall chamber. \u201cI believe there really is a generation of young people, and I feel in some way that I represent them, who have desire and ability, but who cannot get ahead.\u201dMs. Appendino, who speaks German, French and English and is considered a rising star in her party, said that she did not consider herself anti-European, but she argued that the current European Union did not work.Far from breaking with the establishment, Mr. Renzi had been co-opted by its bankers, bureaucrats and power brokers, she said.Mr. Renzi is desperately trying to persuade Italians, a large slice of them still undecided, to back him.\u201cToday, we mustn\u2019t get stuck in nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Renzi told a crowd this week in Lingotto, the section of Turin that was once home to the automaker Fiat. \u201cWe must work for the future of our children.\u201dBut even his young supporters worry that those words are wasted on the Italian youth, who as in so many other European countries are often unemployed.In France, where the far-right National Front has emerged as a force, the youth unemployment rate is around 25 percent. And that looks good compared with Greece and Spain, both with more than 40 percent youth unemployment and strong populist movements.In Italy, Mr. Renzi\u2019s 2015 labor market overhaul, hailed by many investors, has so far failed to be the boon to employment his government expected. The youth unemployment rate is still around 35 percent. In the country\u2019s south, where opposition to the change is solid, it is nearly 50 percent.\u201cThe young are lined up against him,\u201d Davide Giani, 20, said with a resigned shrug after an afternoon spent trying to hand out leaflets in support of a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the referendum only to see young Turinese turn them down. \u201cThey see this as an opportunity to lash out against the establishment.\u201dBack in the summer, Mr. Renzi predicted the gathering storm as he flew on the Italian Air Force One but nevertheless strained to see a silver lining in the unwrinkled faces of his new rivals.\u201cThe good thing is that since we have come to power, there has been a generational leap forward,\u201d Mr. Renzi said, adding that his likely opponents, Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini, the young leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Renzi Northern League, would be younger than he is. \u201cGreat!\u201d he said. \u201cA sign that something has changed.\u201dSome of Mr. Renzi\u2019s older enemies across the political spectrum are latching onto the referendum to return to relevance. For them, the prospect of his premature exit has had the effect of a curtain call after a bloody opera, reanimating vengeful antagonists for a final bow on center stage.Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 80, mindful that Mr. Renzi needs moderate center-right supporters, reversed his previous support for the constitutional overhaul out of sudden fear of \u201cauthoritarian drift.\u201dIn Turin, former Prime Minister Massimo D\u2019Alema, a member of Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party who has received little deference from the current leader, delivered a disdain-dripping speech to mobilize elderly liberals and former communists against the change.\u201cHe presents himself like the one who wants to rejuvenate the country, but the young people are against him,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alema, 67, said in an interview, in which he mocked Mr. Renzi as a Twitter-obsessed \u201coaf\u201d who had alienated labor unions and destroyed the left.Mr. Renzi\u2019s young supporters shudder at the very mention of Italy\u2019s former leaders. On a rainy evening in Milan, Alessia Giuliani, 24, sat in a field office for the \u201cyes\u201d campaign hunched over lists of phone numbers she had spent the day calling in support of Mr. Renzi\u2019s changes.She spoke optimistically about all the older people who, having lived through scores of Italian governments, proclaimed their hope and confidence in Mr. Renzi.But asked if she had had any luck persuading young people, her smile vanished and her hand landed woefully on her forehead.\u201cIn general, the young voters are disinterested or for \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d explained her colleague, Stefano Angelinis, 24. \u201cMany young people are going for Five Star.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The pictures accompanying Adger Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 essay in a new monograph on his work are not his professional photos, but snapshots from his personal life: his childhood home, a group portrait of his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatives in their Sunday best, and Mr. Cowans cradling his godchild. These pictures affirm the importance of photography not just in Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 life, but also in the lives of millions of African Americans for whom it was a way to show themselves as they wanted to be seen, and in marked contrast to the negative stereotypes they often confronted. But for Mr. Cowans, these informal images also underscore his understanding of the medium as personal, humanistic, and intimate.Mr. Parks was one of his most ardent admirers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOften such talent abides by rules set by others, but Adger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s individualism sets him apart, simply because he follows his own convictions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Mr. Parks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis photographs go far as imagery can go without actually speaking. Cowans has acquired the freedom to master himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cPersonal Vision\u00e2\u0080\u009d attests to Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mastery, featuring a broad range of photographic subjects: a raking overhead shot of a man protecting himself from a sudden rainstorm with a makeshift cardboard umbrella; the World Trade Center, shot with a slow shutter and transformed into a rush of tiny streaks of light; an abstract image of a contorted female model; a blissful Sarah Vaughn in song; the musician and activist, Josh White, guitar in hand and face radiating with joy; a mother in Suriname, seemingly lost in thought as she cradles her baby; and a reflective Spike Lee, taking a break from directing \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Daze.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.Mr. Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 admiration for these photographs is not surprising. Both men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work shared an important attribute: an appeal to empathy. The impact of Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 photographs resides in their ability to imbue images of street life or portraits, of everyday subjects or celebrities, with powerful emotional overtones. Whether depicting the impressionistic spectacle of people barreling forward in a snowstorm or the emotive faces of his subjects, mostly black but also white, Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lyrical images portray life as resonant with feeling. In doing so, he represents not only the parallel realities of our lives, but affirms that much of our existence, no matter our race or social standing, is inevitably the same. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is not just documenting an event; he is literally talking to the rhythmic heartbeat of your being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the photographer and writer Anthony Barboza observed of Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 photographs. Pulsing with the heartbeat of their subjects, these images make visible that which is often unseen: the complex humanity that defines each of us, making us far more similar than different.Mr. Cowans wrote that he was first moved by photography when he took pictures of poor children holding balloons. He had watched them longingly looking a street vendor, which moved him to buy them balloons. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I saw those images I understood the power of a photograph. The photos were not about being poor; they were about happiness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cowans recalled in the book. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe smiles on those faces made me understand how a photo could move people to see, think, and feel. It is important to give emotion to your work.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAllusions to the rhythmic in Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work, and his collateral interest in photographing abstract phenomenon, like ripples on the surface of water or the juxtaposition of diaphanous fabrics, not only highlights his desire to represent what is most abstract about human existence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our intangible and fleeting emotions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but also alludes to an earlier passion: music. Before he was a photographer, studying at Ohio University in the 1950s, Mr. Cowans was a musician, despite his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enthusiasm for picture taking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody in my family had a Kodak box camera and they loved to pose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother would make beautiful albums and I would spend many hours looking at relatives who have passed on, folks that lived far way, newborn babies, travels, favorite cats, dogs, horses, and life. Still I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interest in photography. I was more into music, and I really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I just wanted to play music.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs Mr. Cowans\u2019 interest turned to photography, it became central to his artistic practice, which also includes painting and printmaking. In the 1960s, he played an important role in the Harlem-based African American photo-collective, Kamoinge, and he later joined AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists), an influential artist collective founded in Chicago. Mr. Cowans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 production has been prodigious. In the end, through his art, he has explored the human condition, in ways both original and varied.  But as Tuliza Fleming, curator at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, noted about him, \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough his creative style and mode of expression has undergone many phases during his career, several important components of his work and aesthetic have remained constant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his incredible sensitivity to the soul of his subjects, his ability to stay in the moment, and capture that moment in his images; and, his uncanny ability to simultaneously reveal the seen and the unseen.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

{"Headline": "New York Today: A Smart Way to Park", "Date": "2016-12-20", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayUpdated, 6:30 a.m.Good morning on this shivery Tuesday.The Department of Transportation has been stepping up its parking game.The goal: to decrease traffic and to lower the number of New Yorkers who own and drive cars in the city, which is roughly 1.4 million. (That\u2019s a lot of honking.)This new technology, sadly, does not fix the biggest headache about parking in the city: finding a spot in the first place.But once you do find one, the app will at least keep you from having to sneak away from dinner to feed the meter, and there will be less of a need to carry around change. (The only jingle you\u2019ll hear around this time of year, we hope, will be sleigh bells.)It\u2019s still early, but we downloaded the app and are happy to report that setting it up was quite easy:Finally, get out there and park, enter your estimated timing and zone location number on your phone, and enjoy the day. And should your metered time run out while you\u2019re stuck in line at Trader Joe\u2019s, worry not; you can use the app to extend your stay.No need to be that person dashing down the sidewalk in despair.Here\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s still freezing.Then get out and run.Fortunately, temperatures will nudge past freezing.But only for a few hours this afternoon.Time to hit the books.After five years of construction, a new 32,000-square-foot library will open at noon today in Elmhurst, Queens.The installation, created by the New York-based artist Allan McCollum, is made up of nearly 1,000 plywood shapes that appear similar but, on closer examination, are all slightly different, representing the neighborhood\u2019s diversity and its vibrant immigrant community.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When people die, survivors search their images for a trace of life.  The day after Fidel Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memorial in Havana, two Cuban-born New Yorkers sat together, looking for him in a vast archive of photographs. We had been deluged by images of Fidel in the news media that showed him as icon, warrior, hero or tyrant. We were bombarded by the famous close-ups, the profile, the orator before vast crowds, the man apart. We wanted to see something different. In an office overlooking a rain-soaked Washington Square, Ramiro Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez and I immersed ourselves in his extraordinary Cuban photo collection. Amid a sea of Cuban faces, we finally reached the folder titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFidel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Scanning the 274 photos of Castro, we looked for the early every day of Cuba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Revolution and for a sense of how it all began.  The photographs did not disappoint.  A crowd surrounds a jam-packed bus in Havana.  In the nighttime commotion, something is unfolding. The bus is full to bursting and passengers hang out the window.  Some smile, as if they know they are part of something, though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure what. In the doorway, a big man wearing shades mugs manically.  Below him, a younger man, slim and dressed in drab with a military cap, stares steadily our way. His focused look alerts us. Looking back again, we finally spot him, the bearded man tipping back a soda.  It is 1959 and Fidel Castro sits inside the Route 28 Bus drinking a Coca Cola. He is in a crowd of Cubans, waiting for the moment of departure.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lived with these pictures a long time, and I rethink their meaning in times like these,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ramiro, 61, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe portraits of Fidel are part of an arc in a story, and I like that aspect, the way they help us recognize the curve in the road.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis collection \u00e2\u0080\u0094 amassed over the last 35 years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 aims to capture the vernacular and the commonplace of Cuban imagery, and his Fidel file is no exception.  The most constant revelation is recognizing Fidel among Cubans and not above them, mixing with people, forming part of a group.  In snapshots, candid photographs, even greeting cards, this Fidel belongs to something bigger than himself.  He is captured in ordinary, forgettable moments, not in political ritual. He is clearly a kind of political rock star, mixing with the people, but also, for a moment, just a man eating fruit on the side of the road with his comrade.  He does not loom over us, finger raised. He is not in epic profile.  His image is not yet a stronghold for the state. Fidel is caught in candid moments, surrounded, entertained, tired, relaxed, bemused.  We see droplets of water on his thick glasses as he talks to a man at a regatta; he bares his wavy hair (a rare sight) amid a crowd of wavy-haired women; he looks resigned to a group photo with salesgirls clustering around him. He is a face on a glittery greeting card, an image inset in a Christmas tree (before his government banned the holiday).  He is a postcard staring romantically at a mountain range, the Virgen de la Caridad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cuba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patroness \u00e2\u0080\u0094 superimposed above the peaks in kitschy religious splendor.  These images let us discover the ordinary and electric fervor Fidel aroused. The commercial improvisations, amateur crafts and the faded photographs attest to the political love Cubans shared with him and one another in the Revolution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want the quality of every day, and I love when I find an anonymous snapshot or a homemade greeting card that shows the primal enthusiasm that people felt for Fidel when he came,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ramiro said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom individuals to greeting card companies, they all felt free to circulate his image. That disappears as his leadership became more official and more somber. \u00e2\u0080\u009d As the Cold War raged, and Fidel became the embodiment of Socialist Revolution, the sign of a new and contested Cuban nationalism, his images stressed decorum, heroism, authority, and solitary power.  Ramiro and I searched that early archive for images that revealed something more vulnerable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s those real moments when the photographer caught something, a moment when he [Fidel] is not in control of the image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ramiro said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I find pictures and see something like that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really exciting.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRamiro Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez, who spent 25 years as a photo editor at Time-Life, bought his first photograph in 1981, when he was a receptionist at the Museum of Modern Art. It was a 19th century photo of two rows of royal palms along a road. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind of Cuban come to the light image,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, smiling. He has been collecting Cuban photographs and ephemera ever since, amassing an extraordinary and eclectic archive of roughly 6,500 photographs and objects, one of the largest outside Cuba.  The collection \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which documents Cuban history and Cuban image making from the 1850s to the 1980s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has been anthologized in two books, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI Was Cuba: Treasures from the Ramiro Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez Collection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Kevin Kwan and \u00e2\u0080\u009cCuba Then: Rare and Classic Images from the Ramiro Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez Collection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a foreword and poems by Richard Blanco. With his family history tied both to Cuba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 19th century independence wars and Fidel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beginnings, Ramiro brings a deep sense of Cuban memory to collecting.  His father, Ramiro Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez, founded the successful Milton pharmaceutical company in Havana; his mother hailed from Havana society and was part of the early Revolution. From exile in Miami, his grandmother regaled him with stories about Havana\u2019s Hotel Tel\u00c3\u00a9grafo and sparked an anxiety over lost memories. He is driven by personal taste and a trained eye, but also by a desire to rescue an endangered archive of memory. He chooses and preserves photographs in their damaged truth: water stains on a revolutionary portrait with Camilo Cienfuegos, Fidel and his young son Fidelito, folds in a tattered snapshot, writing on an image to mark a famous subject. For Ramiro, rescuing and preserving the hard life of photographs, their life as fragments, is part of the ethics of collecting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, many of these photographs sometimes seem like leaves in the wind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where many of these photographers are or what happened to them.  These are rescued children, these photographs.  Some are missing corners, credits, dates and names.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just the guardian.  I pull the children in from the storm.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRamiro remembers meeting Fidel as a child.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was in the neighborhood for a meeting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was small and he came to say hello to some of us children. He was huge, so tall. I remember the smell of cigars on his hands.  The scent of cigars and wet canvas, since it had been raining and Fidel always wore his green canvas fatigues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amid the revelations in Ramiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection are photographs of Fidel\u2019s childhood and of a young R\u00c3\u00a1ul Castro. A school picture show Fidel, serious at the center of a group, marked with an \u201cx\u201d by some unknown hand.  A very young R\u00c3\u00a1ul, the smallest in the group, smiles shyly in front of him. In a 1958 photo, taken while the rebels were in Oriente Province, R\u00c3\u00a1ul sits on a fender, smiling affectionately at Vilma Esp\u00c3\u00adn Guillois, who would become his wife. In crowds, he is in sharp focus at arm\u2019s length, but fuzzy up close. We think we detect a quality of chispa in the young gaze, a spark of wit and quickness, but reticence too, or a sense of reckoning.  Today, scanning the face of the most powerful man in Cuba, the photos of R\u00c3\u00a1ul seem to reflect the changing times and his growing power. As years pass, the shy smile appears less and less.Ramiro was 8 when he fled Cuba with his mother and sister on October, 29, 1960.  I was 4 when my parents left half their family in Havana on December 4, 1967, 49 years ago today.  Like millions of Cubans marked by the power and legend of Fidel Castro, we have spent our lives in his shadow, negotiating our relationship to his image.  As a generation, we have had to privately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even secretly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 imagine our relationship to Fidel, a figure fixed in family lore, in epic terms of good and evil, a figure in someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. At his death, without nostalgia or suspicion, we ask questions again:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was it like when it was ordinary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you love him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was it all back then?\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the years to come, and as a generation falls silent, we will have to reimagine the answers for ourselves. With Ramiro Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs and their everyday fragments of Cuban history, the work gets more complicated and more compelling.  On the day of Fidel Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burial in Santiago de Cuba, we think again about moments of departure, and wonder about the next curve in the road. "}
{"Headline": "Google Says It Will Run Entirely on Renewable Energy in 2017", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byMINCO, Okla. \u2014 Last year, Google consumed as much energy as the city of San Francisco. Next year, it said, all of that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels.The online giant said on Tuesday that all of its data centers around the world will be entirely powered with renewable energy sources sometime next year.This is not to say that Google computers will consume nothing but wind and solar power. Like almost any company, Google gets power from a power company, which operates an energy grid typically supplied by a number of sources, including hydroelectric dams, natural gas, coal and wind power.What Google has done over the last decade, with relatively little fanfare, is participate in a number of large-scale deals with renewable producers, typically guaranteeing to buy the energy they produce with their wind turbines and solar cells. With those guarantees, wind companies can obtain bank financing to build more turbines.The power created by the renewables is plugged into the utility grid, so that Google\u2019s usage presents no net consumption of fossil fuels and the pool of electricity gets a relatively larger share of renewable sources.\u201cWe are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world,\u201d said Joe Kava, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, good for business and good for our shareholders.\u201dUnlike carbon-based power, Mr. Kava said, wind supply prices do not fluctuate, enabling Google to plan better. In addition, the more renewable energy it buys, the cheaper those sources get. In some places, like Chile, Google said, renewables have at times become cheaper than fossil fuels.Whether Google is the largest buyer of renewables would be difficult to verify, as many industries do not release data on how much energy they consume. There is no doubt, however, that Google\u2019s large computer complexes, along with similar global operations by Amazon and Microsoft, are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing new consumers of electricity.Google hopes that success in working with large wind farms, like the 50,000-acre facility in Minco, Okla., which supplies Google\u2019s large data center in Pryor, Okla., will spur development of the industry. NextEra Energy, which owns the wind farm, has about 115 wind farms in the United States and Canada.About 25 percent of United States electricity goes to businesses, and companies like Google are now about 2 percentage points of that. Dominion Virginia Power, located in a state with perhaps the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, last year had a demand increase from those customers of 9 percent, while overall demand was nearly flat, according to Dominion.Google operates eight different businesses, including internet search engines, YouTube and Gmail, each of which has over 1 billion customers. They run on a global network of 13 large-scale data centers, each one a complex of many buildings containing hundreds of thousands of computers.The 5.7 terawatt-hours of electricity Google consumed in 2015 \u201cis equal to the output of two 500 megawatt coal plants,\u201d said Jonathan Koomey, a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences at Stanford. That is enough for two 140,000-person towns. \u201cFor one company to be doing this is a very big deal. It means other companies of a similar scale will feel pressure to move.\u201dIt moves the needle on costs to have a big consumer, Mr. Koomey added, since a larger market tends to allow for economies of scale and more innovation. \u201cEvery time you double production, you reduce the cost of solar by about 20 percent. Wind goes down 10 to 12 percent,\u201d he said.Facebook has entered into similar deals with wind producers. Last week, Amazon reiterated its long-term commitment to power its machines entirely with renewable energy, though for 2016 it expects to be above about 40 percent of its goal. It has announced five more solar projects.Microsoft says it has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2014, but much of this comes from the purchase of carbon offsets, which are investments in things like tree planting or renewables projects meant to compensate for the fossil fuels a company consumes. The company hopes to have half of its electric power supplied from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources by 2018. Its data centers currently use about 3.3 million megawatt-hours of power a year.Critics note that while Google might be adding wind and solar to the world\u2019s power grid, overall it is still dependent on fossil fuels, since sun and wind power are intermittent, while demand for things like YouTube cat videos is continual.\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s a P.R. gimmick,\u201d said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank in Washington supported largely by donations from individuals and companies in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf they think they can actually support themselves with wind and solar panels, they should connect them directly to their data centers.\u201dNext year\u2019s goal will be 95 percent accomplished with wind turbines around the world, Mr. Kava said, and Google\u2019s support for the industry could keep prices dropping, particularly relative to things like coal. \u201cWe\u2019re technology-agnostic, but we\u2019re not price-agnostic,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated title for Jonathan Koomey at Stanford. He is a lecturer in the school of earth, energy and environmental sciences, not a research fellow at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.Advertisement"}

And her reputation \u2014 among supporters, detractors and her prodigious online following \u2014 has been built on the commentaries with which she closes each show.During the presidential campaign, she became one of the most visible young supporters of President-elect Donald J. Trump, saying that she was using her show to speak for those who live between the coasts and \u201care too timid or too bashful or too busy to voice their own opinion.\u201d It is an approach that has made her a new media star, while also drawing the ire of critics who say her commentaries are often racist.\u201cThere were some people in the audience that were just there to razz me,\u201d she said afterward, adding that she did not think she persuaded anyone in attendance with her arguments. At one point, she compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan.\u201cPeople talked about it as if they were exchanging ideas and talking about beliefs \u2014 like they were debating sports,\u201d he said, asserting that Ms. Lahren\u2019s words \u201care literally life-threatening to black people.\u201dMs. Lahren has frequently denied being racist. In interviews with The New York Times last week, she condemned the fringe movement known as the alt-right, which espouses white nationalism and anti-Semitism, calling it \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and said she would never be \u201can advocate, a cheerleader or an apologist for the K.K.K. or any other hate group.\u201dIn the interviews, Ms. Lahren spoke about issues that inspire her. There are numerous military veterans in her family, she said, including a grandfather who was a paratrooper in World War II and an uncle who was awarded the Purple Heart during Vietnam. Ms. Lahren spoke passionately about the hardships of being a soldier and of being related to one.She does not call herself spiritual \u2014 \u201cSpiritual sounds like you worship the grass,\u201d she joked \u2014 but said she believes in God and prays every night and when she runs, often asking \u201cto be a better person.\u201d But she also blasted organized religion as being \u201cabout hierarchy, power, control and greed.\u201d Minutes later, she said, \u201cThe institution of religion is important.\u201d She is pro-choice and does not object to gay marriage.She curses regularly, and professes to love junk food and the rappers Pusha T and Kendrick Lamar. She enjoys argument as sport and, as evidenced by her appearance with Mr. Noah, can be a talented sparring partner.She testified to her authenticity \u2014 \u201cPeople like me because I\u2019m real\u201d \u2014 but said of Mr. Noah and herself, \u201cWe both know that we have to play these parts.\u201d She mocks liberal \u201csnowflakes\u201d as being overly sensitive to name-calling, but says she is bothered when people use the word \u201cretard.\u201dMs. Lahren says she is surprised when she meets black fans. Charlamagne Tha God, the host of the New York-based radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d is friendly with her. He does not think Ms. Lahren is racist, but \u201cmisinformed,\u201d he said in a phone interview. He enjoys her show, he said, identifying with Ms. Lahren\u2019s \u201cpolitical incorrectness.\u201d He stressed the importance of Democrats speaking directly to people like her.Still, he said, \u201cI have to remind myself that some of the rhetoric she puts out there is troubling.\u201dHe said that in a recent conversation with Ms. Lahren, he questioned what he saw as her contradictory views. For instance, when he asked why she supported Mr. Trump, given the bigotry of some of his supporters, she said that a few bad apples did not represent the movement.\u201cSo you have to have that same respect with the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d Charlamagne recalled telling her.Mr. Trump\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment.While Ms. Lahren, a fan of the radio host Howard Stern and the rapper Eminem, often seems to enjoy causing controversy, at other times she is more conciliatory. She expressed hope that \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d would show an unfamiliar side.\u201cI find that when people are actually around me, it\u2019s impossible not to like me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople expect me to be angry, bitter.

{"Headline": "We Don\u2019t Talk About \u2018Radicalization\u2019 When an Attacker Isn\u2019t Muslim. We Should.", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsWhenever a mass shooting or some other large-scale, incomprehensible attack occurs, the nation collectively holds its breath, waiting to see which set of cultural prejudices can be mobilized to frame the massacre. In the week before the election, when two officers from the Des Moines area were murdered in cold blood, a police spokesman may have gotten ahead of himself when he said that \u201cthere are some not-so-positive views of law enforcement that a certain segment of our population holds.\u201d What was probably being hinted at here was that the shooter had to be black and all worked up by the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 a presumption immediately squelched once the suspect was identified as Scott Michael Greene, a white local who had enjoyed engaging in racial incitement by waving a Confederate flag at a high-school football game.Radicalization. Once we have this word in hand, then we can sift the early news items for bits of confirming evidence, such as the suspect\u2019s suddenly adopting more religious clothes, or growing a beard, or visiting some far-off terrorist landscape. For Rahimi, we learned that he spent time in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where such an opaque process as radicalization could happen.Radicalization seems to mean something, the gist of which is this: that there is a knowable and coherent process, like a kind of matriculation \u2014 that moves a once-normal human being along some grisly progression until he or she is killing people. It\u2019s a sturdy box of a word filled with apparent meaning, yet when pressed upon to deliver the specifics, mostly collapses like cardboard.In current discourse, \u201cradicalization\u201d tends to limit unthinkable attacks to those carried out by anyone of Middle Eastern descent \u2014 but why? Micah Johnson, an African-American man in Dallas, murdered five police officers in the wake of new YouTube videos showing black citizens being fatally shot by the police \u2014 was he self-radicalized? Or Jerad and Amanda Miller, the white couple who joined the antigovernment protests at Cliven Bundy\u2019s ranch in 2014 before being asked to leave and then fatally gunned down a civilian and two police officers in Las Vegas \u2014 were they radicalized?Just what does it take to climb the staircase \u2014 especially to get to that last floor \u2014 when it suddenly makes sense to \u201csidestep inhibitory mechanisms\u201d and start killing people? The fact is, mass murder might be too complex a subject for a whiteboard.Some of the more restrained analysis, though, reveals unexpected ways to think about contemporary terrorism. Mark S. Hamm and Ram\u00f3n Spaaij break down terrorists into the ways they form. In their forthcoming book, \u201cThe Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism,\u201d they look at the solo attacker, like Jared Loughner (Tucson, 2011) and Omar Mateen (Orlando, 2016). Other studies might examine, say, cells of three or more, or pairs like the Millers in Las Vegas and the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston.Curiously, the trigger for lone wolves, Spaaij told me, was not only political but often personal. Not long before his cop-killing spree outside Des Moines, Greene had a fight with his mother, resulting in her getting a protective order against him \u2014 a break eerily similar to that of Richard Poplawski, the Pennsylvania man whose mother called 911 on him in 2009, leading to the murder of three Pittsburgh police officers.What often precedes these personal crises leading to violence, Spaaij said, is the \u201cenabler\u201d phase of radicalization, which can involve the killers\u2019 happening upon encouraging messages from faraway leaders. When Muslims are identified as the attackers, we often learn about their obsession with the droning sermons of online imams like Anwar al-Awlaki. In the radicalization of Poplawski, \u201cresearch shows that our discourse provides the environment that can enable terrorism,\u201d Spaaij said. \u201cHe had embraced this conspiracy theory that Obama would take away his right to bear arms.\u201d Spaaij cited conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, who promotes the idea that FEMA camps are being built as concentration camps for dissidents and the federal government is hatching plans to seize people\u2019s guns, as spreading the kind of degraded public discourse that lays the groundwork for action. Then, when violence occurs, \u201cthey can distance themselves and say that you cannot connect that with us because we don\u2019t advocate violence.\u201dThe study of terrorists\u2019 history suggests there is a relationship between these two forms of radical discourse. Distant authorities talking in a deniably cryptic way contribute to the rationalization for violence. This shift toward violence can have an effect at just about every level \u2014 from the lone-wolf killer, to couples, to hidden cells. And although it\u2019s a more esoteric field of study for policy-center professionals, radicalization of an entire nation is possible, too \u2014 typically after reckless innuendo from political leaders becomes acceptable and then routine.Jack Hitt is a writer whose most recent book is \u201cBunch of Amateurs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navy Opens a Back Door, and In Come Athletes and Victories", "Date": "2016-12-09", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessIt\u2019s been another good year for Navy football.Even after last week\u2019s loss to Temple in the American Athletic Conference\u2019s title game, the Midshipmen are 9-3, with victories over Notre Dame and Houston. They are favored to beat archrival Army on Saturday for the 15th consecutive year. And two days before Christmas, Navy will end its season by playing Louisiana Tech in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl, which has a payout of $600,000 per team.This season is not an anomaly. The United States Naval Academy may not be Alabama or Michigan, but it plays a serious brand of Division I football. Last year, the Blue and Gold went 11-2, soundly defeating the University of Pittsburgh in the Military Bowl ($1 million payout for each team). In 2014, the team was 8-5, including a one-point victory over San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl ($750,000 payout). Its 2013 record was 9-4, with a season-ending win ... well, you get the picture. The last time Navy had a losing season was 2011.But how does Navy do it? Aren\u2019t there height and weight restrictions that would limit the Midshipmen\u2019s ability to recruit the kind of athletes you need to succeed in Division I football? (There are.) Isn\u2019t the federal government stingy in giving tax dollars to the military academies for athletics? (It is.) Aren\u2019t the academies, charged with training the nation\u2019s military leadership, supposed to maintain their admissions and academic standards even if it means passing on football players? (Yep.) And aren\u2019t Naval Academy graduates required to put in five years of military service after graduation, which would seem to preclude attracting athletes with pro potential? (Yes again.)\u201cFootball is a polite and unarmed version of warfare, played as though there\u2019s no second place.\u201d He added: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re a small school, our players are usually smaller, too. But we\u2019re very physical, very disciplined and approach every game with the urgency required to win a battle.\u201dThere is some merit to both rationales, but I\u2019d also like to suggest a third possibility: Navy\u2019s gaming the system.By the late 1960s, NAPS had opened its doors to civilians. This was partly a diversity effort, but it was also a way to get in the children of alumni or politicians who didn\u2019t have the grades or SAT scores to be admitted into the Naval Academy directly from high school. Once in NAPS, which is tuition-free, students were essentially guaranteed a spot in the Naval Academy the next year. According to a Naval Academy spokesman, Cmdr. David McKinney, the prep school costs taxpayers around $14 million a year.In the 1980s, Navy noticed that the Air Force Academy, which was regularly trouncing it in football, was placing recruited athletes in its prep school. Indeed, in 2003, Fisher DeBerry, the longtime coach of the Falcons, told The Colorado Springs Gazette that the prep school \u201chas had a major impact on the success of our football team.\u201dEager to turn the tide against its rival, Navy began to copy DeBerry\u2019s methods. Sure enough, NAPS is now a means by which Navy launders underqualified athletes into the Naval Academy.Jim Kenney, a retired Navy captain who was the commanding officer of the Navy prep school from 1978-82, recalled that in his era maybe four football players had been enrolled. \u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cit is dominated by athletes.\u201dIn addition to a free education, the Navy gives NAPS students $1,000 a month.Ordinarily, this would be a violation of N.C.A.A. rules. Because NAPS students are being paid for being in the military, the N.C.A.A. has granted a waiver allowing the stipend. (The same is true at the Air Force and Army prep schools.)What was NAPS like for the athletes? The athletics were intense, and the academics none too stressful, recalled Peter Banos, who played basketball there in 2008. \u201cThere was all sorts of tutoring,\u201d he said, \u201cbut really, it was like another year of high school.\u201dBanos added: \u201cWe had cars, we could visit friends, and we were flush with cash. It was high school kids getting paid.\u201d And if, after a year at NAPS, a student decided not to go the academy, the Navy didn\u2019t ask for its money back. Banos left the Naval Academy after his freshman year.The Naval Academy said that many NAPS athletes go on to succeed at the academy and in the Navy. Three former Navy football players from the class of 1998, all of whom went through NAPS, are in important command posts seeking terrorists.Let\u2019s dwell on this for a second. Imagine if some Ohio State boosters paid to send recruited athletes to a private prep school for a year before they went to the university. It would be an out-and-out scandal \u2014 exactly the kind of booster bribery the N.C.A.A. wants to stamp out. Yet, once again, the military academies have been given a waiver by the association.Those height and weight restrictions I mentioned earlier? They are waived for athletes \u2014 at least until their eligibility is used up. At that point, those 280 pounds that made a Navy lineman so valuable to the team become a huge liability. They are suddenly under tremendous pressure to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds, depending on their height. And if they don\u2019t \u2014 or simply can\u2019t \u2014 their careers suffer, and sometimes end prematurely.As for that required five years of military service, there once was a time when even the best Navy athletes had to put in time after graduation before going on to a professional career. Roger Staubach, who won the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 1963, didn\u2019t join the Dallas Cowboys until 1969. His Navy tour included a year in Vietnam.Recently, athletes good enough to become professionals haven\u2019t had to put in five years of military service. In May, the secretary of the Navy granted waivers to four Navy athletes, allowing them to play while serving in the Reserve. They included Keenan Reynolds, last season\u2019s quarterback, who is now with the Baltimore Ravens, and Joe Cardona, who is the long snapper for the New England Patriots.And it doesn\u2019t just finance the athletic department. It runs it. The N.A.A.A. employs and pays the coaches. (Navy\u2019s football coach, Ken Niumatalolo, makes $1.6 million.) It manages the stadium. It negotiates the media contracts. And it rustles up sponsors. In all, Navy\u2019s athletic budget is over $40 million, in the same range as the budgets at Hawaii, Boise State and New Mexico.Are the compromises Navy makes to remain competitive in big-time college football any worse than other Division I schools? Not really. But that\u2019s not the point.The military academies do something critical for our nation: They \u201ctrain and educate junior officers in the Navy and Marine Corps,\u201d said Barry Relinger, a Naval Academy alumnus. \u201cThey should be dedicated to that purpose and not trying to achieve greatness of Division I sports.\u201dNo one is saying sports shouldn\u2019t matter at the Naval Academy. The Navy believes that sports can build character and imbue leadership qualities that are important for officers. I\u2019m not going to disagree.But to its critics, the gamesmanship required for the Naval Academy to be able to play football competitively with the likes of Notre Dame has hurt its ability to turn out the best officers possible.\u201cI think competition is very important,\u201d said David Tuma, an alumnus who has long been critical of Navy athletics. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be in Division I to stir the competitive spirit.\u201dOn Saturday afternoon, the annual Army-Navy game will be a hard-fought, patriotic spectacle. It will be fun to watch. Would we feel any different about it if the two schools didn\u2019t park athletes in their prep schools? If the linemen weighed 230 instead of 280? If they were in Division III instead of Division I? I doubt it.If only the Navy believed that.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of consecutive years Navy will have beaten Army if Navy wins Saturday. It is 15, not 14. The article also misstated Roger Staubach\u2019s year at Navy when he won the Heisman Trophy. It was his junior year, not his senior year.Advertisement"}

Others are gold and boost the treble. The companies producing them can go from obscure to white-hot overnight.Enormous growth has taken place for headphones priced from $99 to $500. But companies like HiFiMan, Audeze and JH Audio have built substantial businesses selling headphones that retail for as much as $3,000.A guide for the audiophile and the casual listener, from Beats to Sensaphonics.Alexander Wang and Proenza Schouler are collaborating with brands like Beats and Master & Dynamic on limited editions. Canali teamed with Pryma. Barneys, Neiman Marcus, Colette and Opening Ceremony all stock headphones.\u201cFor Sennheiser, it\u2019s product placement and an indictment,\u201d Mr. McBurney said.Did they mind?\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.The paradox of the headphone experience \u2014 which somehow brings together, as Mr. McBurney suggested, isolation and intimacy \u2014 did not seem to be on the mind of Val Kolton, 39. A sports-car-obsessed techno fanatic, he founded a headphones company in 2004, naming it V-Moda because \u201c\u2018moda\u2019 means fashion,\u201d he said, and all his favorite brands were Italian.\u201cPrada, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was really into motorsports. Lamborghini, Ferrari, Ducati.\u201dBefore starting his business, Mr. Kolton was living in San Diego and working at Aviatech, a digital marketing company. Then he had an awakening on a dance floor in Ibiza, Spain.\u201cWe were doing antismoking commercials, and I heard we were going to do another for Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\u201d Mr. Kolton said one evening this fall, as he sat on a black leather sofa in his West Hollywood offices. \u201cAnd I was having a drink and a smoke, and I thought: \u2018You know what? Why am I doing all these \u201canti\u201d campaigns? What\u2019s next? An antisex campaign? Dance music is going to break through. House music is here!\u2019\u201dTwo years later, Mr. Kolton\u2019s parents gave him money to produce candy-colored $99 earbuds. At the time, Apple was scheduled to release the first iPhone, with a recessed headphone jack that was incompatible with most headphones on the market.Mr. Kolton got the bright idea of manufacturing his line to Apple\u2019s market-busting specifications. He flew to Cupertino, Calif., and made the pitch. He figured he would be one of many entrepreneurs with Apple in mind, but that was not the case.The market got more crowded after Beats by Dr. Dre, founded by Andre Young, known as Dr. Dre, and the music producer and executive Jimmy Iovine, introduced its first $300 headphones in 2008.\u201cThirty years ago, when someone said, \u2018I want to make a headphone,\u2019 he would probably try to make it here in the United States, or he might design it and then get on a plane and say to the people who make headphones in China: \u2018Here\u2019s the design. Can you execute it?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve eliminated the first two steps. The requirement, quote unquote, is that the person who\u2019s running the show knows what it should sound like and look like and feel like and is able to say, \u2018Keep showing me your samples until I find it.\u2019\u201dBy the time Jonathan Levine, 54, a former investment banker at Lehman Brothers, started the headphones company Master & Dynamic in 2014, it was clear that design and marketing were key.Mr. Levine settled on the brand name Master & Dynamic because it sounded similar to established audio brands such as Bang & Olufsen, Astell & Kern, and Bowers & Wilkins. \u201c\u2018Levine\u2019 didn\u2019t exactly scream luxury,\u201d he said.To get out the message for his 1950s-inspired, produced-in-China headphones, with its cognac-colored headband, he hired Carolina Clouet, a Balenciaga-clad former consultant for Barneys and Neiman Marcus, as his director of sales.In October 2014, Bergdorf Goodman, Opening Ceremony and Colette received the first shipments of Mr. Levine\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the $399 MH40. In December of that year, Mr. Levine\u2019s team sent them as freebies to Art Basel Miami Beach attendees at the Edition hotel and the Standard Miami.\u201cNobody has made a fashion headphone that\u2019s in-ear,\u201d Will.i.am said by phone while on a break from taping the British edition of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all big headphones that sit over your head. The reason we went with earbuds is because we were designing it to be like jewelry.\u201dThe countless options can be paralyzing to customers. The writer and radio host Kurt Andersen said he had trouble picking the right headphones as he perused CNET\u2019s exhaustive review section recently.\u201cI like that the over-the-ears are not as dorky as they once were,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones from Beats seem fine. But then do I look like someone trying to be young, with groovy, hip-hop headphones?\u201dA challenge for the industry is getting women interested in its high-end gear. Amy Uaarmorn, a 31-year-old staff member at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, received a free pair of Master & Dynamic MH40s last year. Yet she said she seldom wears them and cannot imagine spending any more than $50 or $100 on headphones.Some of the ultraexpensive headphones are made to fit your ear exactly. To get a pair, you see an audiologist, who takes impressions of yours ears using a Play-Doh-like substance and ships them off to a manufacturer like Noble Audio.This variety, known as CIEMs (short for custom in-ear monitors), started with touring musicians, who use them to block ambient noise and monitor their own sound.The trend really took off when JH Audio, a big player in this area, began posting photos of its famous customers and their CIEMs on Facebook and Instagram.But even as the boom shows no sign of abating, there are those who, like Ms. Uaarmorn, have no interest in spending hundreds or thousands of dollars for a perfect listening experience.Julie Klausner is also sticking to the basics.\u201cApple earbuds,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really need anything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fake News Brings a Gunman to Washington", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byEditorial NotebookOn Sunday afternoon, as families ate a late lunch at Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C., a man armed with a rifle walked in, aiming to \u201cself-investigate\u201d fake stories that the small pizzeria was a front for a child sex ring led by Hillary Clinton.No one was hurt, but a shot was fired, families and staff fled and a swath of the quiet neighborhood was locked down for hours. The suspect, 28-year-old Edgar Welch of Salisbury, N.C., referenced what\u2019s known online as \u201cPizzagate,\u201d a fabricated story on dozens of fake news websites, which puts Comet Ping Pong at the center of bizarre, debunked charges of child trafficking. The hoax has been shared millions of times by Donald Trump supporters on social media including Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.In the days before the election, General Flynn\u2019s Twitter account bristled with all-caps exclamations about bizarre Clinton conspiracy theories. On Nov. 2, General Flynn tweeted: \u201cU decide \u2014 NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc...MUST READ!\u201d He included a link to a fake story on a website called \u201cTrue Pundit.\u201d Two days later, he tweeted a link to another false story, accusing John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chief, of participating in satanic rituals. This, from the man who would guide the United States\u2019 first response to global threats?Comet is owned by James Alefantis, an artist and restaurateur who has never met Hillary Clinton. Mr. Alefantis was once in a relationship with David Brock, a Clinton ally, that ended five years ago. Pizzagate appears to have roots in the WikiLeaks release of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails, one of which referred to plans for a Clinton fund-raiser that involved Mr. Alefantis.For a month, Comet\u2019s owner, 40 employees, even musicians who have performed there have been receiving phone calls and online messages by people threatening to kill them and burn down the business. Photos of the children of Comet customers have been lifted from social media pages and used in made-up stories of child abuse and trafficking.Comet is a favorite of families: Its pizza has gotten national plaudits, and it has crafts projects for antsy kids to work on. It has Ping-Pong tables and a small concert stage in the back. It\u2019s located in a leafy neighborhood that\u2019s home to government types and members of Congress, who frequent Comet, too. Until now, about the only controversy surrounding Comet were gripes about loud music, or Ping-Pong balls rolling into Connecticut Avenue during warm summer nights when the tables were set up on the sidewalk outside.Recently the police ejected a person who was videotaping Comet patrons and workers during dinner. Last week, Mr. Alefantis announced that police and security guards would patrol the concerts. He tried to reassure patrons that the threats against him and his business were just an online phenomenon. Now, thanks in part to Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, fake news just got real.Mr. Trump says he disavows hate campaigns by his supporters. Now that we\u2019re seeing the real-world impact of phony theories spread by General Flynn, does \u201cdisavow\u201d mean reconsidering his choice of the general as national security adviser?Advertisement"}

It turns out the relationship with the TV show is stronger.That\u2019s how closely connected politics and culture can be.In the 1960s and \u201970s, even if you didn\u2019t watch a show, you at least probably would have heard of it.  Now television, once the great unifier, amplifies our divisions.This reflects the business of television as much as it does a fracturing national culture. In the past, notes James Poniewozik, the chief television critic for The New York Times, big network shows like \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d \u201creflected a business where sheer audience numbers were more important.\u201d Now, advertising money is driven less by volume and more by demographics. You make more ad money, Mr. Poniewozik explains, by appealing to younger, more affluent, urban viewers.Still, there are shows that find broader appeal. We\u2019ve created a fandom map for each of the top 50 shows, ranked in order of the difference between their highest and lowest fan percentages. As you get deeper in the page, you\u2019ll find the shows with more consistent popularity \u2014 points of unity in a splintering culture.Men with long beards and Christian values center the most geographically divisive show in the data set. \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d a reality show on A&E, follows the over-the-top lives of a Louisiana family that makes the Duck Commander duck call.It is the prototypical example of a show that is most popular in rural areas. The correlation between fandom and the percentage of people who voted for Mr. Trump was higher for \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d than it was for any other show.\u201cNCIS\u201d is a police procedural on CBS about a team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Similar to \u201cCriminal Minds,\u201d another police procedural, it is most popular in rural areas.\u201cThe Voice,\u201d a singing competition, is most popular in North Dakota and least popular in New York. It was behind only \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d and \u201cFast N\u2019 Loud\u201d in its correlation with Trump voters.\u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Comedy Central\u2019s news satire and talk show, typically has a politically liberal point of view. It\u2019s most popular in cities and other more liberal-leaning areas along the coasts. Peak popularity is in San Francisco; it\u2019s least popular in Alabama.\u201c106 & Park,\u201d on BET, used the classic radio countdown formula to showcase hip-hop and R&B music videos. The show was canceled in 2014, but it remains a popular digital-only brand. The show is popular in the Black Belt, generally. You can also see an increase in the show\u2019s popularity on Indian reservations in South Dakota and Arizona, a pattern that repeats itself in several of the maps.\u201cModern Family\u201d is an ABC mockumentary about an extended and blended Los Angeles family. Jay Pritchett\u2019s family includes his much younger second wife; his cerebral stepson; his two neurotic adult children, one a gay man with a family of his own; and their spouses and children. The show has won many Emmy Awards over its eight-season run, including for outstanding comedy five seasons in a row.Its audience pattern is the prototypical example of a city show \u2014 most popular in liberal, urban clusters in Boston, San Francisco and Santa Barbara, Calif., and least popular in the more rural parts of Kentucky, Mississippi and Arkansas.\u201cFamily Guy\u201d is an animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane that sends up American culture. Like many satirical comedies on our list, it is most popular in cities. The show\u2019s popularity was more correlated with support for Hillary Clinton than any other show.Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cTosh.0\u201d subjects viral internet videos and other aspects of pop culture to the snarky commentary of the comedian Daniel Tosh. It\u2019s very much a Northern show, but not necessarily an urban one. It is most popular in Colorado; least so in Mississippi.\u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d is a comedy that follows the life of four socially awkward but brilliant young scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif. The show is most popular in central Iowa \u2014 particularly Ames, home to Iowa State University \u2014 and University Park, Pa., the home of Penn State.\u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d which has run for 28 seasons on Fox, is set in the fictional town of Springfield (in an unknown state). Of all of the Springfields in America, it is most popular in Springfields in Virginia, Minnesota and New Jersey, and least popular in Springfields in Louisiana, Arkansas and Georgia.\u201cSouth Park\u201d is an animated sitcom on Comedy Central that is not for children. The show revolves around four foul-mouthed fourth-grade boys in a small Colorado town, and it\u2019s that state where it\u2019s most popular.\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is an HBO fantasy drama set in a quasi-medieval period of swords and sieges. The show is full of treachery, murder, nudity, sex, dragons and, yes, zombies. It\u2019s much more popular in cities than it is in the countryside, probably the only show involving zombies that is.Flesh-eating zombies, called \u201cwalkers,\u201d pursue the still-alive characters of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d across the South. Now in its eighth season, the show is most popular in rural areas, particularly southern Texas and eastern Kentucky.\u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d is the third and most popular installment of Bravo\u2019s \u201cThe Real Housewives\u201d franchise. It follows the sometimes outlandish lives of several black women.\u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d is more popular in cities than in the surrounding countryside. It gained a reputation this past election cycle for being less politically minded than other late-night programming.Danny DeVito is one of the gang in \u201cIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\u201d an oddball and satirical sitcom set in South Philadelphia. It\u2019s generally more popular in college towns (and most popular in Philadelphia).\u201cFast N' Loud\u201d is a reality show set in the Gas Monkey Garage, with the crew searching for run-down cars to restore. It\u2019s the show most favored by men on our list, by far \u2014 83 percent of \u201clikes\u201d came from men \u2014 and it is also one of the most Trumpian, second only to \u201cDuck Dynasty.\u201d While the Gas Monkey Garage is located in Dallas, the show is most popular in the area around the city, rather than in Dallas itself.\u201cThe First 48\u201d is a documentary series that follows big-city homicide investigators in the first days after a killing. It has a classic Black Belt audience pattern.\u201cCriminal Minds\u201d is a police procedural drama on CBS involving the F.B.I.'s Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico, Va.

It\u2019s most popular in areas that are rural, cold and close to the sea, particularly Alaska and Maine.The long-running \u201cAmerica's Funniest Home Videos\u201d on ABC features humorous homemade videos submitted by viewers. If you could pick a safe show that appeals to almost everyone, this might be it.\u201cGrey's Anatomy\u201d is a long-running medical drama series on ABC, with reruns on the Lifetime network. The doctors and staff play around, fall in and out of love, struggle with personal demons and somehow find time to treat sick people. It has also elevated many an actor and actress to movie stardom during its 11-year, and counting, run. It\u2019s most popular in a swath of the middle of the country, particularly in areas with a lower percentage of college graduates.\u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d on the E! cable network follows the Kardashian-Jenner family. It has been keeping up with Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and the others since 2007. The show tends to be most popular in areas with large Hispanic populations, particularly in the Southwest.\u201cBones\u201d is a crime procedural drama on Fox. Its twist: Each episode involves forensics on decomposed bodies. It\u2019s most popular in areas scattered around the West Coast, and tends to be less popular in places with large nonwhite populations.\u201cRob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory\u201d on MTV is a reality series following Mr. Dyrdek\u2019s life running a giant  warehouse designed for skateboarding. The map is very similar to that of \u201cRidiculousness.\u201d\u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d is set in New York. Like the original \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d from which it was spun off, episodes often take inspiration from real crimes. The pattern of the show\u2019s popularity is atypical: generally slightly more popular in rural areas and the Black Belt, but largely restricted to the eastern half of the country. It\u2019s most popular in Albany, N.Y.; least in Colorado and Utah.Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d is a cartoon series that is safe for children and that has wide appeal.The West Coast seems to relish \u201cAdventure Time,\u201d a quirky animated series on Cartoon Network that works on an adult and child\u2019s level. It is the most popular show among the young in the data \u2014 just over two-thirds of \u201clikes\u201d come from viewers ages 18-24.Each season of FX\u2019s often-disturbing \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d  tells a story involving witches, ghosts or monsters. Unlike a lot of shows about the supernatural, it\u2019s more popular in cities, but also throughout parts of the Southwest.\u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d was a reality series on MTV that followed pregnant teenage girls. Each episode featured a different high schooler dealing with the challenges of looming single motherhood. Similar to \u201cTeen Mom,\u201d it is more popular in rural parts of the country.\u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d is another dance competition show, this one on Fox. It was created by the same people who made \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the musical talent show. In general, it\u2019s more popular in cities, though it hits peak popularity in Utah.\u201cPretty Little Liars,\u201d with lots of kicky fashion, is a teen drama loosely based on a teen book series. Its popularity is tilted toward women more than any other show in the data \u2014 over 94 percent of \u201clikes\u201d come from women.\u201cCake Boss,\u201d a reality series on the cable network TLC, takes viewers inside Carlo's Bake Shop in Hoboken, N.J., owned and operated by Italian-American siblings. But the audience is generally not urban; in fact, one hot spot is Appalachia.\u201cWipeout,\u201d which ran from 2008 to 2014, was a game show in which contestants tried to complete a race requiring them to do things like swing over flames or avoid falling into murky water. It\u2019s most popular in Northern, rural areas with a large percentage of whites: Idaho, Utah, Wisconsin and Maine are all on the top of this show\u2019s list.In \u201cSupernatural,\u201d two brothers pursue a never-ending procession of demons and other otherworldly things. It exhibits a nonurban white audience pattern.\u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d is another animated sitcom created in part by Seth MacFarlane. Dad is a Republican C.I.A. agent; he has a hippie daughter and a dorky son. It is not popular in Utah or much of the South.A series of short cartoons starring the animated adversaries Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse, was first created in 1940 by the prolific team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. In 2014, the Cartoon Network revived \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d as a series. It has that rare appeal for all three groups of Americans.ABC\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d takes place in a fictional Maine town where residents are characters transported from classic fairy tales \u2013 Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin, etc. It\u2019s most popular in Utah and eastern Idaho, where Mormons are populous.\u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d very loosely based on a memoir by Piper Kerman of her year at a low-security prison, features a minority-rich ensemble cast. But it appeals more to a white audience.\u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d is based on a book series for adolescents and young adults. A teenage girl becomes involved with vampires in a small Virginia town full of supernatural beings. As with several other shows that focus on the supernatural, it\u2019s slightly more popular outside of cities. That said, the show\u2019s fandom has the smallest amount of spatial variation of all 50 shows.Find which cultural bubble your town or city falls into by using this handy tool:An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the occupation of Olivia Pope, a character on \"Scandal.\" She is an independent consultant in Washington, D.C., not a White House aide.Advertisement"}

Israel wrested the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including the Old City, in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and defense minister, said it was Mr. Netanyahu who had failed to make any distinction between building in East Jerusalem and the settlement blocs close to the 1967 lines, which Israel expects to be able to keep under any peace agreement with the Palestinians.\u201cThe principal enemy of the settlement blocs and the Jerusalem neighborhoods is Netanyahu himself,\u201d Mr. Barak, an increasingly vocal critic of Mr. Netanyahu, said on Israeli television on Saturday night.Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the right-wing, pro-settlement Jewish Home party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, goaded Mr. Netanyahu to respond with more drastic measures, like annexing parts of the West Bank to Israel. \u201cThe time has come to transition from withdrawals to sovereignty,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementDecember  8, 2016Tony MarcanoRitchie TorresWhen I first heard about the Department of Housing and Urban Development's proposal for a smoking ban in public housing a few months ago, I recoiled in disgust.  At a time when the New York City Housing Authority is sinking deeper and deeper into a state of disrepair, why, I thought to myself, would the federal government spend even a second on a small-bore smoking ban, knowing, as it surely must, that public housing is an endangered species with far more pressing needs.The need for tobacco control aside, I am under no illusion that the New York City Housing Authority, which confronts a growing capital need of $17 billion and counting, has either the wherewithal or the will to enforce a smoking ban.   But the mere presence of a ban, even if lightly enforced, could have an impact: Public housing would likely have fewer smokers with a ban in place than it would in the absence of one, and fewer smokers would mean more people with longer and better lives.  If lengthening and improving lives is not a worthwhile cause, then I am not sure what is. \nI hate smoking. Among all the terrible things we do to our bodies \u2014 injecting narcotics, ingesting  toxic pills and alcohol, consuming too much sugar and salt \u2014 there\u2019s little worse than sucking poison into your lungs. It would follow, then, that I would approve of the coming ban on smoking in public housing announced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t reconcile a government ban on a legal product, even noxious tobacco, in the privacy of one\u2019s own home. That\u2019s a difficult admission for me. I spent the first 20 years of my life as an asthmatic whose parents smoked in a cramped apartment in the James Monroe Houses in the Bronx. My father, who inhaled at least three packs a day, died of heart disease in his mid-40s.So no surprise that I\u2019m okay with vigorous campaigns to discourage smoking. Those graphic ads with images of jaws eaten away by cancer or smokers breathing through tracheostomy tubes? All for them. Heavy taxes on tobacco? Absolutely. Indeed, I support smoking bans in common areas, and H.U.D.\u2019s plan to offer smoking-cessation aids and counseling to public housing residents.But I draw the line at the threshold to their apartments, and I believe public housing residents will too. We had no shortage of scofflaws in the projects back in my day \u2014 more than a few ignored a ban on dogs \u2014 and I suspect plenty will literally blow smoke at this one. Certainly, smoking bans can and do work. Legislative bodies have voted to impose them on entire cities, and state and federal health and safety laws effectively prohibit smoking in workplaces. Co-op boards and homeowners\u2019 associations frequently vote to ban tobacco. As The Times article notes, \u201csome 200,000 homes already come under smoking bans adopted voluntarily by hundreds of public housing agencies around the country.\u201dVoluntarily is the key word there. I would wholeheartedly back any smoking ban mandated by public housing residents either by direct vote or through legislation passed by accountable elected officials. I\u2019m aware that a public comment period on the H.U.D. plan indicated support for the ban, but the purpose there should be to inform elected officials of community concerns. It should not sanction regulations that punish, rather than treat, addiction and target low-income people.By all means, visit the homes of your neighbors, friends and families to warn them away from the scourge of smoking. But don\u2019t let the government into their homes to do it for you."}

New treatments don\u2019t always work, and experiments have risks. The patients I met are here to tell their stories because they\u2019re among the lucky few, the successes. Still, the cancer landscape does seem to be brightening, if only just a bit, in large part thanks to immunotherapy, which includes various treatments that help the patient\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer.Ms. Ryan is an engineer and database programmer, and to her scientific mind, it seemed highly unlikely that more chemo would control the disease. Chemo made her sick the first time around, and she had every reason to belief it would do so again. She and her husband, who is also an engineer, agreed that she should forgo chemo and instead try to tap into a major research center for help.\u201cI remembered that I had read about another cancer patient, Melinda Bachini. It stuck in my brain,\u201d Ms. Ryan said. \u201cI found out about this trial she did, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do.\u2019\u201dShe was accepted into the study, and got very lucky. Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team found that she had a type of cancer-killing immune cell that could destroy her tumors without harming normal cells. The researchers multiplied those cells in the lab and dripped more than 100 billion of them back into her. Ms. Bachini\u2019s tumors melted away.Inspired by Ms. Bachini\u2019s story, Ms. Ryan called the cancer institute. She was deferred twice because her tumors were not big enough to yield enough immune cells. But she persisted, and even sent the researchers screen shots from her scans, with measurements of tumors that she and her husband thought met the trial criteria. Eventually, she was accepted into the study and, like Ms. Bachini, was one of the fortunate ones: Now, thanks to the cell treatment and surgery, she is cancer-free.Ms. Ryan\u2019s case made medical history, because it was the first time researchers found cells that could attack a common cancer causing mutation \u2014 a finding that may help thousands of other patients with the same mutation.In November 2015, after the first scan showed that her tumors had shrunk markedly, Ms. Ryan tracked down Ms. Bachini and emailed her. \u201cCall me!\u201d Ms. Bachini replied. Ms. Bachini and Ms. Ryan have been friends ever since and stay in touch by phone and on Facebook.\u201cWhen Celine and I connected, I was so unbelievably happy for her,\u201d Ms. Bachini said.They hope to meet in person, maybe by coordinating their checkups at the cancer institute. Both try to help other patients who are looking for help and considering clinical trials.\u201cI spend a lot of time talking to patients, doing cancer advocacy stuff,\u201d Ms. Bachini said. \u201cIt\u2019s how I can pay it forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With a full slate of films headed to the big screen in the next few months, here\u2019s a look at notable trailers.Otherwise, \u201cFifty Shades Darker\u201d seems to take everything people liked and loathed about \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d and double it. Meaningful glances are everywhere. Some scenes in the trailer are a little more suggestive, though there might be a public indecency law broken in one of them. Even the wooden dialogue is back. (Although perhaps more self-aware; the first line of the trailer, \u201cI want you back,\u201d feels like a plea from the producers.)Even the music is the same. The trailer for \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d was set to a slower, spookier remix of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy in Love.\u201d Not to be outdone, this trailer brings in the R&B star Miguel for a breathy, hauntingly sexy cover that\u2019s just distinct enough to merit notice.And hey, why not? The music worked last time.Not the trailer for \u201cLogan,\u201d released in October, which sweeps all mentions of X-Men or Wolverine under the rug.Instead, it suggests a post-apocalyptic western. Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of \u201cHurt,\u201d a song about pain, provides the through line, connecting all the shots of a weary, older Mr. Jackman. The once-invulnerable Logan is shown alone, backed by dusty deserts and rusting equipment. He\u2019s battered, bloodied and wizened. It\u2019s Wolverine, by way of Clint Eastwood.The trailer positions Logan as a Wild West outlaw, making a break from the superhero genre. When antagonists appear, they arrive in a caravan of police cars. One character even wears a cowboy hat and poncho. So by the time Logan finally unsheathes his claws, toward the trailer\u2019s end, it\u2019s a jarring tonal break from what seems like a quieter, smaller film.April 28After that, Mae attends a keynote address delivered by a Circle leader, played by Tom Hanks, who stands in front of the company logo and wears a dark sweater that looks like the love child of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s hoodies and Steve Jobs\u2019s classic turtlenecks. He speaks about the power of technology, luring us in with his \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d voice, while Mae and her colleagues attend meetings and take selfies. \u201cSharing is caring,\u201d they chant emphatically. It\u2019s a sharp contrast from a real-world discussion about whether that\u2019s actually true. (Oh, hey, don\u2019t forget to share this column on Facebook!)The dark turn is inevitable, even without our current conversation about technology in 2016. So the trailer adds to the drama with a slowed- and stripped-down cover of the Hall & Oates song \u201cPrivate Eyes.\u201d A voice chants over piano, \u201cThey\u2019re watching you,\u201d drawing audiences further in with a foreboding warning about both the story onscreen and what might be happening off.The \u201cSnatched\u201d trailer, released in December, finds the right balance. It\u2019s certainly joke-dense. From the start, it establishes Ms. Schumer\u2019s character in an embarrassing breakup scene that brings her comedy chops to the forefront. Then it zips along to her mother\u2019s home, where Ms. Hawn awkwardly comforts Ms. Schumer with a hug that immediately establishes the uneasiness in their relationship. The trailer ushers them to South America with a quick conversation that further explains who they are: a young woman trying to find herself and a mother mired in routine.As the trailer introduces more plot elements \u2014 a man, the titular snatching, the escape \u2014 it keeps the jokes coming with a remarkable narrative economy. Plus, it gives equal time to Ms. Schumer and Ms. Hawn, suggesting both women will be making memorable returns to the big screen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "British Villagers Are Baffled by Flocking Chinese Tourists", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byKidlington JournalKIDLINGTON, England \u2014 The Chinese visitors fanned out of a tour bus, and suddenly stopped, transfixed, as if marveling at the Venus de Milo or the Eiffel Tower. Then they began photographing an unremarkable 1970s suburban home, an oak tree, a rosebush and a garbage bin.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Liu Jingwen of Guangdong Province said as one of her travel companions crouched with his camera on the edge of a lawn and took a selfie in front of a small red brick bungalow. A porcelain schnauzer smiled from a nearby window. An angry passer-by yelled: \u201cNo photos! We\u2019ll call the police!\u201dThe sudden influx of Chinese has also grabbed headlines and spawned a national mystery.Why, for example, do the Chinese tourists ignore the village\u2019s handsome 13th-century church and its thatched-roof cottages, preferring instead to peer through windows, film parked cars and traipse on the lawns of Benmead Road, a humdrum and modern residential street? One tourist asked a stunned resident if he could help mow her lawn. (She politely declined.) Another jumped joyously on a child\u2019s trampoline in the front yard.Others suggested that the Chinese had been drawn by Kidlington\u2019s claim to being one of the largest villages in the realm. Or perhaps they wanted to see the Kidlington mansion previously occupied by Richard Branson, the shaggy-haired billionaire?Ask a Kidlington resident why anyone, nevermind someone from as far away as China, would want to come here, and you will be invariably greeted with a look of dumbfounded amazement.\u201cWhy the Chinese come here is one of those unfathomables,\u201d said Liam King, 73, a telephone engineer who was raking leaves in front of his house on Benmead Road.\u201cThere is nothing wow-wow here,\u201d added Sanjay Aslam, 43, a driver, noting that Kidlington had long lived in the shadow of Oxford University.\u201cIt\u2019s just a regular village, quite a nice place, no riffraff walking around,\u201d offered Polly Bonney, a hairdresser.Kidlington has had its moments. A history of the village notes that in 1937 three Siberian wolves escaped from the local zoo, causing great panic. And in 1987, the chairman of the parish council touched off a revolt when he tried to turn the village into a town.The consensus at the pub was that the Chinese guests had unintentionally helped the anonymous village gain international attention, and were good for the local economy. Ms. McGrath said Chinese tourists occasionally entered the pub, ordered Guinness, pulled a face and left. \u201cThe Chinese have put us on the map,\u201d she said.In point of fact, there is a perfectly logical explanation for why droves of Chinese tourists are coming to Kidlington, and it is hardly going to burnish the local reputation.He added that some wily tourists had figured out that buying tickets at the palace would cost only about $25, and were secretly sneaking there on foot, irking other tourists, who had already paid full price. As a result, he said, those who opted out of the Blenheim tour were being dropped in Kidlington, which is not within walking distance.Mr. Sun stressed that the Kidlington phenomenon was also an outgrowth of modern China and globalization. Many tourists are a part of China\u2019s rapidly growing middle class, many of whom live in anonymous concrete tower blocks in huge cities, he said. They are enchanted by the village\u2019s tranquillity and intrigued by daily life in the English countryside.\u201cThe environment in the countryside in China isn\u2019t so great,\u201d he said, noting that it could be run-down and gritty compared with England\u2019s typically bucolic atmosphere. \u201cIn Kidlington, the environment is great. You see farm fields and ranches here. Also, many newly built houses here have brick or brick-and-wood structures, which you no longer see very often in urban China.\u201dAs a tourist bus pulled out of town, a group of Chinese visitors waved from their windows, smiling widely. The Kidlington tour had lasted about 15 minutes, but that was more than enough for Ms. Liu.\u201cIt\u2019s so romantic,\u201d she said, looking dreamy eyed.

{"Headline": "With LinkedIn, Microsoft Looks to Avoid Past Acquisition Busts", "Date": "2016-12-08", "News": "Supported byThere are ample reasons to be skeptical that the deal, the biggest by far in Microsoft\u2019s history, will pay off.First, the company has not had a great track record with this sort of thing. Two of Microsoft\u2019s largest acquisitions \u2014 the digital advertising firm aQuantive and the mobile unit of Nokia \u2014 were disappointments that eventually led to the company writing off nearly the entire value of the deals, more than $13 billion in all.\u201cMergers go on anyway, even though there\u2019s not much evidence they work out,\u201d said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cEverybody believes they are going to be different.\u201dStill, the Microsoft of 2016 is different from the unfocused giant of the past that lurched from deal to deal with wild-eyed ambitions of catching rivals like Google and Apple. It has a new chief executive who has made a series of smaller deals that have shown positive results. The company\u2019s stock is trading at record highs.In a joint interview shortly before their deal closed, Satya Nadella and Jeff Weiner, the chiefs of Microsoft and LinkedIn, described how they intended to make the acquisition work, where many before had failed. \u201cIn this case, this is the most substantial, big M&A that Microsoft has done in its history,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cSo the stakes are absolutely high.\u201dA key difference in the way Microsoft has approached the deal is the degree of independence it plans to give LinkedIn. It will not weave LinkedIn, which is based in Silicon Valley, into one of its existing product lines, nor will it treat it like a disconnected business. Mr. Weiner will remain LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive.\u201cNeither one of us is a Pollyanna,\u201d said Mr. Weiner. \u201cWe both know that acquisition integrations are challenging.\u201d\u201cI absolutely think of LinkedIn as our Instagram,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.Both men said that expanding the business of LinkedIn, which has more 470 million members, was what they cared most about. Microsoft will use its sales and distribution muscle to do just that.The company\u2019s executives on Thursday will outline plans to integrate the professional identity people have on LinkedIn with Microsoft Outlook and the rest of the Office suite. LinkedIn members will be able to draft r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in Word to update their LinkedIn profiles.\u201cSatya said starting literally on Day 1 the first priority is growing LinkedIn,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cThat if LinkedIn continues to grow its membership, if it continues to realize its mission, its vision, if it continues to grow the business, that\u2019s going to create value for Microsoft.\u201d\u201cI had to read it at least twice,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cI did a bit of a double take.\u201dMicrosoft and LinkedIn have spent much of the last six months \u2014 as the proposed deal went through regulatory reviews \u2014 getting to know each other.In a series of meetings the companies called \u201clearning days,\u201d teams of Microsoft employees from the Seattle area flew to LinkedIn\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley to talk about what\u2019s going on with Microsoft research, engineers, sales and other areas. LinkedIn employees flew to Microsoft to do the same.About 10,000 LinkedIn employees will join Microsoft. David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has done studies on LinkedIn and Microsoft, said one of the greatest challenges in making the deal work would be retaining talent.\u201cCritical in any merger of this type is, it\u2019s made a lot of people very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they stay?\u201dMr. Weiner, for one, said he was committed to LinkedIn.\u201cI\u2019m in my dream job, and the combination with Microsoft provides that much more opportunity to realize what it is we set out to do here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For many, the decision on whether to change their names carried significant weight, and it was shaped by the traditions, the norms and, in some cases, the laws of the societies in which they live. Some looked to their names as badges of cultural identity, others as symbolic links to their fathers that they were eager to preserve, or to sever.Here are some of the responses. They have been edited and condensed.\u201cMy husband had no family. He graduated college before we even met. He walked across a stage for his degree with no family or friends in attendance. He was the first (and only) person in his circle to complete college. When our son was born, after he filled out and signed the birth certificate, he looked at me and said, \u2018And then there were three.\u2019\u201d\u201cI have a long Spanish surname, which marked me as different growing up in an otherwise homogeneous white Anglican rural area in Australia. My name was hard to pronounce, hard to spell. I used to blush every time a new teacher tried and failed to pronounce it out loud. But after a few years, I became strangely proud of my surname and it was firmly part of my identity.\u201cEvery time now that someone struggles to pronounce it, it links me to memories of my school years, as well as to the story of my family (most of whom I never met) who fled as refugees to a new and safer country.\u201dKatherine Ruiz-Avila, who grew up in Australia and now lives in Delhi, did not change her name.\u201cQuebec law requires that spouses keep their name. There was no decision to be made. Some women in Quebec use their husband\u2019s name after marriage in social settings. However, I will continue using my own name.

She took her partner\u2019s surname.\u201cMost importantly, it is out of a deep respect for my mother. When I was 8 years old, my mother made the decision to take her maiden name back. This was in the 1970s. We lived in a small town in northern Maine, and she wrote for the local paper. She received harassing phone calls and harsh objections from family and friends. People even wrote in to the paper about it, stating that she was not a \u2018good Christian woman.\u2019 People made harsh comments to me about it as well.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementDecember 12, 2016Tom MillerTimothy JostThere is, of course, still work to be done, premiums and cost-sharing are too high for many and some marketplace enrollees have a limited choice of insurers, but we are heading in the right direction.  Criticisms of the A.C.A. extend well beyond those issues. More fundamentally, opponents are rightly skeptical of the federal government's growing role in their personal health care choices. Unless high-risk pools are funded at much higher levels than Tom projects, they will leave seriously ill people without access to coverage or care.  And why segregate individuals with costly health needs in underfunded high-risk pool ghettos rather than reinsuring their costs \u2014 as Republicans did for the Medicare prescription drug program?Finally, why turn the task of covering the uninsured back to the states, which failed for decades to find solutions while the uninsured numbers climbed?  And how can we pretend to turn health care decisions over to consumers who simply cannot afford health care?\nThe important points about the distribution of A.C.A. coverage gains relative to health and income are that its intricate cross-subsidy rationales were premised on two goals: One, getting a large enough group of younger, healthier, and somewhat higher income individuals to pay more for marketplace coverage than what it is worth to them; and two, enrolling millions of lower income individuals in expanded Medicaid who would be much less expensive to insure than those in the marketplaces.This didn\u2019t work out as planned. The Obama administration learned that it could not coerce, subsidize and tax enough people and businesses to reach its goals. Different policy choices are needed to address problems of affordability for low incomes, and they should extend far beyond premium subsidies alone.  Incentives to encourage more labor force participation, higher wages and more robust economic growth; along with increased market pressure to pay less for care that is overpriced and less necessary, would be good starting places. We agree, however, that the solution to at least part of the problem of making health care more accessible and affordable for lower income Americans is economic growth, and, I would argue, a more equitable distribution of the benefits of that growth.  We would certainly agree that more needs to be done to hold down constant increases in the cost of health care, and perhaps that more needs to be done to address the social determinants of ill health and poverty.  Tom contends that they can be covered with fixed-dollar tax credits, health savings accounts and high-risk pools.  I am skeptical, but in any event it is clear that producing these alternatives would take some time \u2014 probably several years.  Regulations would have to be written, federal programs and procedures established, and state laws and regulations changed.  It is essential that Congress take the time to thoroughly explore the issues raised by this debate and not proceed precipitously until a way forward is clear.  Lives are at stake.\nSo, there may be some signs of light at the end of this dim policy tunnel after all. Let\u2019s try to remember that neither party nor its allies get everything they want. We should move carefully and thoughtfully in any new policy directions. Experience suggests that\u2019s more of a hope than an expectation. Nevertheless, A.C.A. critics should remember the harsh lessons of what efforts to push through complex policy changes by any partisan means necessary ended up producing not long ago."}
{"Headline": "Looking for Holiday Cheer? Look Elsewhere", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerBeing a largehearted fellow with a deep and abiding faith in humanity, the Haggler likes to take the days between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day and look back at the warmth and good cheer he encountered in this column over the past 12 months.So he did that.It took four seconds.Because when he browsed through the episodes of 2016, he found many tales of companies behaving badly. In some cases, very badly. The year was like every other in the Haggler\u2019s career of interventions on behalf of consumers. Moments of reconciliation were rare. Moments of enlightenment even rarer.Which is to say that if you\u2019re in the mood for uplift, dear readers, try a forklift. What follows is an update to some of the standout examples of shouting and agita as we once again look back at a year in haggling.The real William Swenson, who does not have a Facebook account, seemed somewhat amused by the misuse of his image and biography. His father, less so. After the Haggler helped get the attention of Facebook, the company took down a particularly stubborn \u201cWilliam Swenson\u201d account. But Swenson the elder said that for months afterward, he was battling with Facebook over other William Swenson-inspired accounts, some of which used a photograph of his son receiving the Medal of Honor from President Obama. He spent three weeks, for instance, needling Facebook to take down a Devoe Swenson William page.\u201cI have 72 pages reported and removed so far,\u201d he wrote to the Haggler in October. \u201cThere are several other clearly bogus pages, without photos, but I know I have to live with that.\u201dMr. Fox\u2019s many victims may wonder how, exactly, he will ever earn $45 million. Good question. According to reports, he said in court that he wanted to take computer classes in prison, and start a new business when he is released, then use profits from that venture to make restitution.The Haggler doesn\u2019t see what could possibly go wrong with this plan.But the nonprofit had dealt with IDC Servco in September, or at least it had dealt with a man named Jim Snodgrass, who said he was with IDC Servco. What was really going on here? In a brief phone call with the Haggler, Mr. Snodgrass said that the company\u2019s lawyer would explain. That never happened, and the mystery endures.But the Haggler learned a few days ago that he wasn\u2019t the only one scratching his head. On Dec. 19, an agent of the Secret Service, which was involved in the IDC Servco indictments, contacted the Haggler in search of contact information for the nonprofit that was overcharged by the company. This was the first time law enforcement had sought out the Haggler\u2019s help. It made the Haggler feel useful, in a novel way.If this leads to more news, the Haggler will share.Around that time, the company was unveiling an update to its Android version of Apple Music. For the next three months, the Haggler tried it out. On one level, he is pleased to report, it was an improvement. There were no more dropped or duplicated songs, for instance.But it was still buggy. By month No. 3, it was nearly always necessary to restart the Haggler\u2019s smartphone to launch Apple Music. Which gets old.In short, the streaming service may no longer be stoned. But like a lot of recovering drug users, Apple Music is not exactly reliable.Since November, the Haggler has been happily using Spotify. When you write with complaints in 2017 \u2014 and by all means, please do \u2014 it will be playing in the background.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Standing Up to a Strongman", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byThis protest was one of many that have taken place recently across the Philippines and by Filipinos around the world. A week earlier, thousands spontaneously flooded the streets as news of the burial emerged. Further protests have swollen into the tens of thousands. More are scheduled, despite President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s vocal commitment to the Marcos family, whom he has said contributed to his election campaign.\u201cYou can\u2019t bury the truth,\u201d a placard read. \u201cHistory has its eyes on you,\u201d said another. In unison, the crowd chanted a slogan that dated from the days of the Marcos regime: \u201cMarcos! Hitler! Dictator! Lap Dog!\u201d A life-size cardboard coffin bobbed over our heads, and people thrust plastic shovels in the air and repeated: \u201cExhume him!\u201dThe heads of activist groups and civil society organizations took turns on stage delivering speeches or leading chants. One speaker continued to read out the placards, to cheers. Some were straightforward: \u201cHere; Lies Marcos,\u201d or \u201cMarcos no hero!\u201d Others were in the language of millennials: \u201cSwipe left Marcos.\u201d One proudly read: \u201cTemperamental brats\u201d \u2014 which is what Mr. Duterte\u2019s communications chief had called those who protested against the Supreme Court\u2019s split decision, earlier in November, to allow Marcos a hero\u2019s burial.For better or for worse, Mr. Duterte has wedded his presidency to the Marcos family. He consistently excuses the long dictatorship as justified. He has also endorsed Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who is seeking a recount for his vice-presidential race, which he lost in May.Mr. Duterte\u2019s supporters, backed by an army of trolls, continuously flood social media with attacks and fake news \u2014 revising Wikipedia pages about the Marcoses, accusing opponents of destabilizing the country, and working to suspend Facebook accounts of journalists and online groups who dissent.The recent protests show that many Filipinos are standing up against that.What\u2019s been surprising, however, is the engagement and anger of millennials, many of whom were criticized during the election for supporting the unsuccessful vice-presidental attempt by Mr. Marcos \u2014 who had run, strategically, with Miriam Defensor Santiago, an outspoken senator whose presidential bid was immensely popular with young voters. Yet now it is this new generation in an old fight against the Marcoses.Many placards at the protest targeted the dictator\u2019s heirs. \u201cSandro stupid,\u201d one read, referring to the 22-year-old grandson who defends the dynasty on social media. Another sign referred to Imee Marcos, the deceased president\u2019s eldest daughter, now currently governor of his home province of Ilocos Norte. \u201cThe Botox of Imee,\u201d it said, \u201cis the money of the nation.\u201dSuch mockery has prompted criticism from those who defend the foul language of the current president. But these young protesters are doing more than following Mr. Duterte\u2019s pugnacious lead. They are using wit and creativity to stand against a powerful enemy, fully aware of the history of violence they are up against.Marcos is alleged to have been responsible for tens of thousands of human rights abuses \u2014 a good majority against students and young activists. Imee was found by an American court to have been complicit in the torture and murder of Archimedes Trajano, a student who in 1977 stood up to question her in a public forum for her appointment as national youth leader. This bloody tradition now extends to the Marcos family\u2019s powerful ally, Mr. Duterte \u2014 who has said that questionable journalists \u201care not exempted from assassination\u201d and recently warned that human rights activists would be killed if they obstructed his violent war on drugs.In the Philippines, the abuses of the dictatorship loom like trauma in the national psyche, and Mr. Duterte is squandering his political capital by walking in their footsteps. After thousands of extrajudicial killings and some questionable foreign-policy decisions, his complicity in rewriting the Marcos legacy is a step too far for many Filipinos. An increasing number of Mr. Duterte\u2019s allies have begun criticizing him, and top members of the National Historical Commission recently resigned over the decision to move Marcos\u2019s body.Yet it\u2019s not just history that protesters are seeking to defend. It is also the immediate future. The president has lately been considering suspending habeas corpus. Martial law is now spoken of with serious consideration, even though our Constitution allows it only in the event of insurgency or invasion. What was once a slippery slope is becoming a perilous pit.Across the street from the rally, a counterprotest was staged by a group of roughly 20 people, mostly men. They stood at the foot of the monument to Jose Rizal, our national hero who stood against Spanish colonialism but cautioned against violent revolution. They raised their fists in the salute popular among Duterte supporters and held out a banner that declared: \u201cDuterte Youth supports our strongmen of Asia: President Rodrigo Duterte and President Ferdinand Marcos.\u201dI spoke to one of the young men. He was articulate, thoughtful and clearly concerned about our country. He assured me that martial law would be used only if entirely necessary. One of his companions also told me: \u201cThe protesters shouldn\u2019t be dividing the nation.\u201dThere\u2019s no denying that the Philippines is more divided than ever. But who is really to blame? We must constantly ask who gains from that division. It certainly hasn\u2019t been anyone but those who seek power, or seek to retain it. Now the vanguard against them is these young protesters, concerned about the country they will inherit.The rains stopped as the protest permit expired. Teenage girls unfurled black garbage bags and picked up litter. Throughout the evening, elderly activists who had survived the Marcos dictatorship told the crowd that in their old age only now they felt assured, because a torch had been passed.One of the last speakers requested that all the lights be extinguished. He asked everyone to turn on their cellphones and raise them high. The crowd \u2014 thousands strong \u2014 became a new galaxy, unrecognized constellations. \u201cYou are the light in the darkness,\u201d he declared.Then he led us all in a Marcos-era chant in Tagalog, pertinent again for a new generation: \u201cStruggle! Do not be afraid!\u201d Then our voices united for one more: \u201cPeople of the nation! Now is the fight!\u201dMiguel Syjuco, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of the novel \u201cIlustrado\u201d and a professor at N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi.Advertisement"}

No one imagined it would take half a century.Now the site is finally being rebuilt, the result of a 2012 agreement reached between the city and the various factions. Named Essex Crossing, the 1.9-million-square-foot project will deliver shops, restaurants, a movie theater, a museum and 1,000 units of housing, half of them permanently affordable.With the first affordable housing lotteries scheduled to begin this summer, Ms. Guzm\u00e1n says it is time to come home. So she and local activists have been searching for neighbors from long ago. But finding people after a decades-old diaspora is difficult \u2014 people die, or forget childhood addresses. Lives take unexpected turns.\u201cYou may not want to come back if you\u2019ve lived in the Bronx for the last 40 years or you live in Florida,\u201d said Harvey Epstein, a lawyer who has advised some of the site\u2019s former tenants.But Ms. Guzm\u00e1n, now 55 and living in Campos Plaza, a public housing complex in the East Village, does want to come back. Because she lives on $15,300 a year in disability income, though, she does not meet the income requirements. Essex Crossing\u2019s affordable apartments are available to New Yorkers earning from 37 percent to 165 percent of the area median income \u2014 or $23,495 to $104,775 a year for a single person. Ms. Guzm\u00e1n argues that the city has a special obligation to her, regardless of her income. \u201cI just feel that they should accommodate us,\u201d she said.A few weeks ago, I met with her in the East Village. In her hands, she held a yellowed letter from the city, dated July 1978. The typed words were faded, but their meaning was clear. Her mother, Carmen Guzm\u00e1n Torres, \u201cshould have a priority to return to the area,\u201d the letter read.\u201cI know she wanted to come back. She wouldn\u2019t have saved this letter if she didn\u2019t,\u201d said Ms. Guzm\u00e1n, whose mother died in 2009. \u201cIt makes me sad.\u201dMs. Guzm\u00e1n describes leaving the neighborhood as \u201ctraumatic\u201d and \u201cone of the most difficult moves of my childhood.\u201d Her family bounced from New Jersey to East New York in Brooklyn and, later, to Sunset Park in Brooklyn, \u201cwhere we found some semblance of stability,\u201d she said.James Yolles, a spokesman for Delancey Street Associates, said in a statement that the developer is working \u201cto develop a list of those who identify themselves as former site tenants.\u201dThe city, however, is not trying to locate former tenants, nor will it provide housing subsidies for them should their income not meet the minimum requirement. \u201cWe are not actively seeking residents,\u201d said Juliet Pierre-Antoine, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Instead, \u201cWe are going to have them come to us.\u201dSo the task of finding people falls on the shoulders of people like Harriet Cohen, the chairwoman of the Seward Park Area Redevelopment Coalition, a community group commonly referred to as Sparc. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re the guardians of the site tenants,\u201d Ms. Cohen said.Edward Delgado, a member of Sparc whose family was displaced from the site when he was 15, found a childhood friend from the neighborhood on Facebook. But she lives in Alaska. Now 64 and nearly blind, Mr. Delgado doesn\u2019t live far from his old home, but he misses long-demolished shops. There was the bodega on Clinton Street where he worked as a delivery boy and met the girl who would one day become his wife. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we lost our apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like we lost our home, our community.\u201dHe might apply for an apartment in Essex Crossing \u2014 he struggles to climb the stairs to the fifth-floor walk-up he shares with his wife, Maureen Kelly Pyne. \u201cI would love to go back,\u201d he said.Advocates for the former tenants argue that the city owes a special debt to them, despite a citywide hunger for affordable housing. \u201cTheir commitment to those tenants didn\u2019t expire,\u201d Mr. Epstein said.At one point in the early 1970s, Ms. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s mother received word from the city that the family could soon return to the Lower East Side. \u201cWe packed our furniture and were happy to move back,\u201d Ms. Guzm\u00e1n said. \u201cFor a whole year, we lived out of boxes\u201d waiting for final word.

{"Headline": "New Mothers Derailed by Drugs Find Support in New Hampshire Home", "Date": "2016-12-11", "News": "Supported byROCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 The young women, soon to be mothers, gathered around a big kitchen table, chatting excitedly about due dates and baby names and even morning sickness.But these were not typical expectant mothers. They had used opioids, mostly heroin and fentanyl. Many had been incarcerated. Few had families they could turn to for help, and the fathers of their babies were out of the picture.Most of these women \u2014 tough, sassy, vulnerable \u2014 were destined to go through their pregnancies in a shelter, jail or even on the street, fending for themselves as they had often done before.Instead, here they were last week, in the cozy kitchen of a classic 1856 New England farmhouse where the aroma of fresh-baked cornbread filled the air. Set before them was a comfort lunch of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.Hope on Haven Hill, financed by $480,000 in federal funds and more than $150,000 in private donations, provides a safe, supportive environment where eight women who are either pregnant or newly postpartum can live while receiving comprehensive treatment and counseling for substance use disorders. Their days will be highly structured, with group therapy, private counseling, childbirth classes, life skills coaching, recovery support services and enrichment programs. Medicaid will reimburse Hope on Haven Hill for the services.Because opioid users are vulnerable to relapsing after they deliver, the women can stay at Hope on Haven Hill for up to a year after giving birth. If they have other children under 5, those children can live here, too. This is part of Haven Hill\u2019s philosophy of keeping mothers and babies together and alleviating the widespread fear among pregnant drug users that if they seek help, their children will be taken away.New Hampshire has two other small facilities for pregnant women with substance use issues. But as the opioid epidemic has worsened, both have long waiting lists.The need is growing, as evidenced by the sharp rise in the number of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, in which the newborn suffers withdrawal from the mother\u2019s drug use.In 2000, the syndrome was diagnosed in 1.5 babies per 1,000 births in New Hampshire; by 2012, that rate had soared to 15 babies per 1,000 births, said Dr. Bonny L. Whalen, a newborn pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.The rate now, she said, is even higher.Emma Lee, a tiny infant born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, was the first baby to arrive at Hope on Haven Hill on opening day last week. She had spent all 32 days of her life in a neonatal intensive care unit because her mother, Amanda, 31, who was homeless for the first six months of her pregnancy, had used heroin for most of that time and then went on methadone.At birth, babies like Emma Lee suddenly lose their opioid supply. Some go into withdrawal and require methadone or morphine to control their symptoms until they can be weaned off.\u201cHer withdrawals were pretty severe,\u201d said Amanda, who did not want her last name used, as she cradled Emma Lee in their sunny bedroom at Hope on Haven Hill. While in the hospital, the baby had difficulty eating. Her hands and legs shook with tremors.\u201cIt was really hard as a mom to see your new baby go through that,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cI know for myself, I know what it feels like to withdraw, and it\u2019s pretty terrible to imagine a tiny helpless baby going through that.\u201dHope on Haven Hill does not accept active drug users. Most of the women have only recently stopped using opioids \u2014 in New Hampshire these days, that usually means heroin and fentanyl. But they cannot detox, because going through withdrawal causes dehydration and increases the risk of miscarriage or of the mother\u2019s self-medicating with opioids to stave off the painful effects of withdrawal. So most of these women are on some kind of medication assisted treatment, either methadone or buprenorphine, which is marketed as Suboxone or Subutex.Erica Vallee, 24, who is five months pregnant, is among those at Hope on Haven Hill on Subutex. She has used heroin since she was 18 and has been in and out of rehab and jail. She says becoming pregnant was \u201cthe only thing\u201d that made her stop using illegal drugs.But like others here, she is afraid of relapsing.\u201cI can\u2019t be left alone because I don\u2019t trust myself,\u201d she said as she scrubbed the dishes in the kitchen sink after lunch.The hope is that the stable, nurturing environment of Haven Hill will provide enough support and encouragement for these women to maintain their sobriety.Dr. Arnold, who owns the Haven Hill house, planned the program with Kerry Norton, a prenatal nurse with whom she worked at a nearby women\u2019s health center. About two years ago, the health center started seeing more and more pregnant women with addiction issues who were not being treated for one reason or another.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have prenatal care,\u201d said Dr. Arnold, an obstetrician and gynecologist. \u201cThey\u2019d show up at the birth center and deliver and have nothing, and their child would be taken out of their custody and they\u2019d be out on the street again.\u201dAmong those who showed up at the health center was Abi Lizotte. She was homeless, pregnant and had been using heroin for at least six years, after her older sister had died from an overdose. Ms. Norton, whose own son had overdosed around this same time, took an interest in her, but Ms. Lizotte skipped appointments and Ms. Norton could not find a treatment program that would take her.\u201cI\u2019m an educated nurse who knows the system, and I couldn\u2019t navigate it,\u201d Ms. Norton recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018What is everyone else doing?\u2019 And it blew my mind when I realized what everyone else was doing, which was dying.\u201dIn June 2015, after a lengthy and exhaustive struggle, Ms. Norton got Ms. Lizotte \u2014 by this point eight months pregnant \u2014 into treatment in Nashua. That night, Ms. Norton, an insomniac, went home and took to Facebook, where she asked if anyone knew Ellen DeGeneres or Oprah Winfrey or anyone rich enough to establish a treatment program for pregnant women derailed by drugs.Dr. Arnold, a fellow insomniac, wrote back: \u201cI don\u2019t know Ellen and I don\u2019t know Oprah, but I have this house and I\u2019ve wanted to do this same thing for three years now.\u201dThe two started brainstorming and conceived the plan for Hope on Haven Hill. They credit Ms. Lizotte, now 24, sober and the mother of a healthy boy, as their inspiration.Since then, they have overcome mounds of red tape, secured the home\u2019s financing and achieved nonprofit charitable status. In September, Dr. Arnold moved her family \u2014 her husband, two children, two dogs and a cat \u2014 to a smaller home while workers renovated the Haven Hill house to meet the building codes for a residential center. Workers refinished the wide-plank pine floors, and volunteers came in with buckets of paint as new furniture, beds and linens arrived.After a ribbon-cutting ceremony last week, Timothy Rourke, the chairman of the New Hampshire Governor\u2019s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, said in an interview that while there was much to celebrate, it was important to remember that the state is in the middle of a crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at a death rate that is way too high and wait lists that are way too long, and many people are asking for help that doesn\u2019t come fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cHope on Haven Hill should be a call for all of us to do better.\u201dIts doors barely open, Hope on Haven Hill already has a lengthy waiting list of its own.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hacked Yahoo Data Is for Sale on Dark Web", "Date": "2016-12-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Some time around August 2013, hackers penetrated the email system of Yahoo, one of the world\u2019s largest and oldest providers of free email services. The attackers quietly scooped up the records of more than 1 billion users, including names, birth dates, phone numbers and passwords that were encrypted with an easily broken form of security.The intruders also obtained the security questions and backup email addresses used to reset lost passwords \u2014 valuable information for someone trying to break into other accounts owned by the same user, and particularly useful to a hacker seeking to break into government computers around the world: Several million of the backup addresses belonged to military and civilian government employees from dozens of nations, including more than 150,000 Americans.No one knows what happened to the data during the next three years. But last August, a geographically dispersed hacking collective based in Eastern Europe quietly began offering the whole database for sale, according to Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity firm, who monitors the dark corners of the internet inhabited by criminals, spies and spammers. Three buyers \u2014 two known spammers and an entity that appeared more interested in espionage \u2014 paid about $300,000 each for a complete copy of the database, he said.Mr. Komarov said in an interview on Thursday that his company obtained a copy of the database and over the last few months alerted military and law enforcement authorities in the United States, Australia, Canada, Britain and the European Union about the breach. After those parties verified the authenticity of the stolen records, he said, some of them went to Yahoo with their concerns.InfoArmor did not go to Yahoo directly, Mr. Komarov said, because the internet giant was dismissive of the security firm when approached by an intermediary. He also said he did not trust Yahoo to thoroughly investigate the breach since it could threaten the sale to Verizon.Find out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.\u201cThe limited InfoArmor data set provided to us by Bloomberg, based on initial analysis, could be associated with the data file provided to us by law enforcement,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThat said, if InfoArmor has a report or more information, Yahoo would want to assess that before further comment.\u201dThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was investigating the Yahoo breach. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York also said his office was in touch with Yahoo to examine the circumstances of the data breach.Verizon has said that it is weighing its options, which range from demanding a price cut to walking away altogether. Yahoo may still prove attractive, given the sheer size of its user base. But a huge defection of users would drastically lessen its value to Verizon.The question will be whether the telecom giant can be shielded from potential legal liability. Verizon already has an army of lawyers from heavyweight firms like Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advising it on the deal.If Verizon tried to walk away, the company could still find itself ensnared in a long legal battle. Efforts by companies to wiggle out of deals \u2014 usually by exercising escape hatches in transaction contracts \u2014 have often failed.Security experts and former government officials warned that the real danger of the Yahoo attack was not that hackers gained access to Yahoo users\u2019 email accounts, but that they obtained the credentials to hunt down more lucrative information about their targets wherever it resided across the web.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an attack against Yahoo, but rather reconnaissance to launch other campaigns,\u201d said Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency who now runs Area 1, a Silicon Valley security start-up.Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers.\u201cInactive or not, a billion user accounts and hashes means attackers have a golden key for new phishing attacks,\u201d he said. In a phishing attack, a hacker often poses as a trusted contact and tries to induce the recipient of an email to click on a malicious link or share sensitive information.Users routinely ignore advice to use different passwords for their different accounts across the web, which means a stolen Yahoo user name and password could open the door to more sensitive information in online-banking, corporate or government email accounts.Mr. Komarov said the group that hacked Yahoo in 2013, which he calls Group E, appeared to be motivated by money, not politics.It is believed to have broken into the systems of major American internet companies like LinkedIn, Myspace, Dropbox and Tumblr, as well as foreign-owned services like VKontakte, a Russian social network similar to Facebook.Group E sometimes sells complete copies of the data, Mr. Komarov said. It also combines information from different hacking forays into a master database. Like a corporate marketer, it peddles chunks of the data to spammers seeking to reach specific audiences, like middle-aged women who live in certain ZIP codes. It sometimes operates through intermediaries.Hold Security, another firm that monitors the so-called dark web, said that as recently as the end of October, hackers were actively trying to sell the stolen Yahoo data for as much as $200,000.That database of 1 billion Yahoo accounts, Mr. Komarov said, is still for sale, although current bids are coming in at $20,000 to $50,000 since the data is much less valuable now that Yahoo has changed the passwords.\u201cThere is now huge interest in Yahoo\u2019s database,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that there will be some new deals.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
