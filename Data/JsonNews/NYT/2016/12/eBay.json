{"Headline": "Alibaba Faces Growing Pressure Over Counterfeit Goods", "Date": "2016-12-22", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Alibaba has a fakes problem.It also comes as Alibaba moves to satisfy increasingly sophisticated Chinese consumers who want higher-quality goods \u2014 a shift that has also drawn intensifying competition from Alibaba\u2019s rivals.Alibaba says it has increased efforts to find and eliminate counterfeit goods. In its report on Wednesday, the Office of the United States Trade Representative acknowledged those efforts \u2014 but said they were not enough.Taobao \u201cis an important concern due to the large volume of allegedly counterfeit and pirated goods available and the challenges right holders experience in removing and preventing illicit sales and offers of such goods,\u201d the agency said, citing complaints from brand owners about the proliferation of fakes on Taobao.\u201cWhile recent steps set positive expectations for the future,\u201d it added, \u201ccurrent levels of reported counterfeiting and piracy are unacceptably high.\u201dIn an email to the group that oversees how Alibaba\u2019s platforms are governed, Daniel Zhang, the company\u2019s chief executive, pushed the group to continue fighting counterfeiters, whom he described as being \u201clike bacteria in the air that we breathe.\u201d But he also compared the American move to trade protectionism and said Alibaba would face similar efforts elsewhere as it expanded.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if we encounter other situations similar to that of \u2018Notorious Markets\u2019 in the future, where protectionism leads to malicious acts to players in the market,\u201d he wrote in the email, which the company shared publicly.In recent years Alibaba has de-emphasized Taobao, a vast platform resembling eBay where sellers big and small can set up online stores. Analysts say its growth prospects are limited, and a growing number of Chinese consumers say they want to buy from sources they can better trust.\u201cThe problem is that anybody can open a Taobao shop and sell anything,\u201d said Shaun Rein, the founder and managing director of China Market Research Group.Yu Yang, an information technology engineer in Beijing, said he had started using Taobao more than a decade ago. \u201cBut I almost stopped completely about three or four years ago,\u201d he said, adding that it had become difficult to tell fake from real basketball sneakers, which he collects.Alibaba said its core Chinese retail business had 439 million annual active users during the year that ended in September, though it did not break out how many of them were Taobao users. That business makes its money by charging fees to, and providing advertising for, vendors.Alibaba has tried to steer business to its Tmall platform, which is geared toward larger sellers of higher-end name brands like Nike and Est\u00e9e Lauder. But that business faces intense competition from JD.com and others that manage their own inventory and act more as curators for finicky customers.Tmall is the dominant player in the business-to-consumer segment, as Tmall and its rivals are called, with a little more than half of the market, according to figures from the data firm iResearch. But the data also shows that it has slowly lost market share to others.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Jewish Player\u2019s 1914 Baseball Card Triggers a $125,000 Dispute", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byMore than a hundred years after Guy Zinn last appeared in a major-league game, his baseball card is causing a commotion.Jeff Aeder, a Chicago real estate developer, is one of the most prominent figures in that subculture, and a 1914 Zinn card owned by a Maryland man has become, as other collectors describe it, Aeder\u2019s holy grail. It is believed to be the only card of its type still in existence.Aeder offered $125,000 for the card in 2014 and nearly claimed it. But the deal went sour at the last minute. Aeder balked because, he said, he received a poor appraisal of the card\u2019s condition. The owner, Dan McKee of Baltimore County, refused to renegotiate.\u201cI blocked his email,\u201d said McKee, who bought the card for $2,500 in 1995 at a show in Fort Washington, Pa. \u201cI don\u2019t do business like that. If you make a deal, you make a deal.\u201d\u201cIf Zinn was not a Jewish player, this card is probably worth $10,000,\u201d Aeder said. \u201cIf you talk to any dealer or collector, they\u2019ll say McKee\u2019s idea of value is the most overblown, crazy valuation of all time.\u201dSo why was Aeder willing, at one point, to pay $125,000? \u201cIt really is something that if you have the means and the obsession, then someone pays a lot more than it\u2019s worth,\u201d he said.Aeder and McKee, both 54, remain in a bitter standoff that highlights how passions that sprout in childhood can drive the sports memorabilia market.McKee, a software engineer who now works part time, became a collector when he was 7 and ultimately concentrated on unique cards and sets. McKee periodically posts some of his cards on auction websites \u2014 mostly out of curiosity, he said. He tends to list his items at exorbitant prices because, he said, he loathes parting with any card.\u201cI got stuff up in my eBay store that is actually part of my collection,\u201d McKee said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd every now and then, somebody hits the \u2018buy it now\u2019 button and I\u2019ll scream.\u201dHe did sell an 1894 Baltimore Orioles set \u2014 which was produced by the Alpha Photo Engraving Company \u2014 for six figures in 2006. McKee said the transaction had helped pay for his current home, but he declined to specify the sales price or the worth of his overall collection, which he called \u201ctoo valuable to admit to.\u201dMcKee displays much of his memorabilia in open cabinets and a World War II map case that he received from his Army National Guard unit. The more valuable items, however, are kept in safes.\u201cI keep a 9-millimeter in each one,\u201d he said, then added dryly, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather not use it if I don\u2019t have to.\u201dAeder also started collecting as a boy, while growing up in a family that, he has said, included Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax in its Yom Kippur prayers to honor his choice not to play in Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on the holiday.When Aeder was in his 30s, he said, he decided to sell his entire collection at a card show. That plan did not work out.\u201cInstead of selling, I wound up spending every penny on me buying new cards,\u201d he said.After completing the sets from his childhood, he turned to collecting the cards of Jewish baseball players.\u201cMany collectors are happy just to get one card of each player,\u201d said Martin Abramowitz of Newton, Mass., whose collection ended up with Aeder after Abramowitz sold it to someone else to help pay for his daughter\u2019s wedding. \u201cJeff is determined to get every card of every Jewish player.\u201dMcKee said he had no idea that Zinn was Jewish when he bought his card more than 20 years ago. McKee valued it for another reason. It was part of one of three sets that appeared as an insert in The Baltimore News and that provided a full season schedule on the back of each card.A 1914 version of these so-called schedule-backs included the first card ever made of Zinn, who was then in his fourth season and playing for the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League.Unlike the more popular cards of that era, which were produced by the American Tobacco Company, the schedule-backs were made from relatively thin material \u2014 like that of a playing card, but without the slick coating \u2014 and they were mostly discarded at the close of a season. As a result, few exist today. McKee said he had discovered 50 cards from the three schedule-back sets; some of them turned up as markers in old books.Aeder first spotted the Zinn card in 2014 on McKee\u2019s eBay store, where it was originally listed in 2010 as one of McKee\u2019s \u201cshow and tell\u201d items \u2014 for $250,000.\u201cHe wrote me and offered me $10,000,\u201d McKee said. \u201cHe rubbed me wrong, right off the bat.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to try to get a number,\u201d McKee said. But the company also rated the card, giving it a one out of 10.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful-looking card,\u201d McKee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s technical grade \u2014 because of the blue all the way to the edge, it has some chipping, it has a crease, it has some paper loss on the back \u2014 they\u2019re never going to give it more than a one or a 1.5.\u201dThe final grade disturbed Aeder. \u201cThe pictures he had sent did not look like it was a one,\u201d Aeder said.McKee said Aeder had suddenly begun overstating the importance of the card\u2019s condition. Aeder did ask about it in their first email exchange, McKee said, \u201cand I answered: \u2018The only one known. That\u2019s the only condition you need to know.\u2019\u201dAt an impasse, McKee and Aeder parted ways. They say they have not been in contact since.\u201cI\u2019m coming to terms with the fact that I may never own the Zinn card,\u201d Aeder said. \u201cWell, at least, I know I will never buy it from Dan McKee.\u201dBut both he and McKee hold out hope that another Zinn schedule-back card could still turn up somewhere.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Martin Abramowitz\u2019s sale of his baseball card collection. Abramowitz sold the collection to someone who then sold it to Jeff Aeder. Abramowitz did not sell directly to Aeder.An article on Monday about a dispute over a 1914 baseball card of Guy Zinn, a Jewish major leaguer, quoted incorrectly from comments by John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball. He said the interest surrounding the card illustrates \u201cthe acquisitiveness about the fan\u201d \u2014 not the inquisitiveness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Responsible When Extremists Get a Platform?", "Date": "2016-12-13", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIf these discussions were about litigating the past, their operating definition of what a platform is and does seemed to be stuck in the past as well. In computing, the word carries a different meaning. A platform is a system that enables other systems: A machine provides a platform for software; the software provides a platform for other software; that software might provide a platform for yet more software; and so on. The iPhone platform lets outside parties build and market apps like Uber; the Uber platform lets outside parties sign up to drive other Uber users for money.Somewhere between media and social media \u2014 between familiar ideas about politics and the news and the ones that underpin the world we live in today \u2014 platforms changed from responsibilities into abdications of responsibility. Claiming to provide a platform, in Silicon Valley, doesn\u2019t demand defense. It is the defense. Platforms don\u2019t cause problems; people do.The closest thing the new world of platforms has to a foundational text is a business book called \u201cInvisible Engines,\u201d published in 2006, which examined and tried to define a nascent form of business: one that doesn\u2019t just sell a good or service, but instead creates value by spawning entire ecosystems and economies. Nintendo and Sega, for example, allowed game developers to create and sell games that ran on their machines; smartphones let software companies connect with customers through app stores; eBay connects merchants and sellers, creating transactions but selling nothing itself. The book makes the prescient case that platforms will come to redefine our economy.\u201cThe platform\u2019s value is not necessarily what it does,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and one of the book\u2019s authors, \u201cbut what it enables.\u201d And what it enables can be enormous. It would be difficult to overstate the zeal that exists for platform companies in Silicon Valley. They represent staggering opportunities, the chance to create or remake entire industries and to preside over them indefinitely, with maximum control and minimum participation or liability. Airbnb has created a marketplace that overlaps substantially with the hotel business, but the properties it rents to users are owned by other users. (The company recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging a New York law that could result in fines against Airbnb for illegally listed properties; it agreed to drop the suit on the condition that fines be levied only against people listing property, not the company itself.) Uber created a sort of marketplace for transportation but doesn\u2019t own its vehicles nor \u2014 it claims, over and over, in courts all across the globe \u2014 does it employ its drivers.But the platform economies that are most developed and that have captured the most people \u2014 the ones that transact on attention, advertising and communication \u2014 are not immediately recognizable to their users as marketplaces. Facebook is not primarily understood among its billion and a half users as an attention brokerage, but that\u2019s exactly what it is: a middleman between users and other users; between advertisers and users; between developers and users; between publishers and advertisers and their viewers and readers.Participants successfully contribute to the broader marketplace by inducing other participants to engage more; beyond shares and followers, success is rewarded off-platform, with the conversion of attention into relationships, into advertising on websites, into sales or into influence and political power. Social platforms are the most extreme and advanced expression of what may be the defining corporate strategy of our time.And so it\u2019s valuable to listen to how they talk about themselves. In a comment under his post about the election, Zuckerberg reiterated, with force, what he sees as the nature of Facebook. \u201cI find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\u201d he wrote, explaining that the company also works on aerospace technology and business software. It\u2019s a platform that aspires to \u201cconnect the world\u201d but that must not be credited with changing it in the process.This line of thinking could not feel more distant from some of the alarming experiences social-media platforms foster. Reddit users terrorized by the openly bigoted and aggressive communities that have congregated there are not comforted by an appeal to economic principles. The virtues of an open platform are lost on the victim of a spontaneous Twitter mob, inspired anonymously or, as the case may be, by the president-elect of the United States. Understanding that the widespread belief in disinformation may have been an unforeseen externality of Facebook\u2019s design is more interesting than helpful, especially as Facebook says it will look to the wisdom of the crowd for solutions to its problems.In seeking and depending on minimum liability, platforms leave gaping voids. For an example of how such a void can be filled, and exploited, look no further than the Breitbart of the 2016 election. It is a site that frequently flaunts its success on social-media platforms and appears amenable to the prevailing winds of change. \u201cBreitbart Ranked #1 for Most Shared Facebook Content on Presidential Debate Day,\u201d read one headline. \u201cMedia Firms Lose Control of News as Tech Platforms Rise,\u201d read another from June. Another story from August begins, \u201cBreitbart News has jumped to the 11th biggest presence on Facebook in terms of total engagements for the month of July,\u201d a ranking of likes, shares and comments that placed the site between The Times and The Washington Post.The site is also keenly aware of its dependence on social media, so attempts made by these platforms to regulate participants or to ban or discourage hateful behavior are covered by Breitbart as conspiracies or assaults on freedom. The site wrote aggressively about frail allegations that Facebook had censored conservative content in its trending-topic module. (Facebook subsequently fired the team responsible for moderating it.) It describes attempts at Twitter moderation as censorship and has characterized the company\u2019s recent account bans as a \u201cpurge.\u201dMany media companies mistakenly imagine Facebook is some sort of partner \u2014 a larger entity that exists on the same spectrum. But Breitbart behaves as though it knows this isn\u2019t true. In practice, it has embraced its role as a platform citizen, one more subservient content peddler among many. In this sense, Breitbart couldn\u2019t have been the platform for the alt-right online. That title would belong to Reddit, to Twitter, to Facebook or to Google, if ever they wanted to claim it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holiday Style, on and Off the Ice, at the Rockefeller Center Rink", "Date": "2016-12-30", "News": "Supported bylife as a runwayThe first snow of the season had fallen, but that couldn't keep a mix of New Yorkers and visitors away from one of the city\u2019s most iconic holiday attractions: the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, which recently had its 80th anniversary. Visitors mostly dressed to ward off the cold, but this being New York, a few stylistic flourishes added some brio to the proceedings. We spoke to a few skaters and spectators about what they were wearing on a recent Saturday afternoon, a week before Christmas. This is what they told us.Samira KawashDo you come to the Rockefeller rink often?This is my first time: It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We\u2019re celebrating my birthday.You have your own skates, so that makes me think you skate often.I go skating a lot with my daughter. She inspires me. Usually we go to Chelsea Piers or the one in Prospect Park. Being here, I\u2019m enjoying the spectacle. It really does feel like you\u2019re in the middle of something exciting.I love your blue hair.It\u2019s inspired by moonlight and glaciers. I got to an age where it was time to do something fierce with my hair. My hair was going gray and I didn\u2019t want to color it to pretend that it wasn\u2019t going gray, so blue seemed the next place to go.A lot of people are wearing black, but you\u2019re wearing a nice gray coat.It\u2019s the silver/gray thing. Once my hair starting going white, I felt more comfortable in silvers and grays.Tell me about your sweater.Well, it\u2019s a woman skiing. I guess I\u2019m getting ready for ski season and feel inspired.Hilton CongerAre you from here?No, I\u2019m from Tennessee. We\u2019re visiting for the holidays, and it\u2019s my wife\u2019s birthday. She wanted to go ice skating at Rockefeller Center, so here we are.Not so much. It\u2019s the holidays, and my birthday is Christmas Day, so I have to wear red for Christmas.Your pants have little Santas all over them!They came from J. McLaughlin, in Nashville.Do you wear a lot of color?Yeah, pretty much. I wear a lot of patterns. I dress for the seasons. I wear a suit every day, linen ones in the summer.Do you feel like you have Southern style?I do wear a lot of bow ties. I\u2019ve been a slave to fashion all my life.How so?I worked at a men\u2019s store when I was in college. I had to dress up to work there. And as an attorney, I\u2019m in the courtroom, in front of people all the time.Where\u2019s your beret from?I\u2019ve had it for years, just for a season like this. I have a hat that my wife bought me for Christmas, down at JJ Hat Center, down on Fifth Avenue. It\u2019s a homburg. I wear them when the occasion calls for it.Justin Ennis Are you in New York for the holidays?No. I\u2019m here to see the Giants play tomorrow.When did you get the Giants hat?About three years ago.Is that when you started liking the Giants?No, I\u2019ve liked them for like five years. It used to be really big on me, but I grew into it.You\u2019re a really good skater.I\u2019m all right. I don\u2019t play hockey or anything. I just like to skate. I skate back home, not at outdoor rinks like this, but indoor rinks.I dig your pants.Camo is a big thing at my school, and I saw these and liked that they had the little zippers at the bottom. I just liked them a lot, and I had a little extra money to spend at the mall.And you have a classic toggle coat.My mom gave this to me; she just knew what I liked that day. And underneath I\u2019m wearing a sweater from H&M. I just got it a week ago. I just started wearing men\u2019s clothes, so I got a lot of options now.Neltilha GuadalupeWhere are you visiting from?Angola. I\u2019ll be here for four weeks. My sister lives here, so I\u2019ll be spending some time with her. It\u2019s my first holiday in the city and it\u2019s beautiful, amazing. It\u2019s a little cold for me.Tell me about your amazing coat.I bought it online when I was living in Houston. It\u2019s Trina Turk. I love that it\u2019s different. I like things that are different. Only fake fur, nothing real. I like to dress with a lot of colors. I like to pop, to really show up.Where are your boots from?They\u2019re Stuart Weitzman. I love them because I have big feet, and not everyone does boots for a woman with big feet.And look at that Chanel bag. Very fancy.My sister gave it to me for my birthday. She is a good sister. I got it about three years ago. I have another one, too, that\u2019s red. That\u2019s my go-to. I like the brand, and I know that if I want to sell it in a few years, it won\u2019t lose value.These glasses are sick.They\u2019re Christian Dior, the split glasses. I like this color because it\u2019s good on my skin tone.Are you wearing makeup?No, I don\u2019t like to wear makeup during the day, but if I had to go out I\u2019d put something on.Victor TyYou\u2019re obviously a regular on the ice.I started skating in \u201993 when I was 21. I skated for about 15 years straight every day. I\u2019m self-taught, and did some figure skating and played 14 seasons of hockey. Now, this is like my gym. This is my home rink.Is it still exciting to see the tree and stuff during the holidays?It\u2019s funny because there\u2019s a few regulars here, and we usually stay away during the holidays.You\u2019re not wearing a coat. What gives?It\u2019s not that cold. It\u2019s 40 degrees, and if you\u2019re moving around it\u2019s really not that cold. I\u2019ve played hockey before when it was minus-17 degrees, so I\u2019m used to it. I love the winter weather.Tell me about your jersey.This is the Chicago Blackhawks. I\u2019m a big hockey fan, and I have a whole series of jerseys I wear. I\u2019m a Rangers fan, but I come here with different jerseys. Underneath I have a shirt. I have three layers on. Usually you want to keep the torso and the head warm, but I don\u2019t have my hat on me.What are you listening to?I listen to opera. This is the only rink in the city where you can listen to your own music. It\u2019s easier to skate to your own music.Why opera?It\u2019s just a good tempo for the speed I like to go.Maria RinaldiWhere\u2019s your coat from?It\u2019s actually from Spain. I think it\u2019s raccoon. My friend gave it to me because she lost a lot of weight. That\u2019s how I got it. It\u2019s nice and warm, and I would never buy any fur, but this was a gift.You seem to like red. I like to match things.Where\u2019s your hat from?It\u2019s actually my sister\u2019s. I wear it because she died of cancer. She used to wear a lot of hats, and when she passed away, I took all of them.And what about your gloves?My son gave them to me. This is a funny interview.It\u2019s about style! How would you describe yours?I don\u2019t really have a style. I just wear what makes me feel comfortable, and that\u2019s it.Why are you in this neighborhood?I just love New York City. I always feel like a tourist. I was at home and said, let me take the bus and see Rockefeller Center. I just love it. It\u2019s pretty crowded. I live by Columbia University, and I\u2019ve lived in New York for a long time, since 1970. I love New York, I love New York.Do you always wear red lipstick?Oh yes, of course. I have to wear lipstick every time I leave the house.Mido NaoufelWhere are you from?Tell me about what you\u2019re wearing.My jacket is from H & M. My pants are Guess, but I cut them and ripped them up myself. And the shoes are Yeezy 950s. I got them from eBay.Are you a big Kanye fan?Now, not really. Well, I like his work.You\u2019re wearing ripped jeans on a cold day.As a Canadian, this isn\u2019t cold.Tell me about your beard.I cut it like three months ago. I had a much longer beard, like a two-year beard. I did it for the passport. Being an Arab, it\u2019s harder with the passport and traveling to the States.That\u2019s a big watch.Yeah, it\u2019s from Diesel. I like the rose gold.Where are your glasses from?Well they were sunglasses but I swapped in optical lenses because I liked the frames.Jessica HillWhere are you from?Wales. We\u2019re visiting for the holidays; we\u2019ve been here five days. It\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s our first time in New York. I love it. We\u2019ve done all the other big things, so we thought we\u2019d do this too, even though none of us can skate. We\u2019re in pain, but trying.What a lovely coat.It\u2019s my grandma\u2019s, actually. It\u2019s 20 years old.Is it real fur?Oh no. I\u2019m not a real fur kind of girl. I\u2019ve wanted it every since she had it. She bought a real fur coat, so she gave it to me because I didn\u2019t have anything to wear here and she knew it was going to be cold.Tell me about your hair.Long story. Naturally I\u2019m really, really blonde anyway, and I\u2019ve been every color you can imagine. In the past two years, I\u2019ve been the rainbow colors, but this is the first time in like two or three years that I\u2019ve had it a normal color. I bleached it, so I could go the brightest orange I could, and then that faded and I liked it.Why did you get a septum piercing?I got it for my birthday. I don\u2019t really know why. I just get all my piercings on a whim. I like the look of it. It\u2019s different.Michael McCurryAre you here visiting?Yep, I\u2019m from Nashville. Where\u2019s your jacket from?It\u2019s from Allen Edmonds. The scarf is from Saks and the jacket and shirt are customer made, from my tailor in Nashville. The name of the company is Pacific Fashions; he travels everywhere.How would you classify your style?Hmm, that I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s a mix. This is how I dress every day. I try to look as professional as I can. And I wear cowboy boots every day.That\u2019s an impressive beard.It\u2019s just something I came up with one day when I was camping. It kept growing, and I let it. And she loves it [gestures to girlfriend]. I told her it\u2019s probably something she wouldn\u2019t want to see.And you have a great hairstyle. Does it take a lot of work?No, it\u2019s really quick but I do get my hair cut every other week, and my beard.What\u2019s the story with those cuff links?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season", "Date": "2016-12-05", "News": "Supported byTwo years ago, the creative and design teams at the toy company Spin Master came up with a big idea they called \u201cHatchimals\u201d\u2014 an interactive, furry creature that hatches out of an egg and grows up before your eyes.Coaxing a creature out of its shell \u201cresonates very well with kids,\u201d said James Martin, senior vice president and head of global business at Spin Master, a Canadian toy company that also sells Etch A Sketch, among many other products. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside and they get excited about what they may get. There\u2019s this anticipation that builds.\u201dThe company, however, did not bargain on quite this much anticipation. Since their introduction in October, Hatchimals, which have a suggested retail price of $59.99, have become the hot toy of the holiday season that nobody can find. Desperate parents intent on buying a Hatchimal are waiting in long lines at retailers, putting their names on waiting lists, and even buying lottery tickets for the toy. Sellers on Amazon and eBay were asking more than three times the retail price on Friday.Though Spin Master is rushing distribution by airfreighting the remaining Hatchimals from factories in China, the company has not said how many more will be available throughout December, and the shortage is expected to continue. A new batch of Hatchimals will not be available until early in 2017.Spin Master worked to generate buzz for Hatchimals with a secretive launch, and managed to keep all images off the internet until the toy officially \u201chatched\u201d on Oct. 7, which it called \u201cGlobal Hatchimals Day.\u201d Company executives also planned for what they thought would be the right amount of product supply to meet the holiday demand. The company declined to release sales figures.\u201cBy all analyses, we thought we had enough,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cWe had no idea that it would be this big. It\u2019s been exciting but it\u2019s also been daunting as we try to catch up and fill that demand.\u201dThe toy is finding an audience in both boys and girls ranging in age from 3 to 12 years old \u2014 which is a larger demographic than the company expected.\u201cNobody knows why these things happen. They\u2019re an act of God,\u201d said Richard Gottlieb, chief executive of Global Toy Experts and publisher of Global Toy News. While the product may be clever, said Mr. Gottlieb, \u201cit\u2019s all about a moment in time, and it\u2019s hard to predict what makes a product connect.\u201dMandy Nigbur, a stockbroker in Riverton, Utah, knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to find a Hatchimal when her 7-year-old daughter requested one from Santa. So when Santa Claus made an appearance at her family party over Thanksgiving weekend, he \u201cknew to tell her his elves weren\u2019t making very many and they might be hard to come by,\u201d Ms. Nigbur said. \u201cBut I was on the hunt.\u201dMs. Nigbur and three of her friends took to the internet and found a website that alerts customers to what\u2019s in stock at retailers near them. They learned that their local Target was supposed to get a small shipment of Hatchimals on Friday, so the women arrived at Target at 4:45 a.m. and waited outside in the 20-degree cold. Their efforts paid off. They each purchased a Hatchimal, which Target sold for the suggested retail price \u2013 and quickly sold out of.\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if Mommy gets to be the star or if Santa will be the one who gets to bring it to her,\u201d said Ms. Nigbur, who said she may be more excited about nabbing the product than her daughter will be to receive it.The chase and the rush to find the item is actually part of the appeal when a certain toy \u2014 such as Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo \u2014 becomes a phenomenon, according to Mr. Gottlieb. \u201cThere is an irrational exuberance on the part of the consumer with these buying frenzies, which leads to a scarcity of product and crazy high prices,\u201d he said.Some parents have given up on finding a Hatchimal before the holidays. \u201cI am not proud to say I entered into a raffle to win a Hatchimal on a Facebook group,\u201d said Lindsey Hunter Lopez of Los Angeles, whose 3-year-old daughter asked for the toy. \u201cIt was a $10 buy-in for a spot, with 16 spots,\u201d she said. Ms. Lopez did not win the raffle, and said that she would not be hunting for the toy any further.Spin Master hopes to keep the excitement going well past the holidays, and promises that 2017 will bring new species of Hatchimals with more features. \u201cWe\u2019re telling consumers to just be patient,\u201d said Mr. Martin. \u201cThe magic is just as magical in January as it is in December. The experience is just as exciting then. In fact, it may be even a little more because you\u2019ll be getting the first batch of 2017.\u201dBut will kids still want Hatchimals next year, or will they have moved on?\u201cIt\u2019s a hit-driven industry and this is an expensive item, which really tend to sell only at holiday time,\u201d said Gerrick Johnson, an equity research analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s why the company is willing to airfreight, which is expensive, in order to capture those spending dollars now; rarely do you have an item like this that works two seasons in a row.\u201dSarah Gough, who lives near Guatemala City, is still halfheartedly searching for a Hatchimal for her 10-year-old daughter, but is not expecting to find one soon. \u201cI looked at our major retailer twice and they don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d Ms. Gough said. She plans to ask her parents to look for the toy in the United States. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t really into standing in any lines to pick up toys,\u201d she said.To those parents who are not able to buy the toy in time, Dr. Deborah Gilboa, a family physician in Pittsburgh and a parenting and youth development expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great lesson in delayed gratification.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Fund Seeks Both Financial and Social Returns", "Date": "2016-12-19", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cThere is a lazy mindedness that we afford the do-gooders.\u201dThat was Bono, the musician turned activist turned investor, lamenting the pitfalls of what has become an increasingly fashionable form of financing: social impact investing.Just about every big Wall Street firm and big-time philanthropist has recently tried to get in on what\u2019s often called double bottom line investing. The idea is that an investment isn\u2019t just intended to score a high return; perhaps more important, it is supposed to make a significant difference in an area that had been considered un-investable. Goldman Sachs, for example, created social impact bonds to reduce the recidivism rate for adolescent offenders at the Rikers Island correctional facility in New York City.Most of these efforts have had mixed results; either investors lost money, or the social impact was negligible or nonexistent.It has become, as Bono told me, \u201ca lot of bad deals done by good people.\u201dMr. McGlashan has long overseen TPG Growth, a fund he started that was an early investor in the sharing economy, with stakes in Uber and Airbnb, as well other technology successes like Spotify. His first fund had an annualized rate of return \u2014 the metric that private equity firms use to measure themselves \u2014 of 20 percent; the second fund\u2019s return was 45 percent.Others have tried to build social impact funds at a much smaller scale. Rise does away with benchmarks manufactured after the fact and has created a series of strict metrics by which to measure social impact. And an outside auditor has been brought in to keep it honest.And the investors involved don\u2019t consider this charity \u2014 pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are expected to be among the biggest investors. At least two large pension funds and one sovereign wealth fund have committed nine figure sums, according to people briefed on the investments, which have yet to be made public.\u201cThe reality is that no matter which side of the aisle you\u2019re on, and no matter where your framework is, if I can build a great business that\u2019s profitable and successful and, oh, by the way, here\u2019s the impact and the multiple of impact that\u2019s created through that business\u2019s successes, I think that\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d Mr. McGlashan told me.The new fund is expected to invest about half of its money domestically in areas like health care, education and clean energy technologies. The other half will be invested in emerging markets in sectors like microlending and other financial services, housing and education.\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of charity here,\u201d Mr. McGlashan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make money and build profitable successful businesses and create a top performing fund. But in the process, what we\u2019ve committed to is that we will not do a deal where there\u2019s less than a two and a half times multiple of impact,\u201d suggesting a meaningful social impact that can be measured.The problem with most of these kinds of funds is what Mr. McGlashan calls \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d a euphemism for lying, which some in philanthropy feel is rampant among socially conscious investors. Everyone wants to claim some form of success using a shifting mix of metrics aimed at demonstrating how the fund worked.\u201cNone of this makes sense unless you can actually define what \u2018impact\u2019 means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be religion; it has to be quantitative. It has to be something that a third-party view would validate.\u201dBono put it this way: \u201cI asked them to hang a sign in their office saying, \u2018Warm Fuzzy Feelings Not Welcome Here,\u2019 because we need them to be tough-minded. We need some intellectual rigor, and you\u2019ve got to get these metrics right.\u201dMr. McGlashan, often in concert with Mr. Skoll, spent the past year working with Bridgespan Group, a consulting firm that has long worked for philanthropists \u2014 including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 to come up with a rigorous set of metrics with which to measure performance.If it works, Mr. McGlashan hopes to one day change the fee structure of funds like this so the investors are paid based on social impact, not necessarily just on financial performance. For the first Rise fund, Mr. McGlashan\u2019s group, which will include most of TPG Growth\u2019s professional staff, will be paid on financial performance, which is likely to make his job harder, not easier. He needs to find good investments, but his board and investors will also be focusing on whether the fund also delivers on its social impact promise.Mr. Skoll said he expected to know whether the fund would be successful in relatively short order. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a good idea within two years,\u201d he said.Bridgespan\u2019s metrics for Rise could become a model for other investment firms if they prove successful, especially in a global political climate that is rethinking its capitalistic system.\u201cCapitalism is going up on trial, and I think that it\u2019s clear that putting profit before people is a nonsustainable business model,\u201d Bono said. \u201cI think giving those two equal time is the way forward, and I think that in the present climate, we need to rethink, reimagine what it is. It\u2019s not that capitalism is immoral; it\u2019s amoral. And it\u2019s a better servant than master.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe have to be a bit modest about where we are with Rise and be actually a bit tough on ourselves. I\u2019d be more comfortable speaking about this in a year\u2019s time or two year\u2019s time as we go along.\u201dLet\u2019s plan on that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Gives Samsung a Reprieve in Apple Patent Case", "Date": "2016-12-06", "News": "Supported byA federal law says that companies found liable for infringing design patents on an \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, turned on the meaning of the quoted phrase.Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers \u2014 here, Samsung\u2019s phones \u2014 and sometimes be the components found to have infringed a design patent.\u201cAll told,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote, \u201cApple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung\u2019s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.\u201dDesign patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in over a century.\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the appellate court said.Justice Sotomayor\u2019s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the whole phone or just parts of it. She said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that \u201cthe relevant \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 must always be the end product sold to the consumer.\u201d\u201cIn the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote. \u201cIn the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.\u201dThe Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration, drawing out the final resolution of a case that has transfixed Silicon Valley since it was filed in 2011.Technology companies often imitate innovations made by their rivals and incorporate hundreds or thousands of patented ideas in a new product. The largest companies often cross-license their patents to one another to minimize infringement claims.The Supreme Court battle between Apple and Samsung centered on what happens when the infringement involves just a few features of a product\u2019s design.Apple \u2014 backed by dozens of independent designers as well as fashion-focused companies like Nike and Tiffany \u2014 argued that design is central to many products and that a patent violator should be forced to turn over the full profits it made from infringing designs.Samsung \u2014 whose position was backed by Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, eBay and HP \u2014 argued that any penalties should be proportionate to the importance of the infringing features to the overall product.The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, while not decisively resolving the case, found that liability in design patent cases is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition. But the justices declined to offer more specific guidance. So now Apple and Samsung, the two leaders in the smartphone market, will go back to court to wrangle over the appropriate amount of damages for Samsung\u2019s infringement.In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said, \u201cOur case has always been about Samsung\u2019s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\u2019t right.\u201dA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister Cohen, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\u201dJustice Sotomayor\u2019s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. \u201cAn \u2018article\u2019 is just \u2018a particular thing,\u2019\u201d she wrote, citing two dictionaries. \u201cAnd \u2018manufacture\u2019 means \u2018the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man\u2019 and \u2018the articles so made.\u2019\u201cAn article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,\u201d she concluded. \u201cSo understood, the term \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.\u201dPatent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age.\u201cThe court basically punted,\u201d said Mark A. Lemley, a law professor and director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology, who had previously filed a brief on behalf of Samsung in the case. \u201cIt seems to have clearly in its mind that the patent could cover only a portion of the device. But it said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to tell you what the right rule is.\u2019\u201dMr. Lemley said the ruling was one of several recent patent decisions by the court that struck down patent guidelines used by the Federal Circuit without replacing them with clear alternatives. In particular, he cited cases involving the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees in patent cases and guidelines for deciding whether a patent has been willfully violated.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Change Purse in T-Rex Skin, Perhaps?", "Date": "2016-12-07", "News": "Supported byCritical ShopperStuart Vevers, the Coach creative director, has dug up more than a few great ideas since taking over the brand in 2013, but his best has been dinosaur bones.Coach closed 20 percent of its stores in 2014 to refocus, and then, in 2015, Mr. Vevers introduced ready-to-wear. He also gave the 75-year-old American leather goods company a new mascot: a T-Rex skeleton (though she also appears in the flesh on Coach sweaters) named Rexy.Rexy has a cohort of sidekicks called the Coach Beasts, anthropomorphized leather bones strung on key chains: Steggy, a stegosaurus; Tricky, a triceratops; and Woolly, a woolly mammoth. When prodded for Rexy\u2019s origin story, Mr. Vevers celebrated that there is none. He told Fashionista.com, \u201cIt has nothing to do with our heritage.\u201d He told Vogue.com, \u201cI really like it because it\u2019s so random, and it has no connection to Coach or any of my typical references.\u201dBut shopping at Coach House, the company\u2019s new flagship on Fifth Avenue and the biggest Coach store in the world, I found a deep connection. Let\u2019s dig!The store\u2019s foyer has a ceiling conveyor belt mechanical decoration, a sort of Industrial Revolution Calder that makes dresses and bags drift across the ceiling. Soothing. Just inside, I meet a towering 12-foot sculpture of Rexy made from vintage Coach bags. Not as soothing.Standing at the store\u2019s first glass case, I ask a saleswoman if I can look at a leather sketchbook embossed with Never Say Die ($195). As I say it, I realize the glass case is open in front; I can reach for it myself. How many glass boundaries are in my head? The next I pick up says We Let Them Go.Upstairs, I\u2019m drawn to a silk Western shirt embroidered with fat buttercups ($495). The front of the shirt curves up to the buttons like two flower petals. I try it under the Western Blouson, a minibomber with yellow piping and the same lemony flowers ($895). The unlined wool fits as if it\u2019s made of leather, it holds my shoulders and barely cups my lower back. I can\u2019t buy a $500 shirt; so I search on eBay: Western rodeo shirt Brokeback Mountain Anne Hathaway embroidery flower true happiness.\u201cDo you wear dresses?\u201d the salesman asks. He has brought me a fringed leather jacket ($1,900) and a printed bib dress with doily lace, like an antimacassar on the back of a homestead chair ($695). For a British designer, Mr. Vevers has some wit to offer touchstones of Americana. Wacky hot-rod embellishments, living-room-set prints and studded leather fringe remind me of various past Prada collections. But in a good way.Coach\u2019s target audience seems much younger than that of the era of demure bags (now bags have embellishment, or at least are styled with a key chain) and C-logo loafers (studded platform boots are now the staple). The accents and humor are incorporated not so much with a playful wink as an enjoyable eye roll. Since 2015, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, 19, has been the face of Coach campaigns, and one of the most shared images from the spring 2017 show was Millie Bobby Brown, 12, wearing a shiny pink jacket, arms around Winona Ryder. And in the store you can slap various emoji on leather accessory tags, which is most likely to charm those for whom phones never actually leave hands to go into a purse.Dress off, I slide into a pair of black leather pants like a snake that changed its mind about shedding. I try them with the Wild Beast Sweatshirt with caviar-size black beads, embroidery and leather meant to evoke a paint-by-numbers landscape ($395). The salesman brings me a reversible gray coat. Inside is shearling with big nubs of fleece like oatmeal extra swollen from the microwave, and outside is truly perfect matte leather ($2,400). I look at him like, \u201cWhy did you put me in this position?\u201d He replies, \u201cYou\u2019ll have it forever.\u201dAs I change back into my clothes, I hear him say it to the woman trying something on across the hall: \u201cYou\u2019ll have it forever!\u201dThis is when Rexy really strikes me as a brilliant mascot. Dinosaurs are the icons for the impermanence of the mighty, a reminder that even the most fearsome things can someday be key chains.There is a difference between \u201ctimeless\u201d and seemingly lasting forever. The best thing about a Coach bag is how it wears. (An archival display in the store showcases discontinued-for-now styles, like the 1974 slim satchel and the 1990s Legacy Small Flap.) Even the most finely crafted things wear down. A few of the label\u2019s vintage Dinky bags are for sale ($695), repurposed with colorful leather flowers and displayed next to a workstation where an aproned craftsman (a 30-year Coach veteran) will consult on and make repairs for a fee \u2014 and, a saleswoman said, clean old Coach bags at no charge.A few days after the Coach House opened, construction workers expanding the Los Angeles Metro stumbled upon elephant fossils (perhaps a mammoth, like Coach\u2019s Woolly), tusks and a skull underneath Wilshire Boulevard. Rexy is the mascot of re-emergence, no explanation required.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shadow of Amazon, European Challenger Looks to China for Inspiration", "Date": "2016-12-16", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it.\u201cWe wanted to take that experience back to Europe,\u201d Mr. Gentz said.This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe\u2019s biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world\u2019s dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent\u2019s still-fragmented world of digital fashion.In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess.The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando.These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley heavy-hitters a run for their money across the region, still one of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 markets.\u201cIf you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional e-commerce player,\u201d said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary move.\u201dZalando\u2019s inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges.Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox Net-a-Porter, may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on e-commerce.For most Americans \u2014 and even some Europeans outside its core German-speaking markets \u2014 Zalando is not a household name.To meet the needs of Europe\u2019s national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders.\u201cZalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,\u201d said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London.Still, the company remains a relative minnow \u2014 its $9.5 billion valuation is one-fortieth that of Amazon. And Europe\u2019s fast-growing online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by e-commerce giants.To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape.On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on push-scooters sped through Zalando\u2019s first custom-built logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more \u2014 from Italy to Germany \u2014 are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London.As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando\u2019s I.P.O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion.For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando\u2019s website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility.\u201cNo one else offers this level of partnership,\u201d said Roland Auschel, Adidas\u2019s head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.The e-commerce company has also offered up its in-house advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with \u201conline influencers,\u201d or personalities with large social media followings.For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger.\u201cIn the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,\u201d Mr. Borg said.\u201cThat is our biggest challenge,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do we change the online experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kylie Jenner and the Year of the Drop", "Date": "2016-12-14", "News": "Supported byThe Year in Style 2016Last Friday, on a sunny December morning, chaos descended upon a glossy shopping mall in the Canoga Park section of Los Angeles.Thousands of young women (and a few men), many of whom had slept in the parking lot of the Westfield Topanga mall overnight or traveled from several states away, surged en masse at 10 a.m. toward a monochrome, recently erected temporary store on the first floor. Hours later, most shoppers were still there, waiting in snaking lines and shrieking intermittently. Others, their eyes downcast, tapped on smartphones.\u201cThe empire, it\u2019s all for you,\u201d Ms. Jenner said as she arrived to open her store, part of which she designed herself by taking inspiration from the bedroom of her mansion in Calabasas, Calif. (imagine a gigantic bed with white sheets, a pink neon autograph on black walls and video installation of Ms. Jenner in lingerie and a fur coat rolling around in bed with her rapper boyfriend, Tyga). She waved and blew kisses \u2014 the scene was streamed on Snapchat \u2014 before taking a few selfies with fans. Pandemonium ensued.[See more Year in Style articles]\u201cIn the e-commerce age, older consumers have shown that they want ease, convenience and plenty of variety from their shopping experience,\u201d said Avery Booker, the chief executive of Enflux, a digital influence-mining tool. But, he said, when it comes to Generation Z, those born in the years from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, and the younger millennials, \u201cin many cases the opposite is emerging.\u201d\u201cThey are excited not just by a product\u2019s rarity,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut also by what credibility owning that product can give them within their social media communities, as well as its possible resale value.\u201dThe flourishing secondary markets, fueled by online resellers and prompted by the growing clout of drop culture, has been one of the most significant changes to the retail landscape in recent years. Mere hours after the latest Kylie Lip Kit, Supreme sneaker or H&M/Alexander Wang piece has sold out on official distribution channels, these items are often available elsewhere on the internet, though with one or more zeros added to the price. For savvier fans, the use of auto-fillers or bots to skip the digital lines for valuable items is increasing.Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of the innovation group at advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, said Generation Z was far more entrepreneurial than its predecessors.\u201cIf millennials are digitally savvy, then Generation Z are total digital natives,\u201d Ms. Greene said. \u201cThey are completely au fait with the internet and social media platforms, and comfortable using them to create anything from fan forums to charities and their own minibusinesses. Their identities are defined by their interactions and relationships online, both with one another and celebrities.\u201cThat\u2019s why stars like Kylie Jenner, who interact with them like peers on the mediums they feel most comfortable with rather than more traditional retail platforms, are seeing such astronomical success.\u201dSome independent businesses are also recognizing new opportunities to profit and are building new services accordingly. Depop, which was started in Britain in 2012, is a buying, selling and swapping app for clothes, accessories and other wares. It created communities of influencers and like-minded shoppers and has strong roots in the resale market. Eighty percent of its user base is under 30.\u201cBrands like Supreme and Palace really understand successful 21st-century branding and how to appeal to younger consumers from the selfie generation,\u201d said Maria Raga, the chief executive of Depop. \u201cThere is no question that our business is capitalizing on their success. Many of the most successful resellers to emerge out of the drop culture don\u2019t just see what they do as a way of making money. They see it as a way of building their own brand. They can gain huge profiles and followings in their own right.\u201dIt\u2019s not necessarily in their nature to save the earnings from transactions either. \u201cTo keep up their social media credentials, Generation Z feel they need to change their clothing much quicker than shoppers in their late 20s upward,\u201d Ms. Raga said. \u201cPlus there is always a hot new pricey brand on the up. Most of them are students. They aren\u2019t really earning money yet. So to buy more, they need to keep selling stuff.\u201dCharles Fitchew, a 13-year-old in Manchester, England, is one example. He said he did 95 percent of his shopping online, with the traditional majority of any new purchases coming from drops. Lately, however, he said a growing number now came from transactions that took place on Facebook messenger chat groups, particularly for sneaker resales, which tend to be dominated by young men. (No surprise: Kylie Jenner\u2019s sales are predominantly driven by teenage girls and women in their 20s.)\u201cThese days, if you want the coolest stuff you have three options,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can queue up overnight outside a store before a drop or hope for the best online. You can go to an established site if you miss out or can\u2019t be bothered to wait, like eBay or Depop, but expect to pay double the original price. Or you can go on Snapchat or a Facebook Talk group, get a better bargain and really be able to ask questions about the quality and condition of what\u2019s being sold.\u201d\u201cIf it isn\u2019t up to scratch, then the seller gets kicked out by the rest of the community,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s how things work at our age. The best things should never be easy to get, otherwise what\u2019s their value? To be honest, I can\u2019t really imagine things being any other way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What you see here is just a fraction of what I have. Oh, honey, there\u2019s a whole warehouse of it down in the basement.What drew you to cartoon characters? I know that you seem to be constantly beating down metaphorical readings that your subject matter is a dark commentary on consumer culture or childhood or America itself.I got into Mickey Mouse early on, really, because of his shape. The ears, the eyes, the circles, how simple he was but also how great those shapes looked in a painting. And I think I\u2019ve made him a Mickey who is not just a happy Mickey; he\u2019s got a lot more substance than that, more character. [Ms. Pensato shifted her attention to a Mr. Potato Head plastic toy on a nearby shelf.] Look at the eyeballs on this guy!Why do you love a messy studio?I think it\u2019s just who I am.

{"Headline": "A World of Surveillance Doesn\u2019t Always Help to Catch a Thief", "Date": "2016-12-18", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, I had a beer in one of the more budget-conscious bars in the Mission district. My wallet stayed a little later than I did.I didn\u2019t notice that until 11 a.m. the next day, when I got a call from my bank. Hey, a helpful man in card fraud detection asked, in the last 12 hours had I been to McDonald\u2019s twice, taken four rides with Uber, purchased a disposable phone at MetroPCS, and visited Walgreens and Target?What followed was sadly familiar to many of us: I spent the day canceling credit cards, ordering new health insurance identification, replacing my driver\u2019s license, and trying to remember what else, besides cash, was in my wallet.A week later, relatively whole again in plastic, I received from my bank a list of all of the charges (which the bank covered). They provided a rough guide to the evening.Looking at the numbers, I began to wonder: How many times, during that disappointingly banal crime spree, was my thief photographed, tagged, measured or otherwise observed in our semi-constant world of databases? And with a modest effort, how hard would it then be for the police to find him?The answer to the first question is, probably several dozen times. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all this monitoring is helpful to someone like me.Some companies are reluctant to talk about how much they are filming you, or how long they keep the images. Others simply have a hard time knowing.For example, about 90 percent of the 13,000 or so McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the United States are owned by independent owner-operators, so the company can\u2019t really say if those people have cameras. \u201cWe assume the majority do,\u201d said Terri Hickey, a company spokeswoman. \u201cWe strongly recommend their installation and use.\u201dWhat about a McDonald\u2019s in San Francisco? \u201cAlmost certainly there\u2019s cameras, inside and out,\u201d said Grace Gatpandan, an officer with the city\u2019s Police Department. \u201cIf it\u2019s a drive-through, they\u2019re going to have a camera.\u201d Some of those cameras are to record people who try to drive off without paying, or to catch employee theft.A Walgreens at 23rd and Mission Streets, another stop that night, is well equipped with cameras, too. \u201cAt least two in the pharmacy, the entranceway, probably over the shopping aisles,\u201d said Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman. \u201cWe like those, and some of the ones on the exterior, to be visible, and we put a sign in the front so people know they\u2019re being filmed.\u201dLike many other big stores, Walgreens often has other, smaller cameras about door height, to catch faces in case the police want close-ups of people.Target was not willing to talk about what my thief bought with my card, or its use of video, but it may be the most extensive watcher of all. Just the checkout area of its store at Fourth and Mission Streets in San Francisco, the most likely location my thief visited, has at least 18 cameras, from four manufacturers.The thief spent almost $200 at Target, enough to afford nine of the 13 different home video surveillance cameras Target sells there. That would have involved walking past another 50 highly visible surveillance domes.The San Francisco Police Department likes this video deluge, according to a department spokesman, Carlos Manfredi, because things like credit card fraud are often linked to other crimes. \u201cWe\u2019ll circulate pictures of people to all the stations around town, to see if other officers know the person from other crimes,\u201d he said.They also go up on private channels on YouTube and Vimeo, he said.My case was at the other end of the crime spectrum, but even the style of the crime provides clues about the thief. This man or woman started small, with the McDonald\u2019s and Walgreens purchases, and apparently made the big purchase at Target once there was confidence the card was going through. The thief also stuck to one card.Is it weird to feel a little shame here? What, my card isn\u2019t good enough for the high-end service?Mr. Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor in Las Vegas who has also worked at eBay and Facebook, said criminals called these small purchases \u201cbust-out charges.\u201d \u201cYou go little at first, make sure the card works,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen you go big.\u201d My bank appears to have stepped in right after the first substantial purchase.That isn\u2019t to say that my thief was a master criminal. I don\u2019t have an Uber account, and he (Mr. Sullivan\u2019s term, though Uber\u2019s privacy rules prevented the company from telling me anything more) put the card on an existing account.Uber also has GPS data on every ride, time stamps on rides, and the names of drivers. The drivers are allowed cameras of their own in cars, but Uber doesn\u2019t know how many use them.\u201cIf the police are interested in your case, we have a lot we can share with them,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.Big \u201cif.\u201d After two visits and three calls to the Mission district station, and three calls and two emails with San Francisco Police Department public affairs (a route not open to most civilians), the police assigned someone to my case. That was well over a month after the theft. Walgreens gave them some video, which has been circulated, but Target had already junked its footage.Uber, which over its four rides obtained route information and the person\u2019s address, was not contacted.Advertisement"}
