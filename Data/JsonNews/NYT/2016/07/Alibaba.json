{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Leaves Shareholders With Little Say", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorYahoo\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon is a complicated beast, showing how different acquisition structures can affect how shareholders are treated.First, let\u2019s say what the Yahoo sale is not. It is not a sale of the publicly traded company. Instead, it is a sale of the Yahoo subsidiary and some related assets to Verizon.Because it is a sale of a subsidiary, the $4.8 billion will be paid to Yahoo. Its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend (after paying taxes). Instead, Yahoo shareholders will be left holding shares in the renamed company.As for Remain Co., it will become a so-called investment company. This is a special designation for a company that holds securities for investment but does not operate a working business. Investment companies are subject to special regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Remain Co. will probably just sit there, returning cash to shareholders and waiting for Alibaba to buy it in a tax-free transaction. (Alibaba says it has no plans to do this, but most people do not believe this).The rights of Yahoo shareholders in this sale will be different from those in an ordinary sale, when an entire company is bought.In either case, shareholders get a say. They either vote on the merger or decide whether to tender into the offer.The Yahoo deal, however, is not a sale of the public company. It is an asset sale, in which there is only a shareholder vote if there is a sale of \u201call\u201d or \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the assets of the company. Yahoo is not all of the assets or even \u201csubstantially all\u201d \u2013 the Alibaba shares being left behind in Remain Co. are worth about $28 billion, or six times the value of the cash Verizon is paying for the Yahoo assets it is buying.There will be no appraisal rights, however. Again, in an asset sale, there are no appraisal rights. So anyone who votes against the deal and thinks this is a bum price is out of luck.The different standards for voting and appraisal rights apply because the structure of the deal is a quirk of the law in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, that allows lawyers to sometimes work around these issues simply by changing the way a deal is done.In Yahoo\u2019s case, this is not deliberate, though. It is simply the most expedient way to get rid of the assets.Finally, if another bidder still wants to acquire Yahoo, it has time. The agreement with Verizon allows Yahoo to terminate the deal and accept a superior offer by paying a $144 million breakup fee to Verizon. And if Yahoo shareholders change their minds and want to stick with Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, and vote down the deal, there is a so-called naked no-vote termination fee of $15 million payable to Verizon to reimburse expenses.All in all, this was as hairy a deal as they come. There was the procedural and logistical complications of selling a company when the chief executive wanted to stay. Then there was the fact that this was an asset sale, including all of the challenges that go with it. Throw in all of the tax issues and the fact that this is a public company, and it is likely that the lawyers involved will have nightmares for years to come.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank Group Nears Deal to Buy ARM Holdings", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byThe deal would be the first large-scale, cross-border transaction in Britain since it voted to exit the European Union last month. ARM had been seen as a safe haven from the volatility surrounding \u201cBrexit\u201d because its chip technology is used in mobile phones all over the world, with limited revenue derived from Britain.ARM, which designs chips and parts of chips, had a market capitalization of about $22 billion as of Friday\u2019s close. ARM would be one of SoftBank\u2019s largest acquisitions ever.ARM had been a leader in chips for mobile devices in the early years, while other semiconductor companies were focused on desktops. The switch to mobile has been difficult for ARM\u2019s competitors, particularly Intel, placing ARM in a prime position to dominate the market for chips used in cellphones and tablets.SoftBank, based in Tokyo, invests in technology, media and telecommunications companies, and ARM could provide an additional boost to SoftBank\u2019s mobile strategy. SoftBank owns about 83 percent of the American wireless operator Sprint, meaning that with the acquisition of ARM, SoftBank would own the carrier and the chip designer.Requests made to ARM for comment were not immediately returned. A representative from SoftBank declined to comment.SoftBank has made some big moves at the top as well. The company said last month that Nikesh Arora, who joined SoftBank two years ago from Google, would be leaving. He had been seen as the heir apparent to Masayoshi Son, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, and someone who could catapult SoftBank and its global ambitions through deal making. But once he stepped down, Mr. Son signaled that he was not yet ready to give up control.ARM has become somewhat of a secret success. The company, based in Cambridge, England, makes chips for a large majority of the world\u2019s cellphones. ARM generates more than $1 billion in annual revenue by licensing its designs to large chip-makers.ARM traces more than half of its revenue to Asia, while about 38 percent comes from North America. Only 1 percent of its revenue is from Britain, according to its latest annual report.ARM was founded in 1990 and has grown into a company with 4,000 employees, a majority of them engineers. In 2015, ARM\u2019s customers said they shipped about 15 billion chips, with just under half of those going into mobile devices, the company said in its annual release.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Yahoo, Question Is What to Do With $40 Billion in Leftovers", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported bySo what\u2019s left? A lot of more financially valuable pieces that Yahoo has yet to figure out what to do with.Assuming shareholders and regulators bless the sale of the core Yahoo businesses to Verizon, what will stay are a 15 percent stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese internet giant; a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo\u2019s Japanese affiliate; the company\u2019s cash; and a collection of noncore patents that will eventually be sold off.The total value of the so-called RemainCo, as company officials refer to the rump: more than $40 billion.But the sticking point for Yahoo, as was the case in the past, is the fact that selling the Alibaba stake in particular will generate a huge tax bill. That\u2019s why Yahoo had previously explored permutations of a spinout of its core business, leaving the Alibaba stake in a separate publicly traded company of some kind.Monday\u2019s deal effectively does that, although it also leaves behind the Yahoo Japan stake and a few other assets. Where does that leave the company?Thomas McInerney, the Yahoo board member who led the company\u2019s sales process, said on a call with investors that RemainCo would essentially exist as a publicly traded investment company \u201cwith no current intent.\u201dOf the remaining assets, the Alibaba stake is the trickiest one to manage. Yahoo would incur an enormous tax bill if it sold the stake outright \u2014 to the tune of billions of dollars \u2014 since its initial investment in the Chinese e-commerce titan has skyrocketed in value.Yahoo\u2019s previous attempts at dealing with the Alibaba stake were aimed at minimizing the tax bill. But the Internal Revenue Service dealt a blow to the company\u2019s plans last year when it refused to deem such a move tax-free.It\u2019s possible for a buyer to come in and purchase the Alibaba stake without incurring a huge tax bill, though Yahoo executives on Monday didn\u2019t enumerate all the possibilities.Mr. McInerney did raise one potential situation, however: Alibaba itself buying RemainCo, but essentially keeping it whole and not reabsorbing the shares. RemainCo would become what the director referred to as a \u201chook stock.\u201d It\u2019s not quite clear that either side would be interested in pursuing such a transaction.Other parts of RemainCo are much easier to deal with. The Yahoo Japan stake isn\u2019t subject to as nearly a contentious tax bill as the Alibaba holdings, though for the moment the rump company will hold on to that stake. (The majority owner of Yahoo Japan, SoftBank, has the right of first refusal if RemainCo decides to sell those shares.)And Mr. McInerney said that the rump company would return virtually all of the remaining cash and continue to work on selling the patents.In case investors and analysts did not grasp the message, he added during the call: \u201cWe\u2019re not intending to make new investments with the cash out of RemainCo. The intent is to return it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were far more interested in whether Yahoo\u2019s web, email, news and other businesses will finally be sold \u2014 and at what price.Ms. Mayer had little to say about the potential sale in a webcast with investors to discuss the results. She noted that the company had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d on the strategic review process but offered no timeline for a decision.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s flailing business will make it difficult to get top dollar for the company. According to the research firm eMarketer, Yahoo will get about 1.5 percent of the world\u2019s digital ad revenue this year, down from 2.1 percent last year. By comparison, Google is expected to command 30.9 percent of the market and Facebook is expected to garner 12 percent.Analysts expect the final bids to come in at $3.5 billion to $6 billion, including Yahoo\u2019s land and patents.The write-off of most of the value of the Tumblr blogging network is emblematic of the failure of Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategy to expand Yahoo by luring the mobile young users who drive the business of its chief rivals, Google and Facebook.Yahoo said it was writing off an additional $482 million of Tumblr\u2019s purchase price on top of the $230 million write-off it took in the first quarter.In the second quarter, Yahoo\u2019s revenue was $1.31 billion, up from $1.24 billion in the same quarter a year ago. But the most recent quarter\u2019s revenue rose only because of a change in how Yahoo accounts for revenue from its search partnership with Microsoft. Excluding those changes, revenue fell 15 percent, and both search ads and display ads posted significant drops.The company reported a net loss of $440 million, or 46 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss $22 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the Tumblr write-off and other adjustments, the company\u2019s operating profit fell 64 percent.Shares of Yahoo were down slightly in after-hours trading Monday evening.Ms. Mayer noted that one bright spot for the industry, video advertising, was beginning to see price drops in the face of a glut of inventory as Facebook, Twitter and others churn out more live video and clips. \u201cThere\u2019s so much video, particularly mobile video, coming online that there is some price compression,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

It devises chips and parts of chips that use less power so that they can be used in smaller gadgets. ARM had a market capitalization of about $22 billion as of Friday\u2019s close, and the proposed acquisition represents a 43 percent premium over the company\u2019s closing share price last week.Started in 1990 as a spinoff from Acorn Computers, a now-defunct British computer maker, ARM has gone from a small start-up of fewer than 20 people to a global leader whose technology is used in more than 90 percent of smartphones produced by Apple and Samsung, among others.ARM took an early lead on chips for mobile devices, while the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets has been more challenging to traditional chip makers like Intel.Unlike Intel, ARM forgoes the high margins \u2014 and equally high production costs \u2014 of directly manufacturing microchips. Instead, its engineers design chips, which are then licensed to larger technology companies like Qualcomm that pay ARM fees and royalties for manufacturing the chips.The company\u2019s revenue totaled a mere $1.5 billion last year, compared with $55.4 billion for Intel over the same period. But as ARM\u2019s chips have become increasingly powerful, the company\u2019s stable of customers have begun to create devices that directly compete with those powered by Intel. That can be seen in particular in the world of computer servers, which have become the lifeblood of the internet as people\u2019s online activities move into the cloud.As smartphone sales have slowed, ARM has invested millions of dollars in chip designs aimed at new customers, including automakers and household product companies, that are looking to add internet connectivity to their existing products.Mr. Son said he intended to double the number of employees at ARM in the next five years, and he said he would make that pledge a legally binding commitment enforceable by Britain\u2019s takeover panel.SoftBank had been signaling that it was preparing for a major move.Last month, Mr. Son reasserted control over SoftBank\u2019s overseas investment portfolio, easing out a former Google executive whom he had been grooming as his successor. In a statement announcing the departure of the executive, Nikesh Arora, Mr. Son said he had decided to stay on as SoftBank\u2019s chief for at least five or 10 more years.Until now, SoftBank has invested mostly in the services side of the technology business \u2014 internet companies like Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, and mobile phone carriers like Sprint and Vodafone, whose Japanese arm Mr. Son bought in 2006 and turned into one of Japan\u2019s dominant carriers.But abrupt changes in direction are part of SoftBank\u2019s DNA. Mr. Son founded the company in the 1980s as a distributor of computer software. When he broke into the mobile phone market with the Vodafone purchase in 2006, many predicted disaster \u2014 SoftBank lacked experience in the industry, and the $15 billion deal loaded it with debt. But the business, renamed SoftBank Mobile, soon became a cash cow.Raine Group, Robey Warshaw and Mizuho Securities advised SoftBank on the deal, while Lazard and Goldman Sachs advised ARM Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the terms of another large chip deal.

{"Headline": "Didi Chuxing and Uber, Popular in China, Are Now Legal, Too", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Ride-hailing services in China have attracted billions of dollars in investments. They have pulled in money from some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, like Apple and Alibaba. They have become a crucial road test for one of America\u2019s best-known start-ups, Uber.On Thursday, they finally became legal.In a new law announced by several regulators, China\u2019s government gave the thumbs-up for ride-hailing companies like Uber and its Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, to operate in the country. The law clears up regulatory uncertainty and lays out a new framework under which ride-hailing companies can operate in the country.Uber and Didi have upended China\u2019s taxi industry by allowing drivers to take passengers in private vehicles with the help of hugely popular apps. Despite investments in technology, marketing and subsidies, both companies had operated in a legal gray zone, with drivers occasionally being detained by the police.Strict government rules have repeatedly tripped up local and foreign internet companies in China. Yet in the fast-moving Chinese tech industry, an \u201cinvest first, get approval later\u201d model has prevailed. For Uber and Didi, it appears that ethos has paid off.Analysts said the new law, which will take effect on Nov. 1, signaled a step back from earlier, stricter proposals. According to the rules, drivers must have three years\u2019 experience, be licensed by a local taxi regulator and have no criminal record. Cars with more than 600,000 kilometers, or about 370,000 miles, on the odometer may not be used.Drivers were divided on what to make of the new rules. On one hand, they said in a chat group, it was a relief to see their job permitted by the government. On the other hand, the finer points of the law were unclear, leaving open questions like whether cars licensed outside Beijing would be allowed to take fares in the city.In an interview, a 31-year-old driver with the surname Liu, who did not give his full name because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the ride-hailing services, pointed out that the law did not address other concerns; many drivers have seen incomes cut nearly in half recently as Didi and Uber have reduced subsidies.That has been more painful to drivers who bought cars to take advantage of the big bonuses that had been offered. One man, Wen Zhenjiang, 37, quit a job driving Coca-Cola trucks from Beijing to the western city of Xi\u2019an and bought a Volkswagen to start driving for Uber and Didi.\u201cI will see how much I can earn,\u201d Mr. Wen said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t earn much, even if it\u2019s legal now, there\u2019s no point in doing it.\u201dHe added that he thought many drivers would fail the licensing process and that he was wary of the GPS tracking devices the new law says must be installed on their vehicles as a safety measure. Similar devices have led to limits on how much time drivers can spend on the road in trucking, he said.\u201cI know the tracking devices,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you install that and drive more than eight hours a day, you will be fined, and your company won\u2019t pay the fine.\u201dExperts said there was nothing in the law to validate Mr. Wen\u2019s concerns.Uber and Didi issued statements welcoming the regulation. In a note from the senior vice president of corporate development for Uber\u2019s Chinese arm, Zhen Liu, the company said it was \u201cregulation-ready\u201d and would be working with local authorities to put the regulations into practice.Didi said its drivers would begin applying for local licenses. Didi\u2019s statement praised elements of the rules, like the fact that ride-hailing companies will be allowed to set their own prices.Calling the new law a \u201cmilestone\u201d for China\u2019s sharing economy, Wu Shenkuo, a Beijing Normal University law professor, said he did not see any evidence that the law would specifically take aim at foreign companies. Still, he said, the companies must take care to comply with the rules, which will be put in place locally.\u201cCompanies need to adjust to the new law, especially in terms of applying for licenses, screening drivers and equipping cars,\u201d he said, adding that the law creates a model as China seeks to regulate new internet-based industries that conflict with existing businesses. Taxi drivers in China have held mass protests over ride-hailing apps, which they say are unfair competition.\u201cFrom what I can see now, it is very likely that companies will give out less subsidies, raise the rate up for car-hailing, and as a consequence, there might be fewer part-time drivers,\u201d he added.While Uber remains in the middle of a brutal pricing competition with Didi, which has more of the market, the rules to some degree validate the American company\u2019s willingness to flout regulations in new markets.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Ends an Era for a Web Pioneer", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo was the front door to the web for an early generation of internet users, and its services still attract a billion visitors a month.But the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterday\u2019s great idea, and Yahoo has now reached the end of the line as an independent company.The board of the Silicon Valley company has agreed to sell Yahoo\u2019s core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.That compares with Yahoo\u2019s peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is not expected to join Verizon, but she is due to receive a severance payout worth about $57 million, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.Verizon and Yahoo declined to comment on the deal.Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.For a long time, the model worked. It seemed as if every company in America \u2014 and across much of the world \u2014 wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured into Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival required a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancies, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.Ms. Mayer, who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief executive four years ago but failed to halt its decline, was nevertheless rewarded handsomely for her efforts. Including the severance, she will have received cash and stock compensation worth about $218 million during her time at Yahoo, according to Equilar\u2019s calculations.Created by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo was originally a hand-selected directory to the nascent World Wide Web, but it quickly expanded its ambitions.\u201cYahoo is where you start,\u201d Jeff Mallett, the company\u2019s first chief operating officer, explained during a 1996 interview with a job candidate, Dan Finnigan. Mr. Finnigan, now the chief executive of Jobvite, said that he was skeptical of Yahoo\u2019s quest to dominate every category of content, but he later joined the company to run its HotJobs division.Google, which emerged a few years later, used a superior, more automated approach to indexing the web. Under its first chief executive, Timothy Koogle, Yahoo struck a four-year deal with Google in June 2000 to make Google\u2019s search engine the default on its website. Yahoo\u2019s leaders also tried to buy Google but eventually settled on building their own search tool.While Google was singularly focused on search, Yahoo recast itself as a content company under its second chief executive, Terry Semel, who succeeded Mr. Koogle in 2001.Yahoo then went through two more chief executives and two interim bosses in about three years, before hiring Ms. Mayer, a former Google search executive and tech celebrity, in July 2012.Despite her acclaim, Ms. Mayer failed to resolve Yahoo\u2019s central problem: a lack of focus.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The Alibaba offering put pressure on Ms. Mayer to come up with a plan to distribute that windfall to shareholders and prove that her turnaround plan was working.\u201cShe knew she was holding a melting ice cube in her hand. Rather than focus on slowing down the rate it was melting, she said, \u2018Let\u2019s look three, four, five years out,\u2019\u201d said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Company, who has followed the company for a decade.Mr. Finnigan, the former Yahoo executive, said that in hindsight, the company tried to compete in so many areas that it was difficult to succeed.\u201cYou have to be Coke or Pepsi.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Is Said to Collect Final Bids as Auction Nears Its End", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The gavel is finally poised to drop in the drawn-out auction for Yahoo\u2019s core internet business.Final bids for the services, which include Yahoo\u2019s search, email, advertising and media operations, are due Monday, with the board set to make a decision soon afterward, according to people briefed on the process who asked for anonymity because the bidding was confidential.The sale of Yahoo\u2019s business would close out a largely unsuccessful four-year effort by Marissa Mayer, the company\u2019s chief executive, to turn around the internet company. Although Yahoo was once the place where many web users began their wanderings, it fell on hard times over the last decade through a series of strategic and managerial missteps. Although Yahoo\u2019s properties still draw more than one billion visitors a month, the company accounts for a tiny slice of the time people spend online.The bidders for Yahoo\u2019s operations include the telecommunications giants Verizon Communications and AT&T, several private equity firms and a Quicken Loans co-founder, Dan Gilbert, who is getting financial backing from Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.The offers are expected to vary depending on what assets are included, but Wall Street expects the business to fetch as much as $6 billion, including intellectual property and land.Though several bidders have acknowledged running into what one called \u201chairy\u201d issues, nothing has emerged as a deal breaker. People involved in the auction describe it as competitive.Any sale of Yahoo has been slowed by a trickle of unpleasant revelations to bidders about expensive decisions made by Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was named Yahoo\u2019s chief in July 2012.The biggest surprise: In late June, Yahoo told bidders that they could be on the hook for more than $1 billion in immediate payments to Mozilla, the company that makes the Firefox web browser.In a 2014 deal, Yahoo promised to pay Mozilla at least $375 million a year to make Yahoo the default search engine on Firefox \u2014 about $100 million a year more than Alphabet\u2019s Google unit was then paying for similar prominence, according to Yahoo and Mozilla filings.To sweeten the deal, Ms. Mayer personally negotiated a provision that gave Mozilla unusual leverage to demand all of remaining payments upfront if Yahoo were sold, according to people briefed on the terms of the contract.To demand the payout, Mozilla would have to show that the change in ownership was hurting the Mozilla brand and degrading the search experience, according to one of the people briefed on the terms. If Mozilla switched to another search provider instead, Yahoo would only have to make up the difference between its $375 million annual guarantee and the fee paid by Mozilla\u2019s new partner.The deal\u2019s provisions put pressure on any winning bidder to continue Ms. Mayer\u2019s heavy investments in search, which she has championed despite the long odds of success against Google. About 42 percent of Yahoo\u2019s $5 billion in revenue last year came from search.Yahoo decided the contract\u2019s provisions were not significant enough to disclose to shareholders, despite a series of letters last year from the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the company to lay out the terms of the agreement and the risks to Yahoo. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the dispute.A Yahoo spokeswoman, Rebecca Neufeld, declined to comment on the Mozilla contract or the broader sale process.Denelle Dixon-Thayer, the chief legal and business officer of Mozilla, said she could not discuss specific terms of the Yahoo contract because of a confidentiality clause, but she acknowledged that Mozilla had protected itself from \u201cdownside risk.\u201dMs. Dixon-Thayer said that when Mozilla switched to Yahoo from Google in 2014, its priority was making sure there was viable competition in search.\u201cThe most important thing to us is a focus on search, a focus on improving and building a search product that we can all be proud of,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to and want to see more innovation in search.\u201dBidders are also trying to determine how much they would have to pay out in severance if they cut staff. As of March 31, Yahoo had 9,400 employees, excluding those already scheduled to be laid off this year.Ms. Mayer and the board have handed out hefty stock awards to keep Yahoo employees from jumping ship over the last year and a half as the company has repeatedly shifted strategies.As of March 31, Yahoo had 35.5 million unvested restricted stock units outstanding. At the company\u2019s current stock price, those have a value of more than $1.3 billion. The company also had 5.4 million stock options outstanding.Yahoo\u2019s top four executives alone, including Ms. Mayer, would collectively receive about $100 million, including two years of stock awards, if they were fired. Rank-and-file employees would get their next six months of stock awards accelerated, and middle managers would get 12 months to 18 months.Brian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, estimates that Yahoo\u2019s operating business is worth $3.5 billion, but he said that whatever the final price, the sale would have little impact on Yahoo\u2019s stock price, which has already risen this year on speculation of a deal.\u201cInvestors just don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.Once any deal is announced, investors will turn their attention to the biggest issue affecting the stock: How will the remaining stub of Yahoo make money from its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company with a face value of $31 billion, and its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, worth about $9 billion? That process, fraught with complex tax and legal issues, could itself take many months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Verizon and Yahoo: Internet Also-Rans With Big Hopes", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsVerizon is continuing to invest in ancient web history. The telecom company on Monday said it was paying $4.8 billion to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business. It effectively justifies rival T-Mobile\u2019s tongue-in-cheek claim earlier this year that Verizon is having a midlife crisis. The Verizon boss, Lowell McAdam, after all, is betting the deal will help attract digital advertisers by meshing the internet-search firm with AOL, another 1990s highflier that Verizon bought last year.It is an appealing idea. Yahoo brings with it not just its search and advertising units, but also content like sports and finance that could play well with AOL\u2019s assets like The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. Verizon will also get its hands on Yahoo\u2019s 600 million monthly mobile users.Yahoo shareholders, though, have an exceptionally gloomy view of the business. It does not help that the division\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, is likely to be just $770 million this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from $2 billion a decade ago. But investors do not even reckon the units being sold are worth anything. The overall company has around $5 billion in net cash and owns stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that are worth some $41 billion, yet Yahoo\u2019s market value is just $37 billion.Mr. McAdam\u2019s vision ought to resonate on Madison Avenue. Advertising executives are nervous about the twin powers of Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which are expected to account for more than half of the American digital advertising revenue this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.They have shown little inclination to send more business to either of Verizon\u2019s dot-com 1.0 duo. Yahoo and AOL\u2019s collective slice of the $69 billion digital-ad market is expected to be 5.2 percent this year, eMarketer forecasts, and is likely to decrease to 4.8 percent in 2017.That has allowed Google and Facebook to gobble up most of the digital-advertising market. It may be that Tim Armstrong, who will run the combined AOL-Yahoo business, has a great plan to turn these two internet also-rans into a formidable force.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Failed Alibaba Spinoff May Benefit Other Deals", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCall it the \u201cYahoo rule.\u201d The internet company\u2019s failure to spin off Alibaba to shareholders could be a boon for future separations. The Internal Revenue Service has proposed modified regulations on when such splits can qualify for tax-free treatment. The move occurred after the I.R.S. declined to bless Yahoo\u2019s carve-out of its Alibaba stake last year. Similar deals have been delayed since.Yahoo did not know it was crossing the line in its proposed Alibaba deal. After years of wrangling over what to do with its valuable stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, Yahoo decided to spin off 15 percent and combine it with another small Yahoo operating unit. The government had given similar transactions a pass. But, recently, the Treasury Department has been cracking down on deals structured largely to avoid paying capital gains taxes.The I.R.S. declined to clear Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba transaction in September 2015, but it did not detail why. Tax officials were concerned about companies with small active businesses, like a hot-dog stand, being used to pursue larger asset spinoffs that were tax free. The I.R.S. also did not like the large nonbusiness assets of one company to be paired with smaller assets of another to distribute payouts.As a consequence, any companies considering similar transactions have been in limbo since the Yahoo ruling. Companies did not want to be caught in the same position as Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, who abandoned her Alibaba plans in December to avoid risking a $10 billion tax bill.The new rules set specific parameters for when certain spinoffs would not qualify for tax-free treatment. For the hot-dog stand example, an active business of five years would have to make up at least 5 percent of a company to receive that benefit. Nonbusiness assets that make up two-thirds or more of the company\u2019s value could not be combined with much smaller assets of another to distribute earnings to investors.Companies now know what lines they should not cross, and they have time to plan, especially because, for the most part, the rules will not apply until they are completed. This reasonable approach finally provides some much-needed clarity \u2013 if belatedly for Ms. Mayer\u2019s purposes.Advertisement"}

Yahoo got lucky with Alibaba, but failed to capitalize on its dominance by not acquiring companies like Google, Facebook and eBay. Spurning Microsoft also was a mistake. It is a one-company textbook on timing.Yahoo, the web creation of Jerry Yang and David Filo, captured the popular embrace of the internet back in 1994, and a large chunk of the internet\u2019s value along with it. Its market capitalization once exceeded $140 billion, and it even occupied the exclusive Boardwalk spot in a dot-com edition of the Monopoly board game. It failed, however, to anticipate how technology would supplant human curation of the web.Its overpriced stock was successfully deployed during the heady days of tech mayhem in the 1990s, but put to poor use. It spent $3.6 billion on the web-hosting service GeoCities and another $5.7 billion on the early internet-radio service Broadcast.com. Both services eventually faded away. Yahoo first ignored Google and then quibbled over a price tag that was lower than Broadcast\u2019s. Mark Zuckerberg likewise rejected a $1 billion offer for his fledgling Facebook.Yahoo kept showcasing its inverse Midas touch. The internet-ad auction firm Overture, the photo-sharing service Flickr and other promising start-ups simply were clouded by Yahoo\u2019s miasma.It is exceptionally tough to arrest a tech business in decline. The Alibaba deal, however, gave Yahoo the financial firepower to subsist for longer than it otherwise might have. In 2005, it contributed its own Chinese business and $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba, an investment now worth some $30 billion. The lack of self-awareness by the founders about Yahoo\u2019s faltering health, however, was its downfall. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo torpedoed the generous $45 billion takeover offer in 2008 from a then-panicky Microsoft.In the end, Yahoo may have managed to gin up a frothier auction than it deserved and thus fetched an outsize price from Verizon. It will be little consolation given what might have been. At least Yahoo has left behind a case study in M.&A. that should be of significant value.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Mr. Armstrong said the acquisition strengthens Verizon\u2019s offerings to advertisers and consumers and gives it much more scale, since Yahoo claims one billion users who visit at least once a month.\u201cThis deal is a leap forward from serving millions of customers to billions,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said in an interview. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands on the planet.\u201dVerizon plans to keep most of Yahoo\u2019s current products, including its still popular email service, and invest in them to make them stronger. \u201cOur strategy is to structure ourselves as a house of brands,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. However, he said that Verizon has not yet decided what it wants to do in search, an area where Yahoo has waged a losing fight against Google for a decade.The Yahoo purchase carries risks for Verizon, which is well known for its wireless phone and internet services but has little experience in the cutthroat business of digital content. Analysts say that its purchase of AOL has yet to prove its value, although Mr. Armstrong is a well regarded operator.Ms. Mayer said Verizon would help Yahoo get better distribution for its mobile apps in areas like search, mail, news, weather and sports.
