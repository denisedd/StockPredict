{"Headline": "Gretchen Carlson Suit Against Fox News Head Forces Network to Face Changing Mores", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byMediatorAt a time of fast-moving social change, Fox News can at times be viewed as a port in a storm for traditionalists who pine for the way we were \u2014 for the days when there was no gay marriage; no terms like \u201cgender fluidity\u201d; no doubt about the roles men and women were supposed to play and certainly no talk about the liberties men might take with female subordinates behind closed doors.With the gender discrimination suit filed against the network\u2019s chairman, Roger Ailes, this week, Fox, too, is being carried by the same gale force that is sweeping through Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue, bringing into the open generations-old patterns and behaviors that were never O.K., but were for so long abetted by silence.Fox News has strenuously denied the allegations by Gretchen Carlson, a former host, that Mr. Ailes offered a smoother path at the network in return for sex, portraying her as a former employee with an ax to grind. And Ms. Carlson\u2019s legal team will have the burden of proving the veracity of the accusations, along with its claim that other women are considering stepping forward as well. (As of Thursday night, none had.)Even if Mr. Ailes wins, the developments \u2014 especially the way it was handled by the new generation of Murdochs now gaining control of 21st Century Fox \u2014 signal a big shift for Mr. Ailes and a network that has avowedly refused to go along with what so many of its commentators dismiss as political correctness and feminism run amok in the name of progress.Respect and equality in the workplace don\u2019t represent political correctness anymore, if they ever did. They are the cornerstones of modern human resource policies used by sophisticated companies. Mr. Ailes is not just bumping up against an annoyance he can wave away, he\u2019s confronting a new world order, something Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, understood when they issued a statement about the lawsuit saying, \u201cWe take these matters seriously\u2019\u2019 and would conduct an internal review.Wrapped up in all of it is the future of Mr. Ailes, who through his own cunning, mastery of television and, in a former life, politics, has made his network a singular force within the Republican Party and, therefore, in the national political dialogue.Mr. Ailes\u2019s very approach to television \u2014 as the quintessential visual medium \u2014 has stood as a rebuke to those who might be sensitive to signs of female objectification. His sets are famous for their translucent desks, which show the legs of his female stars who are so often in skirts.Ms. Carlson, the Fox anchor, says that Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, fired her from the network after she refused his sexual advances.On Thursday, several Fox News stars questioned Ms. Carlson\u2019s motives. \u201cShe\u2019s disgruntled she didn\u2019t get her contract renewed and the timing is very suspicious,\u201d the Fox host Greta Van Susteren said in a telephone interview. Asked about the behavior Ms. Carlson described, Ms. Van Susteren said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here 15 years I haven\u2019t seen it and frankly I\u2019m rather outspoken and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d stick around for it.\u201dIn a similar vein, a Fox News weekend host, Jeanine Pirro \u2014 a former prosecutor and judge who has known Mr. Ailes for 30 years \u2014 told me, \u201cThis is something that is totally inconsistent with the man I\u2019ve known probably longer than most people who work in that building.\u201dFox News shared with me handwritten thank-you notes they said Ms. Carlson wrote after the meeting in which, she says, Mr. Ailes propositioned her. In one of them she tells Mr. Ailes, \u201cI\u2019d love to stay at Fox.\u201dBut for all that, there were a couple of articles in the last two days quoting former female staff members \u2014 albeit anonymously \u2014 echoing Ms. Carlson\u2019s descriptions of Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior and the overall climate at Fox.A few years ago, Mr. Ailes might have been free to defend himself with the unquestioned support of his like-minded longtime patron, Mr. Murdoch, who has stood by him as Mr. Ailes has brought in huge revenue \u2014 an estimated 20 percent of the total profits for 21st Century Fox for fiscal 2016, according to Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura Securities.But Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sons have different political and corporate sensibilities than their father. They began taking increasing control of the family\u2019s publicly traded business after it took steps to move the corporate culture away from the pirate-ship mores for which it was known, before a phone-hacking scandal at its newspaper division in Britain threatened its future.So the world is changing. The question now is how Fox News and Mr. Ailes change with it.Emily Steel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taser International Dominates the Police Body Camera Market", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byWhen Micah Johnson went on a deadly shooting rampage in Dallas last week, body cameras worn by police officers were rolling, capturing at least 170 hours of video of the mayhem.That footage is now stored on a sophisticated cloud computing system that lets police manage digital evidence and hosts more hours of video than Netflix has available to stream.These paired offerings \u2014 body cameras for police and cloud storage \u2014 have transformed policing in recent years, adding a new level of transparency and accountability but also raising questions about privacy and who has the right to view those videos.Behind the scenes, one company is at the center of it all: Taser International. Best known for making Taser stun guns, it controls about three-quarters of the body camera business in the United States.Until recently a one-note provider of electrical weapons, Taser has swiftly cornered the market for body cameras and related software, making it one of the most important suppliers of technology to law enforcement today.Its Axon body cameras are worn by officers in dozens of big cities including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington and, yes, Dallas. And using computing power from Microsoft and Amazon, Taser runs Evidence.com, the site that lets police host and manage body camera video.Demand for the products has soared in the two years since Michael Brown was shot dead by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., and analysts now estimate that the market will soon be worth $1 billion a year.\u201cWhen the rest of us are snapping pictures and videos, police can\u2019t pull out a note pad and start writing,\u201d said Patrick W. Smith, the chief executive of Taser. \u201cThere\u2019s now an expectation from society that they\u2019re getting good documentation of what they\u2019re involved in. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to know what happened.\u201dMr. Smith and his brother, Thomas, founded Taser in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1993, and the company now is worth about $1.3 billion. Taser cameras have captured thousands of altercations between the police and the public and several controversial police shootings, including ones in Albuquerque and Cincinnati.Yet as Taser works to sell cameras and software to more departments, it is coming under fire for questionable business practices. In some instances, it has paid police chiefs to travel to Taser conferences. In other cases, chiefs who have bought Taser products have joined the company as consultants shortly after leaving public service. And several cities have awarded contracts to Taser without competitive bidding.So far, these issues have done little to blunt Taser\u2019s momentum. Last quarter, for the first time, Taser booked more sales for body cameras and related software than it did for its stun guns.Interest in body cameras was already picking up two years ago, as police departments around the country started responding to calls for greater accountability. Then, in August 2014, a white police officer killed Mr. Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson. The officer was not wearing a body camera, and witnesses disputed his account of the altercation that led to the shooting. The officer was not charged, and critics said that had he been wearing a body camera, the outcome might have been different.At times, the video can exonerate officers. In 2009, shortly after Taser began selling its cameras through its Axon division, Sgt. Brandon Davis shot and killed a man in Fort Smith, Ark. Video recorded by his body camera captured the shooting, and Mr. Davis was cleared of wrongdoing.In other instances, the footage can portray police as needlessly aggressive. In 2014, a Taser Axon camera worn by an officer in Albuquerque captured the fatal shooting of a homeless man by officers who did not appear to be threatened. The two officers have been charged with second-degree murder and are expected to stand trial soon.Even when body cameras are worn, they are not always effective. When two police officers fatally shot Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., on July 5, they were wearing body cameras made by a Taser competitor. A police spokesman said the cameras became dislodged during the altercation with Mr. Sterling, and the video was unlikely to reveal much; Baton Rouge is making a transition to Taser cameras.In another incident last week, the officer who killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn., was not wearing a body camera. But Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live.\u201cThe whole world wants to know what the heck happened in the moments leading up to that shooting,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Taser. \u201cWould a body camera have changed the behavior? Maybe. But it sure would have answered some questions.\u201dJust a few years ago, many police were reluctant to wear body cameras, fearing that their every action would be scrutinized.\u201cThere was a real hesitation at first,\u201d said Officer Jeff Garwacki, who oversees the body camera program at the Fort Worth Police Department.But as the devices have become more common, many police officers have come to rely on them. In Fort Worth, which has bought 800 body cameras from Taser and uses its Evidence.com service, Mr. Garwacki said most officers wanted to wear cameras at all times. \u201cThe body cameras are showing that the officers are doing what they say they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen police use body cameras and tell people that they are using them, it tends to produce better behavior by both the police and the public,\u201d said Chad Marlow, advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.Yet Mr. Marlow expressed concern that Taser had achieved such dominance in the body camera industry so quickly.\u201cThe fact that a lot of police departments are familiar with Taser has created an inclination to go with them,\u201d said Mr. Marlow. \u201cOther companies are not getting the opportunity to show off their products.\u201dSome of Taser\u2019s rivals, Mr. Marlow said, were developing software that made it easier to redact identifying features of people captured on camera, better protecting their privacy.There is no doubt that Taser has managed to use its longstanding relationships with police departments, which have used the company\u2019s stun guns for decades, to gain its early lead in the market for body cameras and related software.But several competitors, and some city officials, accuse the company of cozying up to police chiefs to secure lucrative contracts. Nearly all of the roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States have bought Taser\u2019s stun guns. \u201cTaser is very much intertwined with police departments,\u201d said Mark Strouse, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.In several instances around the country, Taser has either paid for the travel of police chiefs who went on to award the company contracts, or hired recently retired chiefs who had awarded Taser contracts.\u201cWe think there\u2019s an ongoing pattern of police chiefs getting lucrative consulting contracts after they retire, if they give Taser contracts,\u201d said Robert McKeeman, chief executive of Utility, which makes a rival body camera.Taser defended its sales tactics, saying they were commonplace, and said that many police departments were familiar with the company. It now makes law enforcement officials wait a year after leaving government service before it will hire them as consultants. Taser also said that while it was sometimes awarded sole-source bids, the departments doing the purchasing have often run a competitive process to test other cameras.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to solve customers\u2019 needs, you have to have close relationships,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything that was misleading.\u201dThe company struggled for several years. Ill-fated brand extensions like the Auto Taser, a device that electrified steering wheels to prevent car theft, nearly bankrupted the company.But sales picked up when Taser introduced a powerful electrical weapon, the M26, which resembled a handgun. Taser went public in 2001.The company began selling video recorders that worked with Taser weapons in 2006, and it introduced its first body camera, the Axon Pro, in 2009.Mr. Smith predicted that sales of Axon cameras and Evidence.com would soon dwarf sales of Taser\u2019s weapons, and that the company would one day be renamed to reflect the growing prominence of its body camera business.\u201cWe had a very successful business selling Taser weapons,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World According to \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "FeatureThe show\u2019s creators have turned the travails of an anthropomorphic horse into a hilarious meditation on a peculiarly modern kind of unhappiness.Supported byThe first story described how Theodore Roosevelt handed the presidency to William Howard Taft. Displeased with Taft\u2019s performance, Roosevelt made a bid to regain the White House in 1912, which ended in a humiliating defeat. \u201cHe goes from being the most important person in the world to being a kind of fool,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. Roosevelt soon redeemed himself by embarking on a journey down a remote river in the Amazon. Eisner related Roosevelt\u2019s story to his own career: \u201cFor 40 years, I\u2019m the most important man in the room, and all of a sudden I thought the phone is never going to ring.\u201dWhich led him to his second parable of the evening, a tale about a figure somewhat less well known than the 26th president: the protagonist of an animated TV show that Eisner\u2019s production company, Tornante, had sold to Netflix. The show, \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d is about an anthropomorphic horse living in Los Angeles who suffers with existential, career and substance-abuse issues after the death of his sitcom.\u201cBoJack wants you to think he\u2019s still the most important person in the room,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. \u201cBut deep down, he knows he\u2019s not, and that is killing him.\u201d He tries to write his memoirs, but can\u2019t get started. Paparazzi birds torment him. He endures a withering mare of a mother and a Harvard-educated, name-dropping former writing partner named Cuddlywhiskers. He betrays everyone who tries to love him.The lesson for Bloomberg? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be sure you\u2019re not going to be embarrassed,\u201d Eisner said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t go dark.\u201dIt helps that \u201cBoJack\u201d is also funny. In the tradition of great melan-comedy predecessors like \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d and \u201cLouie,\u201d \u201cBoJack\u201d bites the hand that feeds it. Eisner claims the show is not just a Hollywood satire (\u201cNo one watches those\u201d), but it is centered on the travails of an actor for whom the trappings of success \u2014 money, a convertible, nubile fans \u2014 don\u2019t begin to make up for his has-been status.Superficially, the show is full of Sitcom 101 characters. There\u2019s the millennial wastrel Todd, who moved into BoJack\u2019s house, a modern monstrosity perched on a hill, five years ago and does nothing but eat breakfast cereal and smoke weed. There\u2019s Princess Carolyn, BoJack\u2019s ex/agent/sex buddy whom he disappoints not just romantically but also professionally, turning down every project she brings him. There\u2019s even a built-in frenemy, Mr. Peanutbutter, a yellow lab whose own former show, \u201cMr. Peanutbutter\u2019s House,\u201d was a rip-off of BoJack\u2019s long-running sitcom, \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around,\u201d in which he starred with three lovable orphans. But the characters on \u201cBoJack\u201d are deeper, and more complex, than those descriptions suggest. Todd, as his voice actor, Aaron Paul, says, may be \u201cthe first asexual character on television,\u201d and his loyalty to BoJack is often rewarded with heartbreaking indifference. Princess Carolyn is whip-smart, but her window to have kittens is closing; this she periodically regrets, blaming BoJack. And the more we watch Mr. Peanutbutter, the more apparent it is that, despite his career thievery, he\u2019s the simplest and most decent character on the show. All are at once infatuated with and repelled by BoJack.Still, for all this misanthropy and unremitting bleakness, BoJack retains our sympathy, especially as we see him wrestle with the damage inflicted by his twisted childhood. The offspring of a plow horse and a moody equine heiress to a sugar fortune, BoJack is raised primarily by network television, which he watches incessantly, even as his mother lectures him about how life is nothing but a pile of road apples. Like Sanders, BoJack just wants to be loved. The penultimate episode of the first season ends with BoJack\u2019s confronting the ghostwriter of his memoirs with an aching plea: \u201cI need you to tell me that I\u2019m a good person. ... Please, Diane, tell me that I\u2019m good.\u201d Before she can answer, a heckler interrupts, and the screen goes black.It\u2019s easy to assume that \u201cBoJack\u201d had its origins in the creative travails of 40-something television writers. But the idea actually sprang from the youthful angst of the show\u2019s creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg. Bob-Waksberg and his two younger sisters were raised in Palo Alto, Calif., by what he calls \u201ctwo professional Jews.\u201d His father helped Russian Jews emigrate from the Soviet Union; his mother owned a Jewish bookstore with his grandmother. He insists that his parents were the opposite of the stereotypically hard-charging Palo Alto parent \u2014 to whom some attributed the spate of suicides that have rocked Bob-Waksberg\u2019s high school in recent years \u2014 but he still struggled.He was repeatedly kicked out of class for being disruptive. When the principal refused to let him wear his beloved cycling cap in a school picture, he retaliated by shaving half his head on the quad. (He\u2019d already done the other half, which had given him a disturbing half-cherub-half-psycho look.) He missed field trips because he was sent to the principal\u2019s office so many times and ran with a group of \u201clike-minded weirdos,\u201d moving through the hallways with a frenetic, loud energy.There was a downside to his teenage charisma. Bob-Waksberg often pushed his jokes over the line, making his sister Becky and friends cry in frustration. \u201cI definitely have people who I went to high school with who would call me a bully,\u201d said Bob-Waksberg, who, at 31, still has the intense, spritelike energy of an adolescent. \u201cI would find something and tease them, which in my mind was harmless fun. And then they would go home and be like, Why is he so mean to me?\u201dAcademically, he floundered, but he sometimes won the lead in the school\u2019s theater productions, which led to his hanging out with a girl named Lisa Hanawalt, now the production designer and a producer on \u201cBoJack.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d riff on ideas for a TV show based on people we knew,\u201d Hanawalt remembers. \u201cWe\u2019d use that to make fun of them. Like, \u2018Oh, what if our friend was a pirate and he had a chicken on his shoulder instead of a parrot?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe two parted for college \u2014 Hanawalt, first, to U.C.L.A., then Bob-Waksberg to Bard \u2014 but stayed in touch, working on a comic via email. Within a decade, Hanawalt was a critically acclaimed illustrator and comics artist and Bob-Waksberg was making his way in Hollywood writing scripts, including one about three liars that morphed into a pilot about triplets. In 2010, he finally had an idea he really wanted to pursue, and he emailed Hanawalt.\u201cHey, do you have a picture of one of your horse guys, by himself? I came up with this idea for a show I\u2019d like to pitch. Tell me what you think: \u2018BoJack, the Depressed Talking Horse.\u2019\u2009\u201dAt first, Hanawalt thought the BoJack idea sounded sad and cynical, but she liked the horse part. As a kid, Hanawalt was so obsessed with horses that she sometimes walked on all fours. Her classmates called her Horse Poop and Lady Horse. After graduating from U.C.L.A., she cre\u00adated a comic book called \u201cExtra Egg Room\u201d about He-Horse, an anxiety-ridden horse. In another, she created She-Moose, an artist moose who lives with her boyfriend, a cat. She didn\u2019t draw on computers, so she did a series of watercolors of the main characters for \u201cBoJack.\u201d She advised Bob-Waksberg to make everything more animal-centric, suggesting that a Newton\u2019s Cradle in Princess Carolyn\u2019s office be strung with clanging mice instead of balls. BoJack\u2019s look came to her almost instantly \u2014 a mournful horse, too young to be wearing the Cosby sweaters he favors. She envisioned Diane as a bookish, Janeane Garofalo type. Hanawalt and her staff also provided many of the show\u2019s punning touches. Princess Carolyn\u2019s bookshelf includes the titles \u201cPurrity\u201d and \u201cPurrsepolis.\u201d Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s estate features a fire hydrant and countless portraits of dog butts and tennis balls.But BoJack still lives in a harsh realm. In the first five minutes of the first episode, he shows up drunk to a \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d interview and defends \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around.\u201d \u201cI think the show is actually pretty solid for what it is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not Ibsen, sure, but look \u2014 for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra. Sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes everything is going to turn out O.K.\u201dBob-Waksberg manages a staff of nearly 100, but he drives a silver Prius that Eisner gave him after it became clear he would never dump his beat-up Dodge. He is a slight man, who despite his biting humor still cries at Hallmark-card commercials; his blue eyes dart constantly, as if he\u2019s thinking three moves ahead. He and Arnett eventually got down to reading lines for a scene in which BoJack thinks he has nabbed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Secretariat in a biopic. BoJack should be ecstatic, but told of the nomination, he just mutters, \u201cI feel the same.\u201dArnett read the line a few times in BoJack\u2019s most-important-horse-in-the-room baritone before Bob-Waksberg interrupted.\u201cSay it disappointed and weirded out.\u201dArnett added a pause and a note of bewildered anguish.\u201cI feel ... the same.\u201dThey moved on to the next line, which Bob-Waksberg asked Arnett to do with \u201cmore bouncy energy. \u2018It\u2019s happening again. Jesus Christ, I\u2019ll never be happy. Typical me.\u2019\u2009\u201dArnett nods.\u201cIt\u2019s happening again. ... Why do I always think things will make me happy?\u201dBob-Waksberg jolted his head up. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dWhen Arnett finished recording, he told me that what drew him to BoJack was that the horse was kind of a jackass. \u201cI love a flawed character more than anything.\u201dSuddenly, an eager assistant bolted through the door. She wanted to make sure Arnett\u2019s lunch order had been taken.\u201cThat was so Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got interrupted having a real conversation and asked what we wanted for lunch.\u201d We talked about the show for a while before Arnett steered the conversation to the crushing nature of Hollywood. \u201cThe brass ring here is so shiny and so big, and the possibilities endless. So people come here because they want to be a star, whatever that means \u2014 that is the pinnacle. So when it doesn\u2019t happen, bad things tend to happen.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see myself having grandchildren with her,\u201d he replied, with BoJackian dourness.\u201cI love Raphael,\u201d Conover, who now has his own comedy show on TruTV, told me. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy being a Mr. Peanutbutter type, because having that BoJack mentality where you\u2019re constantly processing things can\u2019t be easy.\u201dBut this churning over the meaning of existence has always defined Bob-Waksberg\u2019s comedy. In Olde English, an absurdist comedy troupe he and Conover joined at Bard, Bob-Waksberg often played the role of a clueless yet self-righteous millennial. The group was successful and cutthroat; it would meet often to jettison members who weren\u2019t carrying their weight, with one member ordered to deliver the blow. \u201cThe ultimate pejorative was if you came up with something and someone else described it as corny,\u201d Bob-Waksberg says.After graduating, the Olde English crew migrated to New York and tried to develop ideas. Before calling it quits, they produced some co\u00admedic gems, including a film called \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d a twist on the Surrealists\u2019 parlor game. Each member wrote 15 pages of the script, but the next member saw only the last five. The result is a glorious mess of tone changes and character U-turns interspersed with snippets of commentary. Bob-Waksberg\u2019s section features a speech delivered from a Santa Monica beach days after he moved to Los Angeles. Wearing a tie, he wonders about the project before going global:\u201cHere\u2019s the problem with everything. As soon as you get something you want \u2014 it\u2019s no longer a thing you want, it\u2019s just a thing you have, and then you want the next thing. So I\u2019m starting to realize maybe I\u2019ll never be satisfied. ... I\u2019ll find the girl of my dreams, I\u2019ll get married and I\u2019ll have kids. Then, like a week later, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, this is [expletive].\u2019\u2009\u201dThen a heckler with a football jumps in the frame and ruins the take.The episode opens with scenes of Charlotte\u2019s domestic bliss. When BoJack arrives, he says he\u2019s in town for the Santa Fe boat show and \u2014 to make the lie believable \u2014 buys a yacht that he parks in the driveway. Bob-Waksberg asked an assistant to freeze the screen.\u201cWe knew things were going to break bad here, but the idea was he was going to sleep with Charlotte,\u201d he recalled. Then someone in the writers\u2019 room suggested that BoJack try to bed Penny instead. \u201cOnce that was said out loud, sleeping with Charlotte just felt so boring and expected,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that genie back in the bottle.\u201d I asked him if he polled any outsiders about whether a middle-aged depressive trying to sleep with a high-school senior was over the line. He thought for a second. \u201cA friend left her sweater here, and her assistant came to pick it up, and we asked if it was too much, and she said, \u2018No, I\u2019d go with it,\u2019 and that was it.\u201dAs the episode unfolds, BoJack takes Penny for driving lessons. He contemplates staying and teaching theater at a local college, but this idea is never mentioned again. (The subplot that goes nowhere is something of a Bob-Waksberg trademark.) BoJack magnanimously offers to drive Penny and some friends to the prom. He teaches them that they don\u2019t have to fit in, but then he gets one of them drunk and dumps her at the E.R. with alcohol poisoning. Still, Penny is having a magical evening and is the one to make the first move.\u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m ready, I have condoms in my room, and I know how to put one on with my mouth.\u201d\u201cLast stop for gas,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said, as we watched. \u201cThat\u2019s the last joke of the episode.\u201dBoJack brushes her off and finds Charlotte out back. He tries to talk her into abandoning her family for him. Charlotte tells BoJack he has to leave, not because she is angry but because he makes her too sad. \u201cYou think she says go because he\u2019s messing up her life,\u201d Bob-Waksberg told me. \u201cBut then she goes to this other, existential place \u2014 that\u2019s such a broader critique of BoJack.\u201dBoJack retreats to his boat and finds Penny waiting for him.

Classic Mike.Point is, we\u2019re going mobile, and ARM has been the best positioned to provide for that future for a long time. SoftBank made a very smart offer.So, what do you think?So Tesla\u2019s strategy seems to be coming from one end of the spectrum rather than the other. Companies like Uber, Lyft and the overseas competitors are busy creating the network from the ground up. That is, they\u2019re plowing money into recruiting drivers and riders \u2014 spinning the flywheel, as one Uber exec told me a while back \u2014 to fully stock up on supply and demand. And they\u2019re doing a good job of it, it seems: Both are unicorns many times over.This Tesla plan essentially seems to come at it from the other end. Build the fleet of cars, but perhaps allow your customers to do much of the real-world testing of how cars adapt to the road \u2014 including using the \u201cautopilot\u201d function, and then autonomous driving comes later on down the line.What I\u2019m curious about is how Tesla builds a network-effect-type service that companies like Uber and Lyft now have critical mass on. Can that come later when the autonomous vehicles are out there? Or do they not even care about a sort of transportation service and just want to give their customers the outright ability to drive hands-free, without worrying about creating an Uber-like demand?The more I think about it, the more I wonder if Uber and Tesla would merge or at least partner somewhere down the line. Uber wants to go autonomous, but I don\u2019t know how it gets there without building its own fleet as well.But that raises some problems: If you don\u2019t need to own a Tesla to ride in one, why would anyone buy one? And also, since as you note this is a network-effects business \u2014 where the biggest fleet will have accelerating advantages in price and efficiency \u2014 why would anyone share their car in Tesla\u2019s fleet rather than in Uber\u2019s, which has a big head-start in sharing?And I think that gets to the bigger problem with Musk\u2019s master plan. It seems a little all over the place, and in many ways far exceeds what Tesla seems capable of doing. Let\u2019s note, after all, that Musk hasn\u2019t even hit all the milestones on his first master plan yet.But I guess setting big, impossible goals is pretty much the point of a visionary master plan.

{"Headline": "How Companies Like Dollar Shave Club Are Reshaping the Retail Landscape", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThe world might be a mess, but look on the bright side: Men\u2019s shaving products are much better than they used to be.This column usually focuses on the technology industry, an area that sounds far removed from shaving. But the Dollar Shave acquisition signals something bigger than a mere improvement in shaving \u2014 it also underscores a consumer products revolution that would not have been possible without technology.For you and me, this is a boon. By cutting out the inefficiencies of retail space and the marketing expense of TV, the new companies can offer better products at lower prices. We will get a wider range of products \u2014 if companies don\u2019t have to market a single brand to everyone on TV, they can create a variety of items aimed at blocs of consumers who were previously left behind. And because these companies were born online, where reputations live and die on word of mouth, they are likely to offer friendlier, more responsive customer service than their faceless offline counterparts.With Casper, you simply buy the mattress online and it\u2019s shipped to you in a comically small box (the compressed foam expands into a full-sized mattress, like a magic trick). You have three months to try it out, and if you don\u2019t like it, the company will come pick it up free.Casper\u2019s business model offers a break from the annoyance of offline mattress shopping. It also works out for the company. Casper advertises on social networks, on Google, podcasts and a variety of other places online; the ads are creative, convincing, targeted and cheap. By selling directly rather than through retail middlemen, the company also creates a connection with customers that allows it to test and develop new products \u2014 it now sells sheets and pillows, too.Value destruction could be on the table. But there\u2019s another view that new online brands could unlock profits through products aimed at people who are not well served by incumbents.Unlike Dollar Shave, Mr. Walker does not aim to compete with traditional consumer product companies on price alone. \u201cWe want to build a very profitable business,\u201d he said. He will do so, he said, by fostering a deep, lifelong connection with an audience that is getting wealthier and more influential \u2014 and whose influence, thanks to social networks, can now be tapped.\u201cGlobal culture is led by American culture, which is led by black culture in the U.S. \u2014 look at music, dance, et cetera,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re catering to an audience that are the most culturally influential demographic group in the world, we can use the internet to promulgate our message across the board, whether it\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram \u2014 and that gives us amazing leverage.\u201dWalker & Company declined to provide sales numbers; a spokesman said revenue had grown 300 percent over the last year.\u201cWe\u2019re offering a solution to busy parents that\u2019s just not out there in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Carbonell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about some new style every day, it\u2019s something you can count on.\u201dIt\u2019s striking how few of these online companies could have taken off in the presocial age. At the very least, they would have been sunk by the inability to target ads to the demographics they\u2019re aiming to serve.\u201cLook at Dollar Shave,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads and business platform, told me. \u201cThey were just trying to reach men. If they\u2019d started advertising on TV, they definitely would have wasted half their money.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the job title of Andrew Bosworth at Facebook.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.A big part of what has made Amazon\u2019s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon\u2019s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers \u2014 the warehouses from which it processes customer orders \u2014 in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year.Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon.\u201cI would not take our financial results as an indication we\u2019re running out of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to really prove out their profitability,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Amazon\u2019s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results.The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business.The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing.Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google.Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company\u2019s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.The company\u2019s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\u201cThey are defying the laws of gravity,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt shows their level of market share gains is increasing.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings misstated the number of consecutive quarters in which Amazon has shown a record profit. It is three, not two.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Mexico, Narco Films vs. Narco Reality", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byMexico City \u2014 It was a television executive\u2019s nightmare: Not only was someone threatening to sue over a TV series, but that person was reputedly the biggest drug trafficker on the planet and the head of a cartel behind a long string of mass executions and torture videos.The declarations put the show\u2019s producers in a predicament. If they go ahead with the series, due in 2017, they could face a legal battle \u2014 and the possibility that, should he lose, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n might seek retribution out of court. But if they get into negotiating with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, they face other problems. Would they be cooperating with organized crime? El Chapo\u2019s lawyer suggested that he could help make the TV series better by giving details no journalist had yet dug up. But could that mean acting as a propaganda instrument for a crime boss?The quandary reflects bigger dilemmas in the growing world of narco fiction. Dramatic portrayals of Mexican crime kings, which began as zany B-grade movies, have evolved into wildly popular soap operas, best-selling novels and major Hollywood productions. They are part of a wider narco culture, ranging from pop-music ballads to fashion trends. Meanwhile, from 2007 to 2014 more than 80,000 Mexicans were killed by cartel-related violence, according to a government count. May was the most murderous month in Mexico in almost four years.Mexico\u2019s narco-films took off with the straight-to-video technology of the 1980s, often shot in a couple of weeks and starring real-life strippers, real guns and real criminals firing them. Titles like \u201cThe Big Bazooka Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Elite Narco Commando\u201d and \u201cScarface Reborn\u201d are popular in Mexican communities in the United States. Some traffickers finance their own biopics: When Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as La Barbie, was arrested in 2010, he told the police that he had given producers $200,000 to make a movie about him.The narco action film first made its way into the more popular and better-produced telenovelas in Colombia in the mid-2000s, before expanding to Mexico at the end of the decade. Local TV networks made hits like \u201cSin Tetas No Hay Paraiso\u201d (\u201cWithout Breasts, There Is No Paradise\u201d) and \u201cEl Cartel de Los Sapos\u201d (\u201cThe Cartel of the Snitches\u201d), which was based on a book by a real Colombian trafficker who was imprisoned in the United States. They worked well, featuring a gritty realism while maintaining the glamour and entertainment value of Latin soaps.Last year, the drug war made its big break into the mainstream American media market with the release of the Oscar-nominated movie \u201cSicario,\u201d the Netflix series \u201cNarcos\u201d and the best-selling novel \u201cThe Cartel,\u201d by Don Winslow. All have been commercial and critical hits, despite protests by the mayor of Ju\u00e1rez against \u201cSicario\u201d for portraying his city in a bad light. The success of \u201cNarcos,\u201d which paints a largely true picture of the Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar, paved the way for Netflix to work on production of the \u201cEl Chapo\u201d series.Mexican politicians slam narco culture for glamorizing, and even feeding, the blood-soaked trade. Writers, producers and singers retort that they are merely documenting reality. But increasingly, the line between life and art is blurring.The line between fact and fiction may have disappeared entirely when it emerged that Ms. del Castillo had brought the actor Sean Penn to meet Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, a trip that Mr. Penn later recounted in Rolling Stone. Pundits speculated that Ms. del Castillo had become consumed by her role on \u201cLa Reina del Sur,\u201d or that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had fallen in love with her telenovela character. It was also revealed that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had promised the exclusive film rights of his story to Ms. del Castillo, raising further questions about Netflix\u2019s effort.But just because it makes for a good story, is it one that Netflix should be telling? There\u2019s certainly a risk of glorifying narco life; I have interviewed several gang members, and they will often say they watch narco soaps and movies. I even went into a prison in the border city of Nuevo Laredo to find that a crime boss being held there had a life-size photo of Al Pacino from \u201cScarface\u201d on his wall. But it\u2019s harder to say whether narco fiction contributes to the violence in Mexico \u2014 millions of people watch these same films and don\u2019t go around decapitating victims on video.Still, producers of narco fiction do struggle with this question. \u201cOh, my God, do I wrestle with that,\u201d Mr. Winslow told me last year. \u201cAt the end of the day, I tilt toward the side of, \u2018By informing people, we are doing good.\u2019 But in the day by day writing of some of these things, I would wonder, \u2018Am I tripping across a line? And am I simply doing a pornography of violence? Is this just voyeuristic?\u2019 \u201dIt\u2019s a question that Netflix and Univision need to ask themselves over the coming year. Assuming Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is extradited to the United States, he could also go on trial or make a deal, a real-life drama that could play out while the series airs. With so much in flux, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n could well come out a celebrity, a modern-day Al Capone or John Dillinger. Even if it inspires only a handful of people to follow his lead, is that worth the ratings?Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

And for the fifth consecutive year, the networks were shut out of nominations for best drama.HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep,\u201d which last year ended the five-year winning streak of ABC\u2019s \u201cModern Family\u2019\u2019 in the best comedy category, was once again nominated for that award. It will go up against \u201cModern Family\u201d again, along with Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cblack-ish\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None.\u201dWith Jon Hamm\u2019s Don Draper from \u201cMad Men\u201d out of the race, the best actor category for drama has no clear front-runner. Two previous Emmy winners, Kyle Chandler (\u201cBloodline\u201d) and Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d), will compete against Kevin Spacey (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d), Liev Schreiber (\u201cRay Donovan\u201d), Matthew Rhys (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) and Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d), all of whom are looking for their first Emmy.Viola Davis, who last year became the first African-American woman to win a best acting Emmy in the drama category, will try to repeat, for her performance in \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder.\u201d She is up against Robin Wright (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d), Keri Russell (\u201cThe Americans\u201d), Tatiana Maslany (\u201cOrphan Black\u201d), Claire Danes (\u201cHomeland\u201d) and Taraji P. Henson (\u201cEmpire\u201d). Ms. Russell is the only new actress in the category, and this represents her first Emmy nomination.FX\u2019s Emmy haul was propelled by \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cThe Americans.\u201d\u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d received a whopping six nominations in the limited series acting categories, including one for Sarah Paulson, who was also nominated for her role in FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Hotel.\u201d Ms. Paulson, who portrayed the prosecutor Marcia Clark in \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d said in an interview that she shot both roles at the same time and that she was \u201crunning on fumes, just as Marcia was.\u201dShe added, \u201cI used all of my exhaustion to my benefit since no one was more tired during that trial than Marcia Clark.\u201dAnother standout on Thursday was three-time Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf, who was nominated for three awards: for best actress in a comedy series for HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On\u201d and for guest appearances in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cHorace and Pete.\u201dNetflix had a strong day, with nominations in both the lead drama and comedy categories and in several acting categories. With 54 nominations, Netflix has 20 more than it received last year, its previous record. \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d the popular Netflix documentary, was nominated for six awards, including best documentary series.This is the first year that Netflix eclipsed each of the broadcast networks.Amazon was led by its comedy \u201cTransparent,\u201d which had 10 nominations. Last year, the show\u2019s star, Jeffrey Tambor, won the best actor award, the first time a streaming service had won a lead acting Emmy.For the first time in 16 years, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was not nominated in the best variety show category, a blow to its rookie host, Trevor Noah. Likewise, Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d was snubbed, while Mr. Corden\u2019s \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d was honored instead. The nomination will add fuel to the discussion that Mr. Corden is outshining his more experienced CBS colleague.Rounding out the category were HBO\u2019s John Oliver, ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel, HBO\u2019s Bill Maher, NBC\u2019s Jimmy Fallon and Crackle\u2019s \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d with Jerry Seinfeld.Unlike the Academy Awards, which have overhauled the membership ranks following controversy over its all-white slate of acting nominees, the Emmys have a relatively diverse lineup, with a number of actors of color receiving nominations.In the comedy acting categories, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus is up again for her performance in \u201cVeep.\u201d She has won the award four years in a row (and has seven Emmys over all). She will be competing against Ms. Metcalf, Amy Schumer (\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d), Lily Tomlin (\u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d), Tracee Ellis Ross (\u201cblack-ish\u201d) and Ellie Kemper (\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d).Mr. Tambor will be up against Anthony Anderson (\u201cblack-ish\u201d), Aziz Ansari (\u201cMaster of None\u201d), Will Forte (\u201cThe Last Man on Earth\u201d), William H. Macy (\u201cShameless\u201d) and Thomas Middleditch (\u201cSilcon Valley\u201d).The Emmys will be hosted this year by Mr. Kimmel and will be broadcast on Sept. 18 on ABC.An article on Friday about the Emmy nominations omitted a nominee for best actress in a drama. Besides Viola Davis, Robin Wright, Keri Russell, Tatiana Maslany and Claire Danes, the nominees also included Taraji P. Henson.Jeremy Egner contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s primal.\u2019\u201dThe pint-size Ms. Ryder storms through \u201cStranger Things\u201d (available for streaming on July 15), generating what Matt and Ross Duffer, the twins who created the series, described as an essential \u201cWinona-ness,\u201d an air of fragility and feisty determination. \u201cShe has a very intense energy about her, Winona does, a wiry unpredictability, a sort of anxiousness that we thought we\u2019d really lean into,\u201d Matt Duffer said about what inspired the brothers to incorporate some of Ms. Ryder\u2019s traits.Back in the late \u201980s and through much of the \u201990s, Ms. Ryder, whose godfather was the LSD enthusiast Timothy Leary, was a sort of emblem of cool: dating Johnny Depp and the Soul Asylum frontman Dave Pirner and inspiring an \u201980s punk band to call itself the Wynona Riders. According to the Duffers, 32, online reaction to the trailer for \u201cStranger Things,\u201d which is set in the \u201980s, revealed a deep nostalgia for Ms. Ryder. \u201cIt\u2019s the Winona Forever fans, there\u2019s just a lot of them,\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cShe\u2019s such an icon. She certainly hasn\u2019t been forgotten.\u201d He rattled off some of Ms. Ryder\u2019s greatest hits, including two of Tim Burton\u2019s films, \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands.\u201d \u201cWe grew up on her movies. We were hoping that if we wanted so desperately to see her onscreen that other people would feel that, too.\u201d\u201cI think for me, personally, it was good for my soul and stuff to be M.I.A.,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the big picture, I see it as something that opened the door for me to get away. All I\u2019d ever done was act.\u201dMs. Ryder retreated to San Francisco, where she was raised and owns a house, to be near her parents and a vast community of friends. She has been in a long-term relationship with Scott Mackinlay Hahn, a founder of the fashion label Loomstate. In conversation, she\u2019s something of a meanderer, often switching topics midthought or not finishing her sentences. But in reflecting on the aftershocks of the scandal, Ms. Ryder stayed on course.\u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll forever be associated with that. Definitely.\u201d But, she added, \u201cIn the grand scheme of things it wasn\u2019t exactly the crime of the century.\u201dLast year, however, when she was cast as the tough-talking Yonkers council member Vincenza Restiano, in the politically charged TV mini-series, \u201cShow Me a Hero,\u201d creator David Simon repeatedly cautioned her to leave entrenched mannerisms at home. \u201cHe said it, like, three times: \u2018Don\u2019t show us the Winona eyes,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Ryder. \u201cAfter I wrapped, he said something to me to the effect of \u2018We really showed them.\u2019 And it actually hadn\u2019t occurred to me that he\u2019d actually had to fight for me, that HBO was hesitant, that I just wasn\u2019t the obvious choice for the role.\u201dIf there is a consensus among her friends and colleagues, though, it\u2019s that the slow pace of Ms. Ryder\u2019s return might also have something to do with her attitude toward show business. \u201cShe\u2019s not like some actors who crave and need the spotlight \u2014 Winona\u2019s life is full and broad,\u201d said Shawn Levy, who produced \u201cStranger Things.\u201dAs Daniel Waters, a longtime friend who wrote the screenplay for \u201cHeathers,\u201d said: \u201cShe\u2019s not going to put up a periscope and go looking for work \u2014 she just waits until it washes up on the beach. I think of her as the last connection to old Hollywood. She has all that glamour that\u2019s lost today, that\u2019s been pummeled by Instagram and TMZ. She inspires a kind of cultist love that I don\u2019t see other ing\u00e9nues inspiring. Audrey Hepburn used to send her clothes. \u201dMs. Ryder has also rediscovered parts of fame she may not have missed. Recently, a reporter for Time magazine asked her to comment on allegations that Mr. Depp abused his wife, Amber Heard. (In a court filing, Mr. Depp\u2019s lawyer said Ms. Heard was \u201cattempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.\u201d)These days, though, with her new series, talk of a \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d sequel and her appearance in the spring as the new face of Marc Jacobs\u2019s cosmetic line, there\u2019s a sense that she\u2019s back on track, if the careers of classic Hollywood stars are any indication.\u201cI love watching old movies, and I read a lot of autobiographies,\u201d Ms. Ryder said. \u201cApparently Bette Davis and a lot of actresses had a hard time in their 30s, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What does Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential nomination mean to average voters, die-hard Democrats and Bernie or Busters? We asked a few here in Philadelphia.Irvine, Calif.Ms. Ali grew up in Pakistan, and as a teenager voted for Benazir Bhutto \u2014 the first woman elected to lead a majority Muslim country. She said being able to vote for Mrs. Clinton now, as a United States citizen, was \u201chistory in the making.\u201d (The presidential election isn\u2019t the only one she is focused on this year; she is also a candidate for Irvine\u2019s City Council.)\u201cShe is the most qualified candidate to lead us in this very toxic environment full of hate, full of terrorism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also want her as a woman now, if she\u2019s elected, to really look at the Muslim world in the eye \u2014 including Saudi Arabia \u2014 and say, \u2018Give women equal rights.\u2019\u201dPhiladelphia\u201cI see this week as a historical week because we\u2019re here in Philadelphia, where history was made 240 years ago, and now we\u2019re in the process of history again,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cI believe that this country is overdue for that kind of change.\u201dHe said President Obama did an \u201camazing job\u201d in his Wednesday night speech passing the baton to Mrs. Clinton.\u201cIt was moving. It was provocative. It brought me to tears,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife and I sat down on the couch and literally cried because we know that it\u2019s not easy being the president, and being a man of color and president.\u201dPhiladelphia\u201cShe\u2019s very qualified when you go through her r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cSo I\u2019m excited.

She was also in Cleveland protesting the nomination of Donald J. Trump, whom she called \u201cdespicable.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m delighted that we may have a woman president \u2014 that goes without saying,\u201d she said of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way she got the nomination.

{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 2, Episode 4: The Man in the Mask", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byMr. RobotIn the opening flashback scene, set immediately before the events of the first season, Elliot and Darlene celebrate an impromptu family reunion by watching a fictional slasher film called \u201cThe Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie.\u201d (Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Tobe Hooper, call your lawyers.) It turns out that movie\u2019s rich-kid-targeting killer wore the moneyman mask eventually embraced by fsociety as its symbol. Sure enough, when Elliot tries on a copy provided to him by his sister as a gag, the monster is unleashed. His posture straightens, his low-energy voice grows raspier and more strident, his Rs harden and his vowels sharpen into the distinctive vocal cadence of the actor Christian Slater. Elliot\u2019s not here anymore \u2014 we\u2019re looking at and listening to Mr. Robot.The transformation\u2019s so striking that I wondered if the two performers\u2019 voices had been digitally blended; I might have thought the actors themselves had been switched, if Mr. Malek\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t so big and bright they could be seen clearly through the eyeholes of the mask. The horror movie orchestral music cue that accompanies the appearance of the \u201cMr. Robot\u201d logo in the credits completes the uncanny effect.For Elliot, the episode reveals more than just his dark side. As it has several times this season, Mr. Malek\u2019s restrained performance pays dividends any time he shifts his delivery style \u2014 that teary breakdown in his therapist\u2019s office, for example, as he recites all the ways his mental illness has adversely affected his life. (\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize my own sister\u201d is particularly poignant in its simplicity.) Later, after a conversation with Leon, his \u201cSeinfeld\u201d obsessed friend, about the need to dream up a better future for oneself, he does exactly that.As a lullaby version of Green Day\u2019s \u201cBasket Case\u201d plays, Elliot envisions his happy ending: a world in which he\u2019s surrounded by supportive friends and family, from Angela and Darlene, to Leon, to the Wellicks, to the members of fsociety (though ominously not Romero, whose death Elliot supposedly does not know about yet), even to the hapless security guard at E Corp\u2019s data facility whom he cruelly bullied in one of the first season\u2019s most unpleasant scenes. Together they sit down for an outdoor dinner and applaud as (with shades of \u201cFight Club\u201d) a skyscraper collapses in the distance; the battle he\u2019s waging, in other words, isn\u2019t just to destroy the system, but to ensure a happier future for everyone after the fall. There\u2019s sweetness and optimism here, however entwined with cynicism and pessimism it might seem.Yet for all of its paranoiac pyrotechnics, \u201cMr. Robot\u201d is arguably at its best when chronicling more quotidian aspects of its characters\u2019 lives. Yes, the flashback scene reveals the origin of fsociety\u2019s iconic mask and debuts Elliot\u2019s Mr. Robot persona. But it also beautifully captures the peculiar rhythms of having a conversation while stoned, from Darlene waxing rhapsodic about the power of the bad movie they\u2019re watching to Elliot\u2019s heavy-lidded, slow-motion drawl. Back in the present, when Darlene and her hacker ex-boyfriend have sex in a bar bathroom, he divulges secret information about her dead colleague Romero\u2019s investigation of the Feds. While she\u2019s surprised and disturbed, she\u2019s also irritated at this deeply lousy pillow talk.And in one of the episode\u2019s most incongruously serene sequences, Angela stands outside the E Corp building as the corrupt executives her boss Philip helped her expose are led out in handcuffs; the daily-affirmation recording she\u2019s listening to at the time (\u201cAll of my dreams are coming true right now. All of my dreams are coming true right now\u201d) transforms the scene around her into something totally different, in a fashion familiar to anyone with a decent pair of headphones.But it\u2019s not just our heroes who are humanized in this way \u2014 the bad guys and power players have their workaday concerns as well. The Dark Army leader Whiterose has grand but frustrated plans for E Corp, the F.B.I., and god knows what else, but these are alluded to in a scene where she\u2019s equally bedeviled by the choice of which earrings to wear. Even Joanna Wellick, the azure-eyed masochist who spends much of the episode trying to get her hands on her murderous husband\u2019s severance package, has a cringingly relatable moment when she tries to reassure the guy she\u2019s dating that his lack of money and prospects are exactly what she likes about him. This is finely observed character work, sewn seamlessly into the larger story line.By the time Elliot takes up his cyber-sword once more, agreeing to help his shady pal Ray with a website migration in order to contact his sister and hack the F.B.I. himself, we\u2019re back on the firm first-season ground of internet espionage \u2014 but what a journey. From sunlit dream sequences and sterile corporate plazas to creepy slasher pastiches and grimy dive-bar restrooms, \u201cMr. Robot\u201d is unified by its audacious framing, its astute use of sound, and performances that withhold as much as they reveal. This show speaks in a cinematic language as original and distinctive as any since the grand-guignol beauty of Bryan Fuller\u2019s \u201cHannibal.\u201d That horror-movie opening couldn\u2019t be more appropriate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Watching Doping Scandal, Fourth-Place Olympian Asks, \u2018Am I a Bronze Medalist?\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byKatie Uhlaender was a three-time United States Olympian when she competed at the Sochi Games in February 2014. She was seeking her first Olympic medal, and after four runs down an icy 1.1-mile skeleton course, she was sure she had succeeded.She had not. She placed fourth, finishing four-hundredths of a second behind Elena Nikitina of Russia, who took third.\u201cMy gut just got all wrenchy,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said recently, tears welling up as she slowed her pedaling on a stationary bike. \u201cIt\u2019s opening a wound.\u201dDr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account of how doping controls were breached at the 2014 Olympics has tarnished the performance of dozens of Russian athletes and marred the integrity of the Games. His claims also have left many athletes who finished behind Russians feeling cheated.\u201cI\u2019ll never know what it feels like to stand on the podium in Sochi, but I want to put this behind me,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cI want to know: Am I a bronze medalist?\u201dMs. Nikitina\u2019s name appears on a spreadsheet provided to The New York Times by Dr. Rodchenkov. The document, which he said was sent to him by Russia\u2019s sports ministry two weeks before the Sochi Games, lists key competition dates for each athlete \u2014 in Ms. Nikitina\u2019s case, Feb. 14, the date of her final two races, in which she had some of the fastest running starts at the Games.In a preliminary report last month, Mr. McLaren, who received the Sochi spreadsheet, called Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s story \u201cboth credible and verifiable.\u201dIn an interview in Moscow this week, Mr. Mutko denied that the government had been involved in any scheme, but expressed concern that his deputy was accused of giving Dr. Rodchenkov direct orders.Mr. Mutko was alternately confident in Russia\u2019s athletes and contrite about their attitudes toward performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cWe have to persuade people you can win without doping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture. It\u2019s a problem.\u201dWaiting for the Sochi inquiry to conclude, Ms. Uhlaender, who will turn 32 next week, has fought to keep her focus on the next Winter Olympics, in 2018 in South Korea. Still, she is concerned that sports officials will fail to deliver the rigorous and decisive result she craves.\u201cI\u2019m worried Sochi will be forgotten, and it scares me,\u201d she said. \u201cRodchenkov said he tampered with the samples, and there are rules against that. I just want to see them follow the rules.\u201dMs. Uhlaender is training in the desert, spending her days lifting weights in Arizona with fellow professional athletes at a high-performance gym and sprinting alongside dozens of other Olympians, mostly track and field athletes preparing for Rio.Between workouts, there is conversation of all kinds \u2014 about high-fat diets, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the price of gas \u2014 but there is little mention of the allegations of widespread doping by the Russians.Ms. Uhlaender said she had talked about the situation twice with her coach. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d he asked her before moving on.\u201cThe worst thing I can do is talk about it,\u201d she said over a chicken lettuce wrap and four shots of espresso. When not training, she meditates; works in education for a traumatic brain injury center, having recovered from a concussion herself; watches Netflix; and exchanges texts with two Navy SEAL friends who have helped keep her tough, she said.\u201cWhen I come to train, I don\u2019t want drama,\u201d she said, fiddling with a National League championship ring belonging to her father, the former baseball player Ted Uhlaender. The ring, which she tucks into the back of her sports bra as she works out, hangs on a silver chain alongside a tiny baseball charm that holds his ashes.One of the few people Ms. Uhlaender has talked to about the doping scandal in recent months is Ms. Nikitina, her Russian competitor. In May, days after Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account became public, Ms. Uhlaender and Ms. Nikitina exchanged more than a dozen messages on Facebook.Ms. Nikitina expressed shock at Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s statements. \u201cWe all think this is politics!\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe basically joke about it.\u201dShe added: \u201cEach athlete sure of himself! As we say in Russia, \u2018Such complex situations make us stronger.\u2019\u201dMs. Nikitina, who did not respond to messages from The Times, told Ms. Uhlaender her name was not on Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s spreadsheet, and she emphasized the sacrifices she had made to train twice a day to become a better athlete.When Ms. Uhlaender asked if Russian Olympians had doped at Sochi, Ms. Nikitina said that she could speak only for skeleton racers, and that the answer was no. Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s spreadsheet listed five Russian skeleton athletes, including Alexander Tretyakov, who won gold at the Games.Asked about the allegations this year, the Russian Bobsled and Skeleton Federation wrote in an email that all of its athletes \u201cunderwent doping control procedures in accordance to the rules,\u201d adding, \u201cAll of them were clean, and not one positive result was found.\u201dMr. Mutko said in Moscow this week that Mr. Tretyakov and other accused athletes had long careers with clean histories. \u201cThese athletes didn\u2019t appear in sport all of a sudden,\u201d he said. \u201cNo whiskey would be enough to stop them,\u201d he said, referring to the mixture of steroids and liquor that Dr. Rodchenkov said he developed and distributed to coaches to help Russian athletes absorb drugs more quickly before traveling to international competitions for testing.Mr. Mutko said, however, that if Mr. McLaren\u2019s inquiry proved Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account true, the athletes in question would be disciplined.\u201cI am not on the list!\u201d Ms. Nikitina wrote to Ms. Uhlaender in a recent exchange. \u201cI hope that the truth will prevail! And the perpetrators of this scandal will be punished!\u201dMedalists like Ms. Nikitina received high praise for their performance at Sochi. After the Games, President Vladimir V. Putin presented Ms. Nikitina, a first-time Olympian, with a state award, the Order for Merit to the Fatherland.Regardless of what may come of the investigation, Ms. Uhlaender called herself more determined than ever to work toward the only major title she has yet to capture in her 13-year career. \u201cI want to win Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m first, I\u2019ll know no one ahead of me doped.\u201dShe said she felt sympathy for Ms. Nikitina, whether or not the claims against her were substantiated. \u201cShe\u2019s going through something, too,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cThe shininess has been dulled for both of us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marie Kondo, Tidying Up and the Ruthless War on Stuff", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "FeaturesThe star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cTidying Up\u201d and author of \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d is training an army of emissaries to declutter the American home.Supported byUpon entering the Japan Society, the 93 Konverts in attendance (and me) were given lanyards that contained our information: our names, where we live and an option of either the proud \u201cTidying Completed!\u201d or the shameful \u201cTidying Not Yet Completed!\u201d In order to be considered tidy, you must have completed the method outlined in Kondo\u2019s book. It includes something called a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime tidying marathon,\u201d which means piling five categories of material possessions \u2014 clothing, books, papers, miscellaneous items and sentimental items, including photos, in that order \u2014 one at a time, surveying how much of each you have, seeing that it\u2019s way too much and then holding each item to see if it sparks joy in your body. The ones that spark joy get to stay. The ones that don\u2019t get a heartfelt and generous goodbye, via actual verbal communication, and are then sent on their way to their next life. This is the crux of the KonMari \u2014 that soon-to-be-trademarked nickname \u2014 and it is detailed in \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic\u201d and her more recent book, \u201cSpark Joy,\u201d which, as far as I can tell, is a more specific \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d but with folding diagrams. She is often mistaken for someone who thinks you shouldn\u2019t own anything, but that\u2019s wrong. Rather, she thinks you can own as much or as little as you like, as long as every possession brings you true joy.By the time her book arrived, America had entered a time of peak stuff, when we had accumulated a mountain of disposable goods \u2014 from Costco toilet paper to Isaac Mizrahi swimwear by Target \u2014 but hadn\u2019t (and still haven\u2019t) learned how to dispose of them. We were caught between an older generation that bought a princess phone in 1970 for $25 that was still working and a generation that bought $600 iPhones, knowing they would have to replace them within two years. We had the princess phone and the iPhone, and we couldn\u2019t dispose of either. We were burdened by our stuff; we were drowning in it.[Marie Kondo now has a show on Netflix called \u201cTidying Up.\u201d Read about it here.]People had an unnaturally strong reaction to the arrival of this woman and her promises of life-changing magic. There were people who had been doing home organizing for years by then, and they sniffed at her severe methods. (One professional American organizer sent me a picture of a copy of Kondo\u2019s book, annotated with green sticky notes marking where she approved of the advice and pink ones where she disapproved. The green numbered 16; the pink numbered more than 50). But then there were the women who knew that Kondo was speaking directly to them. They called themselves Konverts, and they say their lives have truly changed as a result of using her decluttering methods: They could see their way out of the stuff by aiming upward.At the Japan Society event, we were split into workshop groups, where we explained to one another what had brought us here and what we had got out of \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u201d Most of the women at the event could not claim \u201ctidying completed!\u201d status; only 27 in the room did, or less than a third. One woman in my group who had finished her tidying, Susan, expressed genuine consternation that a bunch of women who wanted to become KonMari tidying consultants hadn\u2019t even \u201ccompleted tidying!\u201d How were they going to tidy someone else\u2019s home when they couldn\u2019t even get their own in order? How could they possibly know how profoundly life could improve if they hadn\u2019t yet completed their tidying?A woman named Diana, who wore star-and-flower earrings, said that before she tidied, her life was out of control. Her job had been recently eliminated when she found the book. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful message for women that you should be surrounded by things that make you happy,\u201d she said, and her and everyone else\u2019s faces engaged in wide-eyed, open-mouthed incredulous agreement, nodding emphatically up and down, skull to spine and chin to chest. \u201cI found the opposite of happiness is not sadness,\u201d Diana told us. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos.\u201d Another woman said she KonMaried a bad boyfriend. Having tidied everything in her home and finding she still distinctly lacked happiness, she held her boyfriend in her hands, realized he no longer sparked joy and got rid of him.During her lecture, Marie demonstrated how the body feels when it finds tidying joy. Her right arm pointed upward, her left leg bent in a display of glee or flying or something aerial and upright, her body arranged I\u2019m-a-little-teacup-style, and a tiny hand gesture accompanied by a noise that sounded like \u201ckyong.\u201d Joy isn\u2019t just happy; joy is efficient and adorable. A lack of joy, on the other hand, she represented with a different pose, planting both feet and slumping her frame downward with a sudden visible depletion of energy. When Kondo enacted the lack of joy, she appeared grayer and instantly older. There isn\u2019t a specific enough name for the absence of joy; it is every emotion that isn\u2019t pure happiness, and maybe it doesn\u2019t deserve a name, so quickly must it be expunged from your life. It does, however, have a sound effect: \u201czmmp.\u201dJoy is the only goal, Kondo said, and the room nodded, yes, yes, in emphatic agreement, heads bobbing and mouths agape in wonder that something so simple needed to be taught to them. \u201cMy dream is to organize the world,\u201d Kondo said as she wrapped up her talk. The crowd cheered, and Kondo raised her arms into the air like Rocky.When she was 19, her friends began offering her money for her tidying services. At the time, she was enrolled at Tokyo Woman\u2019s Christian University, studying sociology, with a concentration on gender. She happened upon a book called \u201cWomen With Attention Deficit Disorder,\u201d by Sari Solden, and in it there was a discussion over women who are too distracted to clean their homes. Kondo was disturbed that there was little consideration that a man might pick up the slack in this regard, that a woman with A.D.D. was somehow broken because she couldn\u2019t tidy. But, she conceded, buried in this outrageous notion was a core truth: that women have a closer connection to their surroundings than men do. She realized that the work she was doing as a tidying consultant was far more psychological than it was practical. Tidying wasn\u2019t just a function of your physical space; it was a function of your soul. After college she found work at a staffing agency but continued to take tidying jobs in the early mornings and late evenings, initially charging $100 per five-hour block. Eventually she quit her job, and soon, even working at tidying full time, the wait list for her services reached six months.When she enters a new home, Kondo says, she sits down in the middle of the floor to greet the space. She says that to fold a shirt the way everyone folds a shirt (a floppy rectangle) instead of the way she thinks you should (a tight mass of dignified envelope-shaped fabric so tensile that it could stand upright) is to deprive that shirt of the dignity it requires to continue its work, i.e. hanging off your shoulders until bedtime. She would like your socks to rest. She would like your coins to be treated with respect. She thinks your tights are choking when you tie them off in the middle. She would like you to thank your clothes for how hard they work and ensure that they get adequate relaxation between wearings. Before you throw them out \u2014 and hoo boy will you be throwing them out \u2014 she wants you to thank them for their service. She wants you to thank that blue dress you never wore, tell it how grateful you are that it taught you how blue wasn\u2019t really your color and that you can\u2019t really pull off an empire waist. She wants you to override the instinct to keep a certain thing because an HGTV show or a home-design magazine or a Pinterest page said it would brighten up your room or make your life better. She wants you to possess your possessions on your own terms, not theirs. (This very simple notion has proved to be incredibly controversial, but more on that later.)She is tiny \u2014 just 4-foot-8. When I interviewed her, not only did her feet not touch the ground when we were sitting, but her knees didn\u2019t even bend over the side of the couch. When she speaks, she remains pleasant-faced and smiling; she moves her hands around, framing the air in front of her, as if she were the director on \u201cElectric Company\u201d or Tom Cruise in \u201cMinority Report.\u201d The only visible possessions in her hotel room for a two-week trip from Tokyo were her husband\u2019s laptop and a small silver suitcase the size of a typical man\u2019s briefcase. She has long bangs that obscure her eyebrows, and that fact \u2014 along with the fact that her mouth never changes from a faint smile \u2014 contributes to a sense that she is participating in more of a pageant than an interview, which possibly is what it does feel like when big-boned American interviewers whose gargantuan feet do touch the ground come to your hotel room and start jawing at you through an interpreter. Her ankles are skinny but her wrists are muscular. When she shows pictures of herself in places she has tidied, before she starts, she looks like a lost sparrow in a tornado. On the other side, in the \u201cafter\u201d picture, it is hard to believe that such a creature could effect such change.Her success has taken her by surprise. She never thought someone could become so famous for tidying that it would be hard to walk down the street in Tokyo. \u201cI feel I am busy all the time and I work all the time,\u201d she said, and she did not seem so happy about this, though her faint smile never wavered. She sticks with speaking and press appearances and relegates her business to her handlers \u2014 the team of men who pop out of nowhere to surround any woman with a good idea. She feels as if she never has any free time.Kondo does not feel threatened by different philosophies of organization. \u201cI think his method is pretty great too,\u201d she told me later. She leaves room for something that people don\u2019t often give her credit for: that the KonMari method might not be your speed. \u201cI think it\u2019s good to have different types of organizing methods,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause my method might not spark joy with some people, but his method might.\u201d In Japan, there are at least 30 organizing associations, whereas in the United States we have just one major group, the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO). Kondo herself has never heard of NAPO, though she did tell me that she knows that the profession exists in the United States. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to anyone in particular, but what I\u2019ve heard is that thanks to my book and organizing method, now the organizing industry in general kind of bloomed and got a spotlight on it,\u201d she said, though I cannot imagine who told her this. \u201cThey kind of thanked me for how my book or method changed the course of the organizing industry in America.\u201dWhen you receive your Conference lanyard, you can add sticky ribbons to it that say anything from your level of participation in NAPO (chapter president, former board member, golden circle, NAPO Cares, etc.) to where you\u2019re from (a choice of the 41 states represented) to what your state of mind is (Diva, Lazy, High Maintenance, Happy to Be Here, Really?, Caution: Might Burst Into Show Tunes!). Once you are completely categorized, you can enjoy Conference.At Conference, I met women who organize basements. I met women who organize digital clutter. I met women who organize photos. I met women who categorized themselves as \u201csolopreneurs,\u201d which, what\u2019s that now? I met a woman who organizes thoughts, and please don\u2019t move onto the next sentence until you\u2019ve truly absorbed that: I met a woman who charges $100 per hour for the organization of thoughts. I heard the word \u201cdetritus\u201d pronounced three different ways. I met a woman in camouflage (though the invitation begged us to confine ourselves to our native business-casual), who carried a clipboard and called herself Major Mom, and instead of an organizer she calls herself a liberator, like in Falluja.I went to a seminar on closets and pantries that I hoped would be, I don\u2019t know, more spiritual than it was, or at the very least address the problem of the cans of beans I keep buying and not using \u2014 why do I keep buying them? Why am I not using them? Beans are a superfood, after all, and cheap, too. I like beans. But the woman droned on and on and on about shelving units and the pesky corner cabinets, how they misuse valuable space, but luckily there is a drawer or something that could help you fill that space, too, because negative space inside a cabinet is a crime no organizer worth her drawer dividers should find herself guilty of.Conference was different from the KonMari events that I attended. Whereas Kondo does not believe that you need to buy anything in order to organize and that storage systems provide only the illusion of tidiness, the women of Conference traded recon on timesaving apps, label makers, the best kind of Sharpie, the best tool they own (\u201csupersticky notes,\u201d \u201cdrawer dividers\u201d) and the best practices regarding clients who wouldn\u2019t offer their organization goals in a timely manner. I heard about the crises in the industry: that clients who printed out Pinterest pages and said, \u201cI want that,\u201d had unrealistic expectations; that the baby boomers are downsizing for the first time; that there is a rising generation that isn\u2019t interested in inheriting their parents\u2019 old junk.While NAPO members don\u2019t share any standardized method for organizing \u2014 the group offers certification classes, but each woman I spoke with has her own approach \u2014 they are fairly unified in their disdain for this Japanese interloper. They have waged a war through their fuming blog posts and their generally disgusted conversations, saying that she is a product only of good marketing, that she\u2019s not doing anything different from what they\u2019ve been doing since she was in diapers. They don\u2019t like that there\u2019s a prescribed order for tidying; they think you have to yield to what your client wants done and has time for. They don\u2019t like the once-in-a-lifetime tidying marathon, which on average is completed in six months; sometimes organizing is a many years effort or an ongoing one. They don\u2019t like that she hasn\u2019t really addressed what to do with all your kids\u2019 stuff and how to handle them. They don\u2019t like that you have to get rid of all of your papers, which is actually a misnomer: Kondo just says you should limit them because they\u2019re incapable of sparking joy, and you should confine them to three folders: needs immediate attention, must be kept for now, must be kept forever.At the opening-night cocktails/trade show, I stood in front of the booth of a man advertising his cleaning service, which can tidy up crime scenes as well as hoarders\u2019 homes, and I asked some women eating spring rolls what they had against Kondo. The nice ones, struggling for something that wasn\u2019t overtly bitchy to say, said they appreciated that the popularity of her book has brought attention to their industry, which still lobbies to be recognized by the government as an official occupation. (Until that happens, the NAPO women will have to continue calling themselves \u201cinterior designers\u201d or \u201cpersonal assistants\u201d; they would prefer \u201cproductivity consultants.\u201d) But they also feel as if they\u2019ve been doing this for years, that \u201cshe just has one hell of a marketing machine, but she\u2019s doing nothing that\u2019s so different from us,\u201d at least three of them said to me.Yet each organizer I spoke with said that she had the same fundamental plan that Kondo did, that the client should purge (they cry \u201cpurge\u201d for what Kondo gently calls \u201cdiscarding\u201d) what is no longer needed or wanted; somehow the extra step of thanking the object or folding it a little differently enrages them. This rage hides behind the notion that things are different here in America, that our lives are more complicated and our stuff is more burdensome and our decisions are harder to make.\u201cIt\u2019s a book if you\u2019re a 20-something Japanese girl and you live at home and you still have a bunch of your Hello Kitty toys and stuff,\u201d another NAPO member told me, which, while not the only thing a professional organizer told me that was tinged with an aggressive xenophobia and racism, it is the only one that can run in a New York Times article.They even hate Kondo\u2019s verbiage. The word she uses, \u201ctidying,\u201d is annoying and arcane to them. \u201cTidying is what you do before your mother-in-law comes over,\u201d said one woman, while her two friends nodded. In addition, what Kondo offers is limited. Ellen Faye, the president of NAPO, told me the night before: \u201cYou know, I have a client who got me the book, who said, \u2018Here, Ellen, read the book.\u2019 I did page through it. I think her first book is kind of like the grapefruit diet; that there\u2019s nothing wrong with just eating grapefruit. It\u2019s not going to get it all done. I mean grapefruit\u2019s great for losing weight, and what she says is great for bringing order to your life, but it\u2019s not the whole picture. It\u2019s just a narrow slice.\u201dUltimately, the women of NAPO said that Kondo\u2019s methods were too draconian and that the clients they knew couldn\u2019t live in Kondo\u2019s world. They had jobs and children, and they needed baby steps and hand-holding and maintenance plans. They needed someone to do for them what they couldn\u2019t naturally do for themselves.At the lounge, which included space for mindful coloring, I suggested to the organizers present that maybe the most potent difference between Kondo and the NAPO women is that the NAPO women seek to make a client\u2019s life good by organizing their stuff; Kondo, on the other hand, leads with her spiritual mission, to change their lives through magic. With her rigid once-in-a-lifetime tidying marathon directive (no baby steps, no \u201cslow and steady wins the race\u201d), she is a little like the grapefruit diet: simple and extreme and incredibly hard, the way Americans like our renewal plans.A woman who was coloring heard my theory and rolled her eyes. Her name was Heather Ahern, an organizer in Massachusetts for nearly 13 years, and she deals mostly with a clientele who were surviving something hard: divorce, death, loss \u2014 when, for example, their loved ones have no idea how to access any of their online accounts and delete them. \u201cDo you know how many dead people are on LinkedIn?\u201d she asked me. (The correct answer to this is not: I don\u2019t know, all of them?) \u201cFor some of my clients, just making it better is O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a perfect house. There is no perfect house.\u201d But Kondo would agree with that.\u201cI guess it\u2019s the process,\u201d Ahern said of what bothers her most about Kondo. Ahern\u2019s philosophy is about process as much as about results. \u201cI see that my clients are just too fragile to do that,\u201d she said. We got up to go back to our rooms to briefly abandon our business-\u00adcasual for formal in preparation for the Black and White Ball, where the NAPO women would cut loose as much as their personalities would allow them by doing karaoke to Eminem and dancing to \u201cBaby Got Back.\u201dLast year, when Kondo visited San Francisco, she came to Ning\u2019s studio apartment, and Ning said she felt very ashamed when Kondo opened her closet. Kondo would visit San Francisco again to introduce the consultancy and maybe even before, and Ning told me she wanted to tidy and to show Kondo the progress. I asked if I could come along and maybe help Ning complete her tidying.When Ning was little, she loved to collect things: stamps, stickers, pencils. She was never overwhelmed by her stuff. She thinks of her childhood bedroom as \u201cvery happy.\u201d But as she grew into adulthood, she kept buying clothing: far too much of it.She went to work in finance, but she found the work empty and meaningless. She would come home and find herself overwhelmed by her stuff. So she began searching for \u201cminimalism\u201d on the internet almost constantly, happening on Pinterest pages of beautiful, empty bathrooms and kitchens, and she began to imagine that it was her stuff that was weighing her down. She read philosophy blogs about materialism and the accumulation of objects. \u201cThey just all talked about feeling lighter,\u201d she said, with one leg folded under her and another on the floor as she sat on her bed, which no longer sparks joy and which she would sell in the coming weeks. Ning wanted that lightness.And here, at this moment in the story, Ning began to cry. \u201cI never knew how to get here from there,\u201d she said. Ning looked around her apartment, which is spare. She loves it here now, but that seemed impossible just a couple of years ago.She found Kondo\u2019s book, and she felt better immediately, just having read it. She began tidying, and immediately she lost three pounds. She had been trying to lose weight forever, and then suddenly, without effort, three pounds, just gone.One day, she was texting a friend, saying that she thought she could live her ideal life if only she could work as Kondo\u2019s assistant. It happened that Kondo was in San Francisco and, even better, she was speaking across the street from Ning\u2019s finance job. After the talk, Ning tried to speak with Kondo, but she walked away with only a KonMari business card from one of Kondo\u2019s associates. She didn\u2019t hear anything initially when she wrote to the address.Undeterred, she quit her job and arranged a trip to Japan. There, she finally talked to associates of Kondo\u2019s who told her of their plans to expand into the United States. Could Ning help? Could she! Ning worked free for KonMari Inc. for five months, before landing a salaried position. She donated the suits that she wore to her finance job and hung up all of her yoga clothing in her closet, even though, technically, KonMari does not endorse hanging leisure wear, but that is all she wears now, and all I\u2019ve seen her wear, from the yoga class we did together to the professional events we attended.Ning has thrown away her collections. She has gone to her family\u2019s home in San Diego and thrown away whatever was left there too. She wiped her tears and leaned in and told me, like a secret, that she has kept one collection: the stickers. She asked me if I wanted to see her album. She pulled it out from under her bed, pages and pages of Snoopy stickers and stickers of frogs and cupcakes and bunnies in raincoats playing in puddles and Easter baskets. She smiled down at them and touched a few while I thumbed through the pages. She asked if I wanted to watch her KonMari her pantry, and I said yes, of course I did. I sat next to her shelf full of books with names like \u201cSecrets of Self-Healing\u201d and \u201cMove Your Stuff, Change Your Life\u201d and \u201cHow to Be Idle\u201d and \u201cThe Art of Serenity.\u201d We threw away expired gum and some Chinese healing herbs whose purpose Ning could no longer remember.I went abroad for a year to Israel after high school. While I was there, the boiler in my house in Brooklyn exploded and a soot fire destroyed all our possessions. \u201cEveryone is O.K., but there was a fire,\u201d my father said when I called. What happened after I got off the phone still confounds me: I returned to my dorm room, and when my roommate asked me how things were at home, I told her they were fine, and we went to sleep. In the middle of the night, I woke my roommate up, telling her that my house burned down. She told me it was a dream, and I kept telling her I had just forgotten to tell her. She didn\u2019t believe me for days.I never saw my sticker album again. I never saw anything again. After the place was cleared out, my mother was able to save a few photo albums, because they were closed when the soot invaded the basement and covered and ruined all the surfaces. When I look at the pictures, I don\u2019t ever notice how young or cute my sisters and I were. I look in the background for the items that lie in the incidental path of my mother\u2019s Canon. I try to remember what they smelled like or why we owned them or where we put them. I try to think of what my life would have been like if I\u2019d returned home to what I left behind, the way my friends were able to return to their homes to what they\u2019d left behind and keep returning, after they finished college and after they got married and after they had kids. I try to think of who I\u2019d be if I weren\u2019t in the habit of looking at my home before I left it each day and mentally preparing myself for the possibility that nothing I owned would be there when I got home that night. I try to know what feelings my lost objects, which I forget more and more as the years pass, would evoke if I could hold them in my hands, KonMari style, like a new kitten. Some would bring joy and some would not, but I\u2019m not someone who thinks that joy is the only valid emotion. I try to remember what I no longer can because, in terms of my possessions, it is as if I was born on my 19th birthday.The reason I bring this up is to tell you that you could not have any stuff at all, much less too much stuff, and still be totally messed up about it. The reason I tell you this is so that you know that that tiny butterfly sticker has been the same burden to me as any hoarder\u2019s yield. Nostalgia is a beast, and that is either a good reason to KonMari your life, or a terrible one, depending on how you want to live.I think the NAPO women have Kondo wrong. She is not one of them, intent on competing for their market share. She is not part of a breed of alpha-organizer \u201csolopreneurs\u201d bent on dominating the world, despite her hashtag. She has more in common with her clients. But when it comes to stuff, we are all the same. Once we\u2019ve divided all the drawers and eliminated that which does not bring us joy and categorized ourselves within an inch of our lives, we\u2019ll find that the person lying beneath all the stuff was still just plain old us. We are all a mess, even when we\u2019re done tidying. At least Kondo knows it. \u201cI was always more comfortable talking to objects than people,\u201d she told me. At that moment, I could tell that if she had her way, I would leave the hotel room and she would spray her spray and be left alone, so she could ask the empty room if she could clean it.An article on July 10 about Marie Kondo, an organizing consultant and writer, misstated the given name of the author of the book \u201cWomen With Attention Deficit Disorder.\u201d She is Sari Solden, not Siri.Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine. She last wrote about the adventure photographer Jimmy Chin and the safety liaison Jamison Walsh\u2019s climb up the spire at 1 World Trade Center.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Night Of,\u2019 John Turturro Picks Up Where James Gandolfini Left Off", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byWhen John Turturro was offered a starring role in the HBO limited series \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d he was torn.For starters, Mr. Turturro, a veteran movie actor, had done relatively little television and was not a huge fan of the form. And when he learned that this role once belonged to James Gandolfini of \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d he said two words to himself: \u201cOh no.\u201d\u201cI was friends with him,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cI went to his wedding. I went to his funeral.\u201dThere was something that made Mr. Turturro uncomfortable about it all. He met Mr. Gandolfini in 1992 through his cousin, the actress Aida Turturro, who later played Tony Soprano\u2019s sister. Mr. Gandolfini starred in Mr. Turturro\u2019s passion project, the 2007 film \u201cRomance & Cigarettes,\u201d which he wrote and directed, and the two vowed to work together again.When Mr. Turturro finally saw the pilot, it was a relief. Mr. Gandolfini was barely in it.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how big a part he had done,\u201d Mr. Turturro said. \u201cSay if he had done, like, the whole thing, I would have been \u2018Ahhh, oh my God, I have to erase that from my memory.\u2019 I had nothing really to erase.\u201dMr. Turturro wrote to Mr. Gandolfini\u2019s widow, and signed on.And this opened the door for something that has happened only occasionally in this celebrated actor\u2019s long career: Mr. Turturro, 59, got a lead role in a high-profile project.\u201cThe Night Of,\u201d an eight-part series that has its premiere on HBO on July 10, centers on the murder of a young Upper West Side woman and a Pakistani-American college student who is charged with the crime. The series explores the intricacies and flaws of New York\u2019s criminal justice system and at times can feel reminiscent of the real-life stories in the first season of the podcast \u201cSerial\u201d or the Netflix documentary \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201d \u201cThe Night Of\u201d was created by Steven Zaillian, who wrote the screenplay for \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d and the author Richard Price.Mr. Turturro plays John Stone, a low-rent lawyer who is trying to keep that student out of jail. What Stone lacks in a big salary or star clients \u2014 he\u2019s a precinct crawler who usually works on small cases involving prostitution or drug offenses \u2014 he makes up for with street smarts. Soon he\u2019s investigating the murder in his spare time.Even after the death of Mr. Gandolfini, \u201cwe all felt \u2018The Night Of\u2019 was very much a project worth pursuing,\u201d said Kary Antholis, the president of HBO\u2019s mini-series unit. \u201cWe had a compelling first episode. The second episode had been written, and it was extremely strong, too. After Jim passed away we grieved, it was a terrible loss. But after a period of time, we consulted with his family and his representatives, and everyone was in agreement that \u2018The Night Of\u2019 ought to go forward.\u201dHBO executives are hopeful that the show will be a hit with critics and viewers and will provide a counterargument to the perception that the network is in a bit of a drama drought.Over a recent lunch at Bar Pitti in the West Village, Mr. Turturro\u2019s trademark Queens accent was on display as he chatted breezily with the wait staff and took a reporter through the menu item by item, translating from Italian. Dressed in a fitted gray T-shirt, he had taken the subway there from his home in Park Slope.For this role, Mr. Turturro took his natural voice and went even bigger: a New York-y accent on steroids.\u201cI knew guys like that from my dad\u2019s generation,\u201d he continued. \u201cSalt of the earth. One of these guys who you\u2019d underestimate.\u201dThe same can be said about Mr. Turturro. He has long been praised for roles as varied as the racist pizza maker in Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and as the paranoid game show whistle-blower in \u201cQuiz Show.\u201d He has appeared in several Coen brothers movies, including one he starred in, \u201cBarton Fink.\u201dDespite dozens of appearances in movies, he has rarely been the signature star in major projects.That mattered little to Mr. Zaillian, a longtime fan of Mr. Turturro\u2019s work. Certain actors, he said, \u201cmay not be the lead, but they\u2019re the ones you remember.\u201d\u201cTake something like \u2018Quiz Show,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI remember him in that more than anybody else. \u2018The Big Lebowski.\u2019 Who can forget that part? \u2018Miller\u2019s Crossing,\u2019 great. Even \u2018Transformers.\u2019\u201dAnd just a decade ago, Mr. Turturro said he was ready to leave acting behind.\u201cYou have a moment in your life where you go, is there anything else I want to do?\u201d he said. \u201cI was telling my doctor about it and said, \u2018I\u2019d like to be a doctor.\u2019 He said: \u2018John, do you know how long you have to go to school to be a doctor? You do good stuff. What you do counts.\u2019\u201dSo Mr. Turturro continues to pursue what he\u2019s done his entire career: work with strong directors and perform in the films and plays he cares about.At times, he has been reluctant to do the sort of things considered a necessary part of show business, like campaigning for awards.\u201cMy agents would yell at me and say, \u2018You got to have a publicist,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018There\u2019s a publicist for the movie. Why do I have to pay a publicist? I\u2019d rather save my money so I can go do an Off Broadway play.\u2019\u201dAnd though he\u2019s done plenty of theater, he hasn\u2019t done much television, despite being \u201coffered a lot.\u201d Mr. Turturro said he never wanted to sign up for the yearslong commitment that TV work used to require.But when he has taken TV on, it\u2019s worked out: He had a limited role in USA\u2019s \u201cMonk\u201d and won an Emmy for best guest actor in a comedy series in 2004.Now, in an era when movie stars frequently appear on TV, especially in limited series, he eagerly joined in. He had worked with Mr. Price\u2019s material before (\u201cClockers\u201d), and Mr. Zaillian had offered him a role in \u201cSearching for Bobby Fischer,\u201d which he wasn\u2019t able to take on.When Mr. Turturro finished reading the scripts for the new series, he watched the pilot with Mr. Gandolfini and saw him sporting a big beard but saying little. (In the slightly retooled episode, Mr. Turturro has a larger role; the rest of the pilot was shot in 2012.)\u201cHe was still James being this human guy, but I don\u2019t know if he figured out what he was going to do,\u201d Mr. Turturro said.As far as being given a role that once belonged to Mr. Gandolfini and Mr. De Niro, he said he was thrilled to be on that shortlist.\u201cThat\u2019s how life is,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many times were people going to do a great part, and another person replaces them?\u201d\u201cAnd that I\u2019m in the conversation?\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m happy about that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Battle of the Network Stars: Trump vs. Clinton", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byIn a year of reboot culture \u2014 \u201cFuller House,\u201d \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we should get a reboot election.Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are unprecedented presumptive nominees: the first woman and the first reality-TV host to lead a major party ticket. But they\u2019re also two people whom America has been watching for what seems like forever.Mr. Trump became a household name in the days of \u201cDynasty,\u201d and his tale has remained a kind of \u201980s prime-time soap of aspiration and ego. Mrs. Clinton became a national figure in 1992, and ever since then her story has been a button-pushing serial about issues of power and gender.Ordinarily, a nominating convention for a nonincumbent is about telling a new story. Not this year. For two weeks beginning July 18, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton will each need to repackage a narrative that\u2019s run longer than \u201cLaw & Order\u201d into a brand-new, four-night mini-series.Mr. Trump will go first. While it\u2019s glib punditry to say that a nominee \u201cneeds to put on a show\u201d at his convention, for him it amounts to proof of concept. He\u2019s treated his showmanship as his chief qualification: Improvising meant he had good instincts; insulting opponents meant he was tough; shouting meant he wasn\u2019t low-energy. In the primary, he cited his TV ratings the way another candidate might boast of balancing a state budget.The catch is that the things that kill at a Trump rally \u2014 stream-of-consciousness, red-meat-hurling, the sense of a heady and barely contained energy \u2014 could be disaster at a Republican National Convention.You want star power and unpredictability? In 2012, the Republicans got Clint Eastwood rambling at an empty chair that he pretended held President Obama. It was an uncomfortable, sad spectacle that seemed to paint the party as cranky old white men yelling at ghosts.His handlers are trying. The Trump campaign has downplayed talk of an \u201cApprentice: Cleveland\u201d-style extravaganza, much as that would answer the prayers of TV critics. And Mr. Trump has already taken to reading speeches off a teleprompter. This must ease his staff\u2019s heartburn, but it neuters him. He becomes a Doberman with a cone around his neck, a steak-lover glumly picking through a salad on his doctor\u2019s orders.It may stick, but it must gnaw at every \u201cIf it feels good, do it\u201d fiber of his improv-artist\u2019s being. If he goes rogue in Cleveland, it would not be the first time his id fired his superego.Mrs. Clinton has a more familiar \u2014 let\u2019s say it, boring \u2014 challenge at her convention: to bring her party together after a divisive primary, to unite its factions against the common enemy.This, in itself, might not be a problem. Putting on a more, well, conventional convention in Philadelphia would be a campaign message in itself: that she\u2019s the reliable choice in a chaotic world. She may not, in four days, dissuade anyone who sees her as beholden to the establishment machine, but at least she could show that she knows how to operate it.But there are complications. First, Mrs. Clinton is running on insider experience in an outsider year, against an opponent who\u2019s seeking the presidency as an entry-level political job. She took the convention stage at Bill Clinton\u2019s nomination back in 1992, to the Fleetwood Mac lyric, \u201cDon\u2019t stop thinking about tomorrow.\u201d It\u2019s going to be hard this time to stop people from thinking of yesterday.And the intervening 24 years has been a national soap opera of scrutiny, scandal and conspiracy theory, criticisms both legitimate and politically motivated, valid and sexist.For someone who was never a media natural to begin with, the experience was formative. If Mr. Trump, the gadfly celebrity, sees media exposure as an opportunity, Mrs. Clinton, the cautious politician, sees it as a risk. Both candidates have fought with the press, but where he treats it as a war of conquest, she treats it as a siege.You see this discomfort in her press appearances, and recent political history is not kind to candidates \u2014 the first President Bush, Al Gore, Mitt Romney \u2014 who are uncomfortable selling themselves.It may help that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s convention is the week after Mr. Trump\u2019s, continuing the point-counterpoint dynamic of the campaign so far. Some of her best media moments have been in adversarial situations, like in her televised marathon testimony last fall to a House committee on Benghazi, where she\u2019s judged more on grit and competence, less on likability.If nothing else, Mr. Trump has given her story a useful Big Bad. It is entirely possible the word \u201cTrump\u201d may be spoken more times at the Democratic convention than at the Republican one.But at some point, a convention has to make an affirmative case for its candidate. That again is where validators come in, and Mrs. Clinton is likely to have more to choose from.But in the end, let\u2019s not kid ourselves: It\u2019s the gold-plated-black-swan candidacy of Mr. Trump that will hang over both convention weeks, like two prime-time series sharing a crossover story line. The Clinton and Trump campaigns, by mutual agreement, recognize he\u2019s this year\u2019s shiny object. The question is whether he\u2019s the dawning sun or an extinction-level-event meteor.This may be for lack of fund-raising and planning. But it also reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s mind-set that this election is about getting buzz, going viral and winning free media \u2014 that he is the ad.Have things really changed? Do targeted media, demographic shifts, data and ground games still matter? Or has the celebrity-media complex upset the paradigm, as in 1960 when Richard Nixon sweated away his chances in a televised debate?Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy to date argues that it has. In programming terms, his campaign is nostalgia-based content \u2014 that thing you used to like, I\u2019m gonna bring it back again! \u2014 married to a 21st-century distribution platform. He\u2019s a classic TV show rebooted for Netflix: that old stuff from back in the day, but edgier and uncensored.The case for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach is that a general election is one of our niche culture\u2019s last mass-audience phenomena. Because of the Electoral College, it\u2019s what television would be like if there were a constitutional requirement that there be only two networks. And more people still watch \u201cNCIS,\u201d even if it\u2019s less exciting.Do the voters want to be riled up or calmed down? Do they crave improv or scripted? The WWE or CBS? Like every presidential election, this one is a choice between parties and policies. But it\u2019s also a contest between two theories of the media and narratives of the culture, between two of the longest-running series in America.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s a 16-Year-Old\u2019s Ticket to Rio.", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byHALMSTAD, Sweden \u2014 Kanak Jha is not sure when he made the change. He thinks it was maybe when he was 9 or 10. He does not remember the precise moment, but he knows it was significant all the same.\u201cI think it was sort of all of a sudden,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI just started doing it. I said, \u2018table tennis\u2019 instead of \u2018Ping-Pong.\u2019\u201dHe paused. \u201cI guess because that\u2019s what I was playing.\u201dThe distinction may seem to be only semantics. But the difference between Ping-Pong (a game largely associated with basements, fraternity houses and rec centers) and table tennis (a sport with more than 200 national associations worldwide) is substantial. If it were not, Jha would not have moved here, about 5,500 miles from his Northern California home, to train five or six hours a day with some of the best coaches in the world in preparation for the Rio Olympics.At 16, Jha is the first American athlete born in the 2000s to qualify for an Olympics, and his hope \u2014 for now at least \u2014 is that his play will increase the recognition of a sport that to many Americans is best known as a decent diversion on a rainy day at summer camp.Spin is the reason he is here.One recent morning, Jha arrived at the Halmstad Arena just after 8:30. Some junior players were already practicing at a few of the 19 tables in the room (sparring, in the vernacular), but Jha went to the opposite end and began a series of physical training exercises designed to stretch and strengthen his legs and enhance his agility and reactions. For nearly an hour, he did not touch his paddle.His trainer, Douglas Jakobsen, is the son of Mikael Andersson, a longtime official in world table tennis who met Jha four years ago at a youth tournament in Austria. Andersson was intrigued by Jha, who had been working with a German coach, Stefan Feth, who also works with the American national team. Andersson developed a relationship with Jha and his family, and was the linchpin in persuading Jha to move to Europe.To Andersson, Sweden, which has a strong table tennis history that includes Jan-Ove Waldner \u2014 viewed by many as the greatest player in history \u2014 was the only place where Jha could properly accelerate his development.\u201cI thought it could really help Kanak to be in a situation like we have here,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cTo be able to train with and play against top players, international players, every day is something he could not have in America. There are great coaches there, but there is nothing like being in a group. You need competition.\u201dJha first visited Halmstad when he was 13. He remembers being awed by the professionalism of the club, one of the most highly regarded in Europe. There was the coaching, sure, led by the former world champion Ulf Carlsson, and the caliber of players was high, too. But the commitment to covering all facets of the sport was what stood out most. Jha had not done much physical training away from the table. At Halmstad, such additional work is viewed as critical.Jha began visiting the club several times a year and arrived last fall to live here full time, and to play for the club in its various leagues and tournaments. Now, he begins most days with Jakobsen, darting over and around discs and ropes on the floor, and springing to scoop up a small soccer ball that Jakobsen drops at random in front of him.All of these drills help Jha react faster during matches and, despite his small and spindly physique, give him a more powerful base from which to rise up and into his shots. His core is what allows him to whip his body and spin the ball, rifling forehands that arc so sharply they resemble a diving paper airplane or slicing backhands so deeply they look to have brakes.\u201cYou need to have a lot of explosiveness, to be able to snap the hips,\u201d Jha said. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t think it, but it\u2019s kind of like the start to a 100-meter dash. You need to be able to fire.\u201dIf that seems difficult to imagine for a game contested over a surface smaller than many dining room tables, one need only watch Jha work. After finishing with Jakobsen, he joined the first-team training session, bouncing side to side and forward and back while sparring with another player, then smacking shots, over and over, during a high-intensity session known as multiball in which a coach quickly patters balls to a player from a basket.During breaks, Jha occasionally chatted with other players \u2014 most of whom were much older \u2014 but largely concentrated on his technique, pantomiming various strokes or going to a side table to hit serves.\u201cKanak is young, but he is very focused,\u201d said Mattias Karlsson, a top player for Halmstad. \u201cSometimes we forget how young he is. He is still learning.\u201dJha readily acknowledges that he is, in many ways, still a kid. He shares a small apartment here with his sister, Prachi, who is also an accomplished player and competed with the Halmstad women\u2019s team (she will return to the United States later this year to begin college). The apartment, which is a short walk from the arena, has a tiny kitchen, twin beds, a secondhand couch and a small bathroom with a door handle that is held up with tape. Jha sits on a low stool when he does his online high school work and spends much of his free time watching table tennis on the internet or surfing Netflix.He misses his family, he said, but he also knows that training in Sweden is an irreplaceable experience. This season, Jha played matches mostly for Halmstad\u2019s second team; next season, he hopes to make more appearances for the first team and continue to develop his international career. On July 8, he defeated his Olympic teammate Yijun Feng, 10-12, 6-11, 12-10, 5-11, 14-12, 11-7, 11-9, to win the men\u2019s singles title at the United States nationals. In doing so, Jha became the youngest men\u2019s national champion since 2009.Qualifying for the Olympics was a similarly dramatic experience. Playing in Canada, against a Canadian, he rallied from 5-0 down in the final set to win, 11-5, and claim his berth. But Jha has measured expectations for Rio: He is ranked 272nd in the world, and he said he would consider his performance a success if he won three matches in the preliminary rounds to reach the main draw of the individual tournament. (He will also compete with the United States in the team competition.)Such a result would be an impressive achievement. But for the moment, Jha is most fixated on continuing to improve his game and demonstrate the consistency that the best players \u2014 some of whom are training alongside him here \u2014 produce against him. He takes affirmations wherever he can find them.During a practice match here this spring, Jha was backed up during a point, chopping back a series of smashes from his opponent. Finally, the opponent hit a shorter shot that angled well off the side of the table and Jha deftly stepped in, swinging his racket on the backhand and sending an off-balance return so loaded with spin that the ball bent around the net \u2014 not over it \u2014 like a crescent before it skimmed off the edge of the table on the opponent\u2019s side.Jha threw up his hands in celebration, proud of his moment of true spinning mastery. His opponent gave a cursory nod of approval. Jha looked around, but there was little recognition from anyone else. The coaches continued prowling. The other players kept pounding their shots, and the click-clack sound of rallies never stopped.Jha stared for a moment, his chest heaving. Then he wiped his forehead, walked up to the table and went back to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Downside to Cord-Cutting", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byTech FixThis year, Michael Gartenberg, a former technology analyst, took the brave step of canceling his cable subscription. After six months of tinkering with alternatives, he went running back.Mr. Gartenberg eventually wondered whether Vue was worth the money he was saving. \u201cAt that point, there had to be better alternatives than this, and it turned out there was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was cable.\u201dYet the overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 about 100 million homes \u2014 still cling to cable.After testing the two for a week, I had an answer: Neither streaming service felt like an adequate substitute for a cable package, largely because of content restrictions, broadcast delays and the difficulty of using a game controller with one of the services.What do Sony\u2019s Vue and Sling TV actually offer? Vue\u2019s starter bundle has more than 55 channels, including ESPN, NBC and Disney, for $30 a month. The higher-tier bundles have 70 channels a month for $35 a month and 100 channels for $45 a month.Sling TV\u2019s base bundle of about 25 channels, which includes ESPN, AMC and CNN, starts at $20 a month. From there, you can add mini bundles, like an extra $5 a month for a group of sports channels, or an additional $5 a month for a children\u2019s bundle including Disney Junior and Nick Toons.Users should be aware that Vue was designed primarily for Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4, which costs about $350. That means the default setup is to use a game controller with the service, though Sony also offers a universal PlayStation 4 remote control that works with Vue for about $30.Sony also offers Vue apps for iPhones, iPads and Android devices, as well as the Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire streaming gadgets.Sling TV works on more devices, including iPhones, iPads and Android devices, plus Apple TV, the Amazon Fire, Roku, Chromecast and the Microsoft Xbox, among others.Another difference is that Vue includes DVR, or the ability to record programs to watch later. You can tag your favorite shows and watch episodes for up to 28 days. Sling TV lacks this ability.For longtime cable subscribers, the limitations on content on Vue and Sling TV may be the toughest to digest. The snags include delays in live broadcasts, the inability to fast-forward through some content, and some missing important channels.With Sling TV, there were long delays when watching live sports. When streaming the Wimbledon tournament, for example, tennis matches were at least 30 seconds behind the live broadcast of the same match on a cable box. This defeats the purpose of watching live sports \u2014 the scores I saw on the screen were behind the scores shown on cable TV or those popping up on Twitter.Sling TV said a number of factors caused broadcast delays, including the internet connection, type of content and channel. By contrast, there was no noticeable delay when watching live sports on Vue.Both services also offer some programs for on-demand viewing, or the ability to watch them whenever you want \u2014 yet for many shows on both services, the services were forbidden to fast-forward through on-demand content. Sony and Sling said the inability to skip through some recorded content was because of agreements with content partners \u2014 in other words, they want you to watch the commercials. The old-school setup of a cable box with TiVo is still more convenient.There are other restrictions, like some major channels missing from both bundles. Sling TV lacks CBS, CW and Discovery, among others. PlayStation Vue also lacks major channels including CW, BBC America and A&E.Another limitation on Vue is that your PlayStation needs to stay put \u2014 meaning if you activated Vue in your house and then took the PlayStation to your family member\u2019s house, you could not log in to Vue. Sony said that network providers designed this restriction to limit TV viewing to your home.Watching TV on a big screen is a group experience, so it\u2019s important to be able to hand the remote control to others to let them channel surf. So I invited my neighbors over and asked them to do something simple with Vue and Sling TV: Find something they wanted to watch. They accomplished the tasks fairly quickly on both services, though they struggled with the PlayStation game controller.One neighbor, who works for a utility company, took about three minutes to figure out how to use the PlayStation controller to load the TV guide and pick something to watch. His wife, a scientist, took about a minute. A third neighbor, a museum worker, fumbled with the controller for about four minutes before finding an episode of \u201cScandal.\u201d They all found the universal remote control, which Sony sells separately, much more intuitive.By contrast, the test subjects all immediately knew how to use Sling TV to pick TV shows or sports events they wanted to watch, using a Roku TV remote, largely because its interface was more streamlined than the Vue\u2019s.It\u2019s tough to recommend either Vue or Sling TV as replacements for a majority of cable subscribers. Technologically, both Vue and Sling TV have better-designed software than a traditional cable box from Comcast, Time Warner or Charter. But because there are some missing major channels and annoying restrictions on how content can be watched, most consumers are better off sticking with cable.Sports fans may enjoy getting access to ESPN and other sports channels on either Vue or Sling TV for less than the cost of a traditional cable subscription. But the broadcast delay on Sling TV is a deal breaker. And if you don\u2019t regularly play video games, buying a PlayStation 4 just for watching sports is costly and impractical. (The Vue apps made for cheaper streaming devices, like Roku and Fire TV, aren\u2019t as powerful as the PlayStation app.)Roger Lynch, the chief executive of Sling TV, said the service gave people the flexibility to subscribe to bundles based on their preferences. \u201cEveryone has their own reasons for becoming a Sling subscriber,\u201d he said in an interview.Eric Lempel, a marketing executive for Sony, said, \u201cWe wanted to give you all the channels that you want,\u201d without the need to pay for hundreds of unnecessary channels.For a small set of cable subscribers, both Vue and Sling TV will have all the channels they want, but they will also include unwanted channels, too.In a perfect world, consumers could pick each channel they want and pay for it, \u00e0 la carte. But the content providers still hold the cards, and there is no easy way to do that quite yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Everyone Can Be \u2018Queer,\u2019 Is Anyone?", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThe speed with which modern society has adapted to accommodate the world\u2019s vast spectrum of gender and sexual identities may be the most important cultural metamorphosis of our time. Facebook, which can be seen as a kind of social census, now offers nearly 60 different gender options, including \u201cquestioning\u201d and \u201cbigender\u201d \u2014 or no gender at all. In a new commercial for Calvin Klein, Young Thug, a slender rapper prone to wearing dresses, states that he feels \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as gender.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recently added Mx, a neutral replacement for titles like Mr. and Mrs. The video game \u201cThe Sims\u201d has even begun allowing players to create same-sex relationships and lifted gender restrictions on characters\u2019 clothing and hairstyles. Plainly, we are in the midst of a profoundly exhilarating revolution. And \u201cqueer\u201d has come to serve as a linguistic catchall for this broadening spectrum of identities, so much so that people who consider themselves straight, but reject heteronormativity, might even call themselves queer. But when everyone can be queer, is anyone?The word became linked to sexual behavior in the early 1900s, as a derogatory term for men deemed effeminate and others who upended traditional gender roles and appearances. As homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and made punishable by law, the word snowballed into a full-blown slur, heard everywhere from the playground (\u201csmear the queer\u201d) to intellectual duels (William F. Buckley Jr. to Gore Vidal: \u201cNow listen, you queer\u201d).This halo of negativity began to dim somewhat in the 1970s, when the word was reclaimed by activists and academics. Not only did its deliberate looseness make it a welcome alternative to the rigidity of \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian,\u201d it also turned the alienating force of the slur into a point of pride. (Though it is still considered offensive by some.) A manifesto distributed at New York City\u2019s Pride parade in 1990 by Queer Nation, a prominent and controversial gay-rights group, put it this way: \u201cWhen a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning, we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we\u2019ve chosen to call ourselves queer. Using \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world.\u201d It was a radical word for a radical time. Protesters and advocacy groups \u2014 particularly communities of color \u2014 took it up to gather support for the fight against the AIDS crisis and for gay rights. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, get used to it\u201d became a popular chant.Academics saw queerness as possessing revolutionary potential. Eve Sedgwick, a professor at Duke who is considered one of the founders of queer theory, described queerness as an \u201copen mesh of possibilities.\u201d David Halperin, a founder of an academic journal on queer studies, describes queerness as a practice, one that is an \u201cexhilarating personal experiment, performed on ourselves by ourselves.\u201d Writing in 1995, Halperin bemoaned the dilution of what he felt was a subversive word. \u201cThere is now a right way to be queer ... to invert the norms of straight society,\u201d he scoffed, referring to clothes, haircuts, piercings, even diets tailored to gay and lesbian buyers. \u201cHow can queer modes of consumption count as resistant cultural practices?\u201d Eight years later, the hit makeover show \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d debuted on Bravo, literalizing Halperin\u2019s concerns. Each episode culminated in a lavish shopping trip that distilled gay culture down to clothes and hair products \u2014 and it was all done in the service of straight men.Increased acceptance of queerness has only led to increased commodification. Every June, the month of most gay-pride celebrations, companies like Netflix, McDonald\u2019s, Apple, Salesforce and Walmart spend tremendous amounts of money to include their branded floats in the parades. This year, Andrew Joliv\u00e9tte, a professor at San Francisco State University, told The Guardian that the city\u2019s event was no longer a symbol of progress. Instead, he said, it felt like a prolonged commercial: \u201cGay Inc.\u201d In the same article, Isa Noyola, a transgender Latina activist in San Francisco, remarked on the paradox that the same companies championing gay rights have contributed to the gentrification that has made the Castro one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic to walk alongside tech companies that have displaced us,\u201d she said.The radical power of \u201cqueer\u201d always came from its inclusivity. But that inclusivity offers a false promise of equality that does not translate to the lived reality of most queer people. Anti-trans bathroom laws and the shooting at Pulse, the gay nightclub in Orlando, are the latest reminders that equality has yet to arrive. Seen this way, such a sunny outlook can, in fact, be counterproductive. DarkMatter, a South Asian trans performance-art duo, highlights this observation \u2014 the way visibility and acceptance can actually lead to erasure \u2014 in their works. In one, called \u201cRainbows Are Just Refracted White Light,\u201d they intone, \u201cRainbows are just a trick of light, they make us forget the storm is still happening.\u201dMaybe we are relying on a single word, a single idea, a single identity, to do too much. After all, \u201cqueer\u201d never belonged to us; it was foisted upon us, and we reconfigured it to make it ours. The future will bring new possibilities and ideas \u2014 and new terms for them. Scientists are still learning about the vast and complex components that interact to create human sexuality. An article in Nature from 2015 delved into the latest research on sex and gender among mice. Sex determination is thought to happen in the womb, but studies of mice suggest that sex can fluctuate between male and female throughout life. Someday, maybe we\u2019ll recognize that queer is actually the norm, and the notion of static sexual identities will be seen as austere and reductive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin Durant Reboots, Goes Digital", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byNotebookThere was a technical glitch. The Golden State Warriors, breakers of unbreakable records, failed to finish the season as repeat N.B.A. champions. Silicon Valley\u2019s hometown team lost to some guys from the Rust Belt. So this week the Warriors upgraded their operating system. An already-extraordinary lineup that included the league\u2019s two-time reigning M.V.P., Steph Curry, added the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Kevin Durant, the best scorer of his generation and the last M.V.P. before Curry.One study has found that the average American checks his or her phone 46 times a day. (Am I sick to admit that sounds kind of low?) There is a kind of paradox in the fact that much of what fuels those dozens of visits is content siphoned from the old citadels, New York and Hollywood. But no one reaches for Hollywood 46 times a day. Considered in that light, Durant joining the Warriors is the latest piece of evidence, if another were needed, that the cultural center of gravity has shifted from Los Angeles to Silicon Valley.All those celebrities sitting courtside at Lakers games (assuming they still go to Lakers games) \u2014 their influence has withered when set beside the rise of Netflix, Apple, Facebook and others. The video-game industry alone rivals the Hollywood box office. A different set of people, some 380 miles north of the Staples Center, now have their hands on the cultural levers. And they have the basketball team to prove it.Incredibly, Los Angeles hoped that Durant would spurn his other suitors and choose the Lakers. Once upon a time, that choice may have been tempting \u2014 the glamour, the celebrity, the movie deals. Durant didn\u2019t even take a meeting with the Lakers. (Though he did meet with the Los Angeles Clippers, the city\u2019s perpetual step-child. It went nowhere.)A snubbing like that would have been inconceivable not long ago, when the Lakers reigned: five championships in the 1980s, another five in the 2000s. You could see the city\u2019s swagger in the reflections from Jack Nicholson\u2019s sunglasses, Pat Riley\u2019s shiny slicked-back hair, Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s glistening pate.That was by design. Jerry West, a Hall of Famer who spent 40 years with the Lakers, recently published a memoir in which he recounts Jerry Buss\u2019s vision for the team, which Buss bought in 1979. \u201cJerry wasn\u2019t buying a basketball team,\u201d West writes. \u201cHe was buying the Lakers as a form of high-level entertainment, Hollywood style, including scantily clad girls.\u201dThe Lakers are no longer entertaining, haven\u2019t been in years. In the age of big data and performance-metrics analytics, the notion of sports as show business feels as dated as Busby Berkeley. Sports have become mathematics. Sports have become tech.West devoted virtually his entire life to the Lakers, first as a point guard, then as an executive. He was a Los Angeles icon through several Hollywood golden ages, a man so revered that his statue stands outside the Lakers\u2019 stadium. (As Buss put it at the dedication, \u201cHow many people ever get a statue?\u201d) Is it a coincidence that three months after the statue\u2019s unveiling, West agreed to join, of all teams, the Warriors? This is the team he now serves as a kind of spiritual adviser, bringing an aura of gravitas and success to the organization. Tech companies like to associate with graybeards in this way. And like so much else in Silicon Valley, the connection works. By several accounts, it was West\u2019s personal phone call to Durant that helped seal the deal.In his memoir, West doesn\u2019t say much about what drew him to Silicon Valley. His relationship with Lakers management had fractured. The Warriors\u2019 new tech luminaries, the owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, had an \u201centhusiasm for what they were hoping to achieve [that] was contagious.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to call Durant\u2019s move part of our long national migration west, dating back to the Gold Rush. (Through that lens, it\u2019s fitting that the team is named not after an actual city but a honeyed oasis called \u201cGolden State.\u201d) After all, where was the miserable address Tom Joad left behind? Oklahoma, same as Durant.But Durant\u2019s move to the Warriors brings a digital sheen to the story. He announced his decision in a letter posted to a relatively new site called The Players\u2019 Tribune, where his title is \u201cdeputy publisher.\u201d The site was created to bypass traditional gatekeepers, like The New York Times, by giving athletes a platform that does not require interacting with journalists. It implies nothing sinister to point out that The Players\u2019 Tribune has received millions in funding from New Enterprise Associates, one of the biggest venture firms in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s simply how the world works today.When I was growing up, my dad used to root against the Lakers because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see all those people in Los Angeles happy.\u201d Plenty of others felt the same way: \u201cBeat L.A.\u201d became a national chant. That distaste wasn\u2019t entirely, or even mostly, about the basketball team. It was about Los Angeles as a cultural Goliath. The place represented the unreality of American myth-making, embodied our love-hate relationship with Hollywood, schlock and all, and its dominance of pop culture. That power also made it an symbol of the rich always getting richer.Our new love-hate relationship is with our phones, those gorgeous little tyrants. If you listen closely, you can hear a new chant bubbling up across the country, an almost populist protest aimed at our new overlords.\u201cBeat Golden State!

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Day 4", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementCLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump has said and done many offensive things during his presidential campaign, but the greatest insult was his overarching motive. With every boast about his poll numbers, every celebration of his victory margins and every sorting of the world into winners like him and losers like just about everybody else, he seemed to be on something other than a political quest or civic mission. It was pure ego trip. I suspect it still is. But what was most striking about his remarks on the final night of the Republican National Convention was the way in which they sought to refute that very notion. They were much, much, much too long, as if he were trying to prove his worthiness for the presidency with sheer oratorical stamina. They rambled. But they recognized that perhaps the tallest obstacle between him and the White House isn\u2019t his lack of experience or even his recklessness but his epic and all-too-obvious narcissism. When Americans go to the polls, it\u2019s not the final episode of the kind of reality show that he once starred in, nor is it the final minutes of the kind of beauty pageant that he once owned. They\u2019re not bestowing a crown. They\u2019re electing a leader, someone who can ideally soothe their anxieties and improve their lives. Is Trump finally and fully getting that? His speech suggested so. It wasn\u2019t an adolescent frenzy of self-congratulation like last Saturday\u2019s unhinged introduction of Mike Pence as his running mate. In its straightforward, unadorned sentences, \u201cI\u201d ceded plenty of space to \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cwe.\u201d It even went so far as to turn the tables, casting Hillary Clinton as the candidate on a gilded path of self-aggrandizement. \u201cMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt reads: \u2018I\u2019m With Her.\u2019 I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \u2018I\u2019m with you, the American people.\u2019 I am your voice.\u201d \u201cI am with you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI will fight for you. And I will win for you.\u201d Winning was still his obsession, but it was framed as an act of altruism. Thus the inveterate braggart became the humble servant, or at least tried to restyle himself that way. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see if the makeover takes and a man who lost control of Cleveland can gain control of himself. The fiercest blast of energy came from Ted Cruz\u2019s flamboyant snub of Trump. And the second biggest story was the plagiarism in Melania Trump\u2019s tribute to her husband. Day after day, disruptions and distractions eclipsed whatever the message was supposed to be. \u201cThe people\u2019s champion,\u201d said his daughter Ivanka Trump, who introduced him \u2014 and who assured Americans that they don\u2019t really understand him. She vouched for him as \u201ccolorblind and gender-neutral\u201d and said that what he taught her and her siblings was that they \u201ceach had a responsibility to work not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world.\u201d Much of Trump\u2019s speech was familiar and expected, underscoring a Nixonian strategy to win the White House by stoking Americans\u2019 fears. He painted an almost unbearably dark portrait of a country reeling from lawlessness \u2014 he emphasized illegal immigration in particular \u2014 and a world stalked by terrorists. He placed some of the blame for that jihadist terror at his Democratic opponent\u2019s feet. \u201cThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be America\u2019s legacy.\u201d He invoked her emails and excoriated her ethics. But in other ways, his speech was a departure, for the convention as well as for him. Although prior nights focused on reassuring staunch conservatives that they could trust Trump, he in a few passages sought to reassure other Americans that he stood for them as well. He remembered the \u201c49 wonderful Americans\u201d who were shot dead in a gay nightclub in Orlando and pledged to protect the \u201cL.G.B.T.Q. community,\u201d laboring over the politically correct cluster of consonants. When the delegates in the convention hall applauded that, he digressed from his prepared remarks to acknowledge it. \u201cI have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said,\u201d Trump told them. This was less a general-election pivot than a general-election lunge. But his most remarkable course correction was away from a perverse fixation on the glory of Donald Trump. At the beginning of the speech, when he did indulge one of his customary brags about his vote count in the Republican primaries, he shared the credit, referring to what \u201cwe\u201d accomplished, meaning him and his supporters, and putting asterisks around that pronoun. \u201cI say \u2018we\u2019 because we are a team,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cEvery day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.\u201d \u201cThese are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI am your voice.\u201d Trump may be a master salesman, but can he really sell that? Trump, whose buildings are billboards on which he can write his name in big, gold letters? Trump, whose entrepreneurial energy has gone into luxe resorts with luxe golf courses? Trump, who has profited from so many ventures that left others diminished? I\u2019m doubtful. But I\u2019m impressed that someone who used a debate to assure us of his prodigious manhood kept his vanity so zipped. Ivanka Trump glided onstage to the Beatles\u2019 \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d It was apt. She was sun-kissed, her blond hair perfectly sleek, blowing photogenically, no doubt from a fan in the podium. The fashion entrepreneur\u2019s blush-pink sheath and stilettos looked Fifth Avenue chic. The 34-year-old ornament to the Trump brand was like a beautiful sunny morning in the midst of a dark, lashing hailstorm. She was glossy, both in how she looked and how she spoke. She glossed over all of her father\u2019s ugly rhetoric and incitements, his erratic behavior and lack of any policy depth or even any policy, and offered a gauzy, idealized vision of a Bobby Kennedy-style figure as her father channeled Richard Nixon in \u201968. She hailed her dad as a fighter against injustice, a boss who is \u201ccolorblind and gender neutral,\u201d who hires people of all ethnicities and backgrounds. She glossed over the entire ideology of the G.O.P. and the regressive party platform for women and presented her father as a feminist who fights for women in the Trump organization and who would fight as president for child care, \u201caffordable and accessible for all,\u201d and for women\u2019s rights, equal pay and maternity leave. \u201cI will fight for this, too, right alongside him,\u201d she said, serving, once more, as the classy conjurer of the Moderate, Sane Donald in place of the Dark, Ugly Donald. One impediment to joy, as Ivanka tried to channel Hillary: The Boston Globe\u2019s Matt Viser reported last month that men in the Trump campaign earn about 35 percent more than the women in his campaign. Trump would never make the eat-your-peas pivot to professionalism, comity and civility, so Ivanka did it for him. She called her father \u201cthe people\u2019s champion\u201d and \u201cthe people\u2019s nominee,\u201d making him sound like Princess Diana, the people\u2019s princess. She offered sweet anecdotes to personalize her father, but she was so sunny that her portrait of him was almost unrecognizable. More like a jolly Santa than a short-fingered vulgarian. She said she remembered him, when she was a child playing with Legos in the corner of his skyscraper office, tearing stories out of the newspaper about someone facing some injustice or hardship and writing a note in his black felt-tip pen to find the person and have them brought to Trump Tower, where he could get in their corner when they were down and give them a job or a break until they could feel that life is great again. She said her father had \u201cempathy and generosity,\u201d and threw in \u201ckindness and compassion\u201d for good measure. Hopes are often reposed in family members. Everyone hoped that Barbara Bush was secretly working to make H.W. Bush more liberal on choice issues. Everyone hoped that Laura Bush was secretly working on W. to get Donald Rumsfeld fired. But Ivanka Trump has a stupefyingly harder task. Everyone is hoping that with her calm and gracious air, she is secretly working to turn Donald Trump into a completely different being, to make him stop acting self-destructive and crazy and nasty. She offers herself as that bright promise. But, as much as she might try to steer her willful father, we know that it is not really possible to curb his impulsiveness and narcissism or to moderate and modernize his positions. He is too in thrall to the roar of the crowd, too old to develop impulse control. So it just turns her into a fabulous fabulist. She said her father advised her when she was growing up: \u201cIvanka, if you\u2019re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\u201d And what can be bigger thinking than making the most divisive, disliked candidate in modern history seem like noble Atticus Finch \u2014 though it would be hard to imagine Atticus saying, as Donald Trump once did of his own daughter, that he would like to date a full-grown Scout if she weren\u2019t, in fact, his daughter. She said he taught his kids to have a moral compass \u2013 with a straight face. Ivanka has, at times, played the charming sidekick to Trump in his more unsavory business dealings. In 2006, she helped sell spots in a future Baja California condo complex that bore the Trump name. While the Trump organization earned $500,000 for their branding and sales efforts, all the people convinced by her and her father\u2019s promises lost their money when the outside developer failed to build anything. She denied any fault, telling CBS News that her family had \u201clived up to our obligation under a license agreement.\u201d The 2016 Republican platform condemns the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which granted same-sex couples the freedom to marry. It also states that \u201ctraditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society.\u201d But Mr. Brookman said he\u2019d heard a different message from speakers the previous night who talked about the G.O.P. as \u201ca big-tent party.\u201d Elsewhere on the floor, Barbara Paulus, a delegate from Kansas, said her ideal party platform would not mention L.G.B.T. issues, except to say \u201cthat everyone has the same rights as an American.\u201d For Lisenne Dudderar, a delegate from Arkansas, the perfect platform would say nothing on the topic. Later in the evening, the crowd applauded when the venture capitalist Peter Thiel said he was \u201cproud to be gay.\u201d Mr. Brookman, a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, had found convention delegates, including those from conservative states, receptive to his message. He was hopeful that an inclusive spirit would prevail under a Donald Trump presidency. Mr. Trump \u201cis historically very supportive of L.G.B.T. rights,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care as long as you perform.\u201d Mr. Brookman wasn\u2019t always on Team Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t start there but I\u2019m actually very, very excited to end there.\u201d What gives Mr. Thiel such confidence in Mr. Trump? He said he likes Mr. Trump because \u201che is a builder and it\u2019s time to rebuild America,\u201d that he wanted to end \u201cstupid wars.\u201d And he said Mr. Trump understands that fake culture wars are a distraction. He followed that up by saying he was a proud Republican and a proud American, to cheers from the crowd and chants of USA USA USA. Ted Cruz really is Canadian. Because if he were a true Texan, he would know, yes, when to hold \u2019em and when to fold \u2019em. We happened upon the El Paso branch of the Texas delegation at the Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse. The delegates, wearing matching white cowboy hats and red, white and blue shirts with a lone star, were still fit to be tied at Cruz\u2019s withholding convention speech and truculent meeting with them this morning. It was a case of Andrew Marvell irritation: Had we but world enough and time, this coyness, sir, were no crime. Cruz thought his coy, smart-alecky refusal to endorse or even boost Donald Trump in his prime-time speech was a springboard to 2020. Instead, he\u2019s riding a bronco called Trump. If he had wanted to stand on principle and not play patty-cake with Trump like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, many here felt, Cruz should have stayed home. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone commit hara-kiri on national television,\u201d said Mark Dunham. \u201cMr. Cruz, whether he realizes it or not, he turned himself into Omarosa. It was political suicide. I cannot rationalize his thought process other than he\u2019s taking it way too personally and making it more about himself than God and country.\u201d Adolpho Telles, the owner of Rosa\u2019s Cantina in El Paso, agreed: \u201cI am so annoyed with him. He should have accepted what occurred and moved on with his life. You\u2019ve got to support your candidate 100 percent.\u201d The bright side, he said, was that the anger at Cruz had brought the delegates together and distracted them from the worries some have that they are not yet totally in love with their erratic, dictatorial Gotham mogul. Telles was not buying Cruz\u2019s defense this morning to them that he was not \u201ca servile puppy dog\u201d who would tell Trump \u201cthank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\u201d Telles said he was thinking: \u201cThis is not about you or your wife. It\u2019s about Trump. And it\u2019s about America.\u201d An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a member of Donald Trump\u2019s staff. She is Omarosa Manigault, not Amarosa.\nLauren Tamaki is live-illustrating the speech, with your input.\n\u201cThe font is good for you, Dad?\u201d Ms. Trump asked. \u201cFor me it would be great to have it a tiny bit bigger.\u201d \u201cThen you get fewer words,\u201d replied Mr. Trump. The font was left as is. Mr. Trump then read aloud the words on the glass: \u201cFour score and seven years ago \u2026\u201d Presumably he was reading teleprompter dummy copy. Unless he plans to inflict an Abe impersonation on what\u2019s left of the party of Lincoln. CBS News captured this candid video of the Trumps discussing the legibility of the electronic cue cards. And then @CBSNews spun the video as something of a gotcha on Twitter. \u201cWatch as @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump tweak the teleprompter at the #RNCinCLE.\u201d But it\u2019s surprising that this mild video by CBS News could even pass as a Twitter gotcha. The companionable exchange among the engineers and the Trumps is far too benign to qualify for the usual Twitter scrum. But the CBS News video is about as spiky as media coverage has gotten this week, in spite of predictions that the convention coverage would be vertigo. But the convention has also failed to explode in another way. In spite of nervousness over how to cover a fractious convention and anticipated protests, the television networks ended up fitting this year\u2019s unconventional convention into their decades\u2019 old template for event coverage. When dissent among Republican delegates was put down on Day 1, the networks did not themselves dissent or send cameras to follow the disaffected parties out of the room. Instead, they largely put the disruption behind them, and continued to cover Mr. Trump as if there were party consensus about his nomination. Yesterday, Mr. Trump underscored the point suggested by the media\u2019s camerawork: \u201cOther than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is very united. Great love in the arena!\u201d All week off-camera Mr. Trump has been playing media critic, as usual, on Twitter. He tweeted regular praise of Fox News and denigrated CNN and others for biased coverage and low ratings. Mr. Trump\u2019s posts suggest that he never takes his eye off the media, and that he\u2019s prepared, whatever else he\u2019s up to, to smack the wayward ones whenever they get out of line. Is it possible that, just as the mainstream media seems to have tamed social media for now, the Trump campaign has managed to subdue the mainstream media? No doubt Cruz believes that it will help him \u2014 that the party\u2019s many anti-Trumpers will remember his refusal to abase himself, and that enough Trump voters will forgive him if he runs on populist and anti-establishment themes. But there are good reasons to think otherwise, starting with the fact that Cruz couldn\u2019t win this year\u2019s nomination even though he ended up the last man standing against a candidate the party had every reason to reject. If his \u201cvote your conscience\u201d speech cements his standing with many conservatives and wins him strange new respect from anti-Trump moderates, it\u2019s also turned his radio-talker supporters against him and added to his lengthy list of party enemies \u2014 which means that in future presidential cycles it might put a harder ceiling on his support. And throughout Trump\u2019s rise, far too many Republican politicians have gotten lost in this mostly-futile gaming-out of options. From Paul Ryan\u2019s temporizing \u2014 criticize but don\u2019t oppose, withhold your endorsement and then offer it reluctantly \u2014 to Marco Rubio\u2019s #NeverTrump, no, wait, #NeverHillary lurches, there\u2019s been a futile quest for some perfect political balance that keeps every option open and every faction happy, that distances you from Trump in one breath while normalizing with him with the other. That\u2019s what Cruz earned himself last night: not a better chance at the presidency, but a profile in political courage that will be remembered no matter what happens to his political ambitions henceforth. And it\u2019s yet another irony of this most ironic year that it would be the most overtly Machiavellian of Republican politicians who would keep his honor, and pass a test that so many politicians of more conspicuous high-mindedness have failed. Much has been said about Donald Trump\u2019s reputation as a connoisseur of women \u2014 mostly by him. So it is interesting to see which women \u2014 besides the glossy Bond girls in his family \u2014 are stepping up to the podium to give testimonials to the Beauty of Trump. Ordinarily at a Republican convention, you get a lot of pasty-faced white guys droning on about policies that would yank rights away from women. But G.O.P. officials jammed all the Teanderthal \u201cMad Men\u201d stuff in the platform a week ago. The Trump convention is a blithely policy-free zone, \u201cthe ultimate reality show,\u201d as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, called it. Some Washington think tanks even canceled their usual policy seminars. What was the point? In the absence of the usual suspects \u2014 G.O.P. stars and a few A-list celebrities from movies where things get blown up \u2014 a selection of random women have stepped into the void. Convention planners are hoping there has to be another way besides Ivanka to improve Trump\u2019s abysmal favorability numbers with women and to provide some counterprogramming to the harsh calls for execution or imprisonment, or both, of the first woman to head a major party ticket. But delegates sometimes looked a little mystified by the parade of obscure women, some of whom offered no explanation of how or even if they knew Trump. Somehow, in this unorthodox gathering, an avocado farmer and former soap opera actress who won two awards from Soap Opera Digest for being Outstanding Villainess ended up in prime time, standing before a screen the exact color of guacamole in a Trump Tower taco bowl. \u201cMany of you know me from one of your favorite soap operas \u2018The Young and the Restless\u2019 and \u2018The Bold and the Beautiful,\u2019\u201d Kimberlin Brown said, adding that since she had only One Life to Live, she pursued other dreams. Kerry Woolard, the general manager of the Trump Winery, made Trump\u2019s turnaround of the Virginia vineyard sound like Eisenhower at Omaha Beach: \u201cQuickly and decisively,\u201d she said, he went \u201cto work replanting the vines.\u201d We also enjoyed the stylings of Michelle Van Etten, a statuesque blonde with a disjointed speaking style and karate-chop hand motion that seemed to alarm some delegates. Balancing out Trump, called the \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d by Spy magazine, Von Etten has unusually long fingers. She told the traumatic saga of going to her 20th high school reunion. She saw that her former classmates were driving BMWs and \u201clooked like Barbie,\u201d while she was 30 pounds overweight and driving a minivan. \u201cI began to dream again,\u201d she said, adding that she started a fashion business in Florida and \u201cafter two years, I was able to retire my husband\u201d and he was able to home-school their kids. Natalie Gulbis, the 441st best female golfer in the world who was in the second season of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d told the story of how she hit the links once with Trump and he helped her realize her dream of opening a Boys and Girls Club. \u201cThese words previously fell on deaf albeit well-intentioned ears, but that day was different,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cThey finally fell on ears that cared enough to take action.\u201d Trump\u2019s caring ears must have burning. Donald Trump 1) Seems to be a very affectionate father. 2) Did a good job rebuilding that skating rink in Central Park back in the 1980s. 3) Have I mentioned the children? O.K., sorry. He\u2019s a much more pleasant person in private than he seems in public. Hillary Clinton 1) Despite her fame, eagerly spends much of her time interacting with average people under less than glamorous conditions. 2) Had a better health care plan than Barack Obama in 2008. 3) Never folds under pressure. What on earth is BitTorrent News? At this point, it\u2019s no surprise when an organization experiments with ways to use technology to advance the distribution of news. The New York Times is one of many doing so. BitTorrent \u2014 a company based, of course, in San Francisco \u2014 is using news to advance technology. Until fairly recently, BitTorrent didn\u2019t have a news site. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really a website at all. It\u2019s a \u201cprotocol\u201d \u2014 a bunch of software used to transfer files across the internet. BitTorrent\u2019s technology, now about 12 years old, was a success among companies that distribute large amounts of data to large numbers of people at the same time, like Facebook or the online gaming company Blizzard. More notoriously, pirate websites use the technology to offer illegal downloads. Erik Schwartz, a vice president for the company, was quick to say that his company does not offer those services, but its software is open source. After a while, BitTorrent started to focus on video streaming, which is how Netflix delivers movies and TV shows to your computer, and found the available technology lacking. \u201cDuring the 2014 World Cup, we\u2019d be watching ESPN online and Twitter would explode with \u2018GOAL!\u2019 and then you\u2019d watch little guys running around on a soccer field for four minutes until you saw the goal being scored,\u201d Schwartz said. While the future of scripted video programming like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d lies in the kind of on-demand streaming that Netflix offers, sports and news have bigger audiences and have to be offered live. So BitTorrent looked for a live event to test their technology, and along came the 2016 New Hampshire primary. BitTorrent rented some space in the Radisson Hotel in Manchester, N.H., and BitTorrent News was born. The company hired a news director and some young people with video and journalistic experience. Now it has a mini-studio here in Cleveland, next to The Times\u2019s work space, with an on-camera staff and people behind the scenes, like Benjamin Ratner, 24, who said he edited his first video in seventh grade. BitTorrent has bigger ambitions, which do not seem to include Emmy Awards or Pulitzer Prizes. In May, it started a multichannel TV-like application, which is free, for now. In the future, it hopes to provide an alternative to broadcast and cable networks for things like football games or the World Cup. Meanwhile, the BitTorrent team is having fun covering political conventions. I\u2019m a veteran reality-TV producer. In my field, character is everything, and shows work best with a diversity of recognizable character types: the everyman, the alpha female, the clown, the wizard, the villain. Mr. Trump has always played an antihero in the mold of Simon Cowell on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d: a character with flaws, but someone we tune in to see. Reality-TV villains differ from villains in other narrative forms in that they don\u2019t necessarily have a unique agenda \u2014 they don\u2019t want to kill James Bond or destroy Gotham. They want what all the other characters want: to win the competition, to remain on the island, to receive a rose, to be president. What sets them apart are six simple words: \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends.\u201d This could very well be Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign motto. Likewise, Mr. Trump won the Republican primary competition, his strategic alliance with Chris Christie paying dividends against a threatening Marco Rubio. The convention, however, is exposing the vast difference between the reality-TV star and the man who must lead his party and, perhaps, this country. For Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, the experience in Cleveland must be extremely disappointing. Mr. Trump promised a dazzling showbiz convention packed with A-listers from the sports and entertainment world. For an audience raised on the production values of shows like \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the convention, plagued with a glitchy Jumbotron and cringe-worthy Republican dancing in a half-empty arena, has a state-fair vibe. And while Mr. Trump has been immersed in the alternate universe of reality-TV stardom for years, surely he cannot consider the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Willie Robertson, the golfer turned apprentice Natalie Gulbis, or the \u201980s trivia answer Scott Baio to be A-list. On most reality shows, a savvy producer can steer cast members back on track. The Trump show has one fatal flaw: Mr. Trump is producing it himself. And reality-TV villains, by their very nature, are bad at uniting a cast. If the Master Negotiator couldn\u2019t negotiate an endorsement from Ted Cruz, how will he negotiate his promised concessions from America\u2019s allies and enemies? Mr. Trump may yet turn the convention around. He\u2019ll need a good surprise. Something fun and unexpected, like Arnold Schwarzenegger descending a zip-line to introduce him, or Sarah Palin snowmobiling in to save the day. In his big speech, he could humanize himself by opening up about vulnerabilities that he\u2019s heretofore avoided \u2014 the death of his alcoholic brother, his struggles with bankruptcy \u2014 or maybe even his lifelong fight to overcome narcissistic personality disorder. But that\u2019s not Mr. Trump\u2019s character. If nothing else, this convention has given undecided voters a preview of a Trump presidency: divisive, ineffective and designed mainly for ratings. As for Hillary Clinton, her weakness is politics and a penchant for secrecy and self-inflicted injuries, and her strength is policy \u2014 she\u2019s smart as a whip and has a real passion that goes back decades for disadvantaged children, who constitute the single most neglected constituency in America today. Sit down with Clinton, and on this topic she\u2019s a policy wonk able to talk in detail about policies that would help, including home visitation and pre-k. She understands that the key to addressing poverty is to help young children. She also cares deeply about addressing gender inequities around the world \u2014 human trafficking, child marriage, girls pulled out of school \u2014 which to me constitute some of the world\u2019s great injustices. Moreover, although Republicans today despise Clinton and are debating whether it\u2019s best to jail her or shoot her, Clinton had a good record in the Senate and at the State Department of working with Republicans to get things done. For me, the hope of a Hillary Clinton administration is that we might actually make progress in addressing some of the greatest inequities at home and abroad. Holy Cuyahoga, Republicans! \u201cWe don\u2019t just put on red jerseys and blue jerseys,\u201d he told the delegates. \u201cThis is about principles and ideals.\u201d He added that he\u2019s not \u201ca servile puppy dog.\u201d The Texans were yelling. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get over it,\u201d said one. \u201cThis is politics.\u201d \u201cNo, this is not politics,\u201d Mr. Cruz fired back. Maybe he\u2019s got a point \u2014 this is the battle of the Constitutional Conservative vs. the Network TV Star. Don\u2019t go to Essos because you could become a love slave to a Dothraki prince. And stay away from Westeros because Cersei is about to get into some carnage that will make the Republican chaos look like child\u2019s play, and don\u2019t forget winter is here with the Whitewalkers. On an amusing side note, I asked D.B. Weiss, one of the cool creators of the show, whether Trump reminded him of any GOT character. \u201cHodor,\u201d he replied. Ms. Winfrey \u201conce famously asked my father if he envisioned running for the presidency of the United States,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said. \u201cHis answer? \u2018Only if it got so bad that I had no choice.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat day has come.\u201d In that 1988 interview, Donald Trump told Ms. Winfrey he probably wouldn\u2019t run for president. But, he said, \u201cIf it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what\u2019s happening with this country.\u201d The Winfrey interview is now part of Trump lore, serving as evidence that Mr. Trump never sought high office, but is now ready to renounce his business career in service of the people. \u201cTo whom much is given, much will be required,\u201d Eric Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the very belief that compelled my father to make this great sacrifice, to run for the most powerful yet unforgiving office in the world.\u201d Actually, it seems Donald Trump has been willing to make this great sacrifice for some time \u2014 it\u2019s just that this year, he might actually get the chance. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness,\u201d Gov. Pence went on. \u201cHe\u2019s his own man.\u201d Speakers all night had been coyly invoking Mr. Trump\u2019s aggro provocations \u2014 and trying manfully to reframe them. Mr. Pence had begun to practice this art earlier in the week on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d when he used a Trump family default description: \u201cTrump speaks from the heart.\u201d For months, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have been leaning hard on those words to turn his vengefulness and vigilantism into a virtue. Earlier in the day, in an interview with CNN, Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka had protested that her father is neither sexist nor racist. Instead, she said, \u201cHe is authentic.\u201d She went on: \u201cHe\u2019s bold. He\u2019s unabashed.\u201d Showing amused tolerance of bigotry as a foible of a colorful, charismatic, impolite, rough, direct, brutally honest, authentic, bold and unabashed \u2014 but ultimately endearing \u2014 old so-and-so seemed contrived when Mr. Obama tried it. And it seems contrived now. But the sincerity excuse persists. \u201cI speak from here\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump said in June, pointing to his head \u2014 \u201dand from the heart.\u201d On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Pence to discuss their partnership. The go-to phrase surfaced when Mr. Pence was asked why he had once objected to Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on foreign Muslims. After fumbling for a bit, Mr. Pence explained that Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t speak like a politician.\u201d Then, as if cued like one of the hypnotized in \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cHe speaks from the heart.\u201d Casting Mr. Trump\u2019s incitements to xenophobia and violence as heartfelt evidently makes them slightly less terrifying. A through-line of the convention has been to set up a powerful antagonism between \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d the province of the hypocritical, intellectual and weak-willed, and \u201cspeaking from the heart,\u201d as a province of \u2026 Donald Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s children, maybe because they\u2019re naturals to liken him to Mr. Obama\u2019s benign \u201cold uncle,\u201d have especially seized on the power of \u201cfrom the heart\u201d to extenuate almost anything. Revving up to give his speech at the convention tonight, Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric turned the phrase on himself. The speech \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t something I was going to outsource,\u201d he said, perhaps inadvertently slighting other Trumps \u2014 Donald Jr., Melania \u2014 who notably used speechwriters for their own addresses. He concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s just too important to me. I\u2019m going to speak from the heart tonight.\u201d The phrase sounds smarmy. It compromises the Republican Party\u2019s usual claim of hardheadedness over and against the bleeding-heart emotionalism of the other party. But it\u2019s probably the only possible rhetorical move of the Trump campaign. It\u2019s become impossible for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters to lend reason or logic to his vendettas, daft misogyny, thoroughgoing racism and bloodlust. Instead, they advertise it as lovable. \nThe Times columnists discuss Ted Cruz, the developments in Cleveland and answer questions from readers.\nScreaming matches between delegates. Past nominees who refused to attend. Speakers who seem allergic to mentioning the nominee\u2019s name \u2013 or policies. The runner-up refusing to endorse the winner. Plagiarism. Lies about plagiarism. Talk of Lucifer from the stage. Humanizing stories about the nominee relegated to obscure time slots. Multiple speakers calling for the jailing of the opposing nominee. A prominent delegate calling for that nominee\u2019s execution by firing squad. It\u2019s time to ask where the Republican National Convention of 2016 ranks on the list of modern history\u2019s worst political conventions. By worst, I\u2019m not making a moral judgment, though that wouldn\u2019t be kind, either. I\u2019m talking instead about effectiveness \u2013 judging the conventions as a dispassionate political professional would. Relative to many of this year\u2019s speeches, though, Mr. Buchanan\u2019s looks mild. And the full Houston convention was more successful than many people recall. Mr. Bush rose 6 points in the polls afterward, according to the political scientists Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. It\u2019s hard to put on a convention that doesn\u2019t create a polling bounce. A second entry on the list is more recent: the Republicans, in Tampa, four years ago. A hurricane cut it short by a day. Clint Eastwood had a bizarre conversation with an empty chair. And Mitt Romney received no noticeable bump in the polls. But I think the two worst conventions to date were both Democratic ones \u2013 in the topsy-turvy years of 1968 and 1972. The Democrats, like the rest of the country, were riven by the Vietnam War in 1968, and a sense of conflict and violence dominated the Chicago gathering. Security guards shoved Dan Rather of CBS while he was on the air, and outside the convention hall a clash between protesters and the police turned into a riot. The Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, dropped slightly in the polls after the convention. Oh, and this may sound familiar: Some top Democrats were not at the convention, because of intraparty fights. Mr. McGovern fell a remarkable 10 points in the polls after it ended and ultimately lost in a landslide to Richard Nixon. His caveat \u2013 so far \u2013 is the reason we can\u2019t yet make a final judgment. Donald Trump still has to deliver the convention\u2019s most important speech, and the polls still have to offer the public judgment\u2019s. Perhaps Mr. Trump will somehow find a way to appeal to disaffected voters who are perfectly happy to watch him anger the Republican establishment. Advertisement"}

He was 86.The cause was cancer, said Charlotte Moore, his companion and the artistic director of the Irish Repertory Theater.Mr. McMartin, a versatile actor and singer, was a favorite of the director and choreographer Bob Fosse, the producer and director Harold Prince and Mr. Sondheim \u2014 who, asked by the critic Frank Rich in 2000 to name his favorite star performances in a musical, unhesitatingly singled out two: Alfred Drake in \u201cKismet\u201d and Mr. McMartin in \u201cFollies.\u201dHe made his first big splash on Broadway in 1966 opposite Gwen Verdon in Mr. Fosse\u2019s \u201cSweet Charity.\u201d As the claustrophobic Oscar Lindquist, he quailed in a broken elevator while Ms. Verdon bucked up his spirits with \u201cI\u2019m the Bravest Individual,\u201d handling the tough assignment of playing Mr. Nice Guy to a bundle of emotional dynamite. At Mr. Fosse\u2019s invitation, he traveled to Hollywood to repeat the role opposite Shirley MacLaine in the movie version in 1969.Mr. McMartin later played the narrator in the 2002 revival of Mr. Sondheim\u2019s \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d earning the last of his five Tony Award nominations. (He never won.)As a member of the New Phoenix Repertory Company in the 1970s, Mr. McMartin was directed by Mr. Prince on Broadway in the Eugene O\u2019Neill play \u201cThe Great God Brown\u201d and the Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt play \u201cThe Visit.\u201d He later appeared as Cap\u2019n Andy in Mr. Prince\u2019s 1994 revival of \u201cShow Boat.\u201dIn his later years, Mr. McMartin\u2019s mellifluous baritone and distinguished looks kept him in constant employment as a patrician father, a professor or a politician on the stage and screen and in dozens of television appearances. His last stage role was as the Georgia senator Richard Russell, alongside Bryan Cranston as Lyndon B. Johnson, in \u201cAll the Way\u201d in 2014.John Francis McMartin was born on Nov. 18, 1929, in Warsaw, Ind., and grew up in St. Cloud, Minn. His father, Royal, was a traveling salesman, and his mother, the former Alice Sniska, was a homemaker.After graduating from high school he enlisted in the Army and served with the 101st Airborne Division as a paratrooper. While performing in service shows, he got the acting itch.He attended Columbia College in Chicago but did not earn a degree. Instead he found work with a summer stock company in Allentown, Pa., where he met the actress Eileen Brennan. After gaining more seasoning he headed to New York, where Ms. Brennan, a step ahead of him, invited him to join the cast of \u201cLittle Mary Sunshine,\u201d an operetta that opened Off Broadway to rapturous reviews in 1959.In 1960 he married Cynthia Baer, one of the show\u2019s producers. The marriage ended in divorce.In addition to Ms. Moore, he is survived by two daughters, Susan and Kathleen McMartin; a brother, James; a sister, Mary Schultz; and three grandchildren.Mr. Fosse cast Mr. McMartin in two flops, \u201cThe Conquering Hero\u201d and \u201cPleasures and Palaces,\u201d which died in out-of-town tryouts. When he asked him to play Oscar in \u201cSweet Charity,\u201d Mr. McMartin recalled in an interview with The Chicago Tribune in 1996, he told Mr. Fosse: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief. I thought you might consider me bad luck.\u201d Mr. Fosse, he said, replied, \u201cThat\u2019s funny; I suspected you thought the same thing about me.\u201dHe did not particularly like to act in films, but did so occasionally. He played the foreign editor of The Washington Post in \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d (1976) and the businessman and philanthropist Huntington Hartford in \u201cKinsey\u201d (2004).He remained busy on the stage into his 70s and 80s, appearing in \u201cGrey Gardens\u201d in 2006 as the father of the eccentric recluse Edith Bouvier and in John Guare\u2019s \u201cA Free Man of Color\u201d in 2011 as Thomas Jefferson.When Mr. Prince asked him to join the cast of \u201cShow Boat,\u201d he begged off, saying he was not right for the part of Cap\u2019n Andy, but eventually gave in.\u201cI love it when Cap\u2019n Andy says in the last act, \u2018The lucky people are the ones that get to do what they enjoy doin\u2019,\u2019\u201d Mr. McMartin told The Chicago Tribune. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I feel about my work. I\u2019m one of the lucky people.\u201dAn obituary on Friday about the actor John McMartin referred incorrectly to a production of the Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt play \u201cThe Visit\u201d in which he appeared on Broadway in the 1970s. It was not a musical. (He did appear in a later musical version of \u201cThe Visit,\u201d although not on Broadway.) The obituary also misspelled the given name of an actor with whom Mr. McMartin appeared in the Broadway play \u201cAll the Way\u201d in 2014. He is Bryan Cranston, not Brian.An obituary on Friday about the actor John McMartin referred incorrectly to his work at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.

With his warm, husky voice, Mr. Castillo brought an assertive (if sometimes prideful) sense of dignity to Richie, a refreshing contrast to the first-world neuroses of the central characters, Patrick, Dom and Agust\u00edn.Where the three friends hemmed and hawed over their love lives and ambitions, Richie seemed to know exactly what he wanted.Wearing a gray T-shirt with a pair of Ray-Bans slung over the neckband, Mr. Castillo sat down for lunch at a restaurant on West 42nd Street. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a black sheep in some ways,\u201d he said, \u201cand I identified with that in the character.\u201dMr. Castillo traces his acting instincts to his birthplace, the border town McAllen, Tex.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Night Of\u2019 Takes a Cab Ride to Hell", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byIn the beginning, there was the procedural. \u201cDragnet,\u201d \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and the like set the template for television crime stories that took viewers briskly though the process by which bad guys get caught.In the fictional \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d as in those stories, someone dies, and someone goes to trial, but the biggest suspect is the notion of egalitarian justice.The worst night of Nasir Khan\u2019s life begins with promise. The studious, sexually inexperienced son of Pakistani immigrants, Naz, as he is known, drives his father\u2019s cab from Queens to Manhattan, headed to a party. He\u2019s told there will be girls.He never makes it. Andrea (Sofia Black-D\u2019Elia), a young woman with sad, faraway eyes, mistakes him for a working cabby and hails a ride. It leads to conversation, a connection, a ride back to her townhouse. And then to drugs, sex \u2014 and Naz\u2019s waking up to find her stabbed to death.Naz (Riz Ahmed) is picked up for the murder, smeared with DNA evidence. In retrospect, you see how the creators, Steven Zaillian (\u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d) and Richard Price (\u201cThe Wire\u201d), staged Naz\u2019s last night of freedom \u2014 a straight-arrow college kid\u2019s walk on the wild side \u2014 as a pit of circumstantial quicksand: the casual encounters that will become eyewitness testimony; the chain of bad breaks, bad timing and bad decisions.Mind your armrests when you watch it all unfold; you may clutch them right through the upholstery.Stone\u2019s part was meant for James Gandolfini (still listed as a producer). It would have been fascinating to see that bearish actor play a courthouse sad sack, but Mr. Turturro is a fine fit, as is Mr. Camp. They\u2019re a pair of scuffed shoes on opposite feet of the law.The early episodes have a theaterlike intimacy, and they pay close attention to the particulars of arrest and processing. Mr. Ahmed deftly shows Naz\u2019s dawning terror as his world becomes ever smaller; the cinematography conveys the isolation, the disorientation, the feeling of being funneled down a dank, fluorescent-lit chute into the system.It\u2019s a slow ride to hell, last stop Rikers Island. A corrections officer asks Naz if he belongs to a gang; he doesn\u2019t, but it turns out that \u201cyes\u201d would have been the better answer. \u201cWell, then, good luck to you,\u201d the officer says. Prison is its own confounding gantlet, overseen by an imperious inmate, Freddy (Michael Kenneth Williams, characteristically smoldering), who may matter more to Naz\u2019s survival than any judge.The later episodes become a more conventional legal story, as Stone patches together a defense, and the case becomes Nancy Grace-ified in the media. There are nods to TV legal series throughout. When Stone prints crime-scene graphics at a copy shop, the clerk asks if he works for \u201cLaw & Order\u201d; prisoners at Rikers spend break time watching daytime court shows.As a legal procedural, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d is richly detailed but profoundly unglamorous. A running subplot involves Stone\u2019s unappetizing case of foot eczema. His journey from doctor to herbal healer to doctor, looking for a cure, becomes a symbol for the befuddling process of navigating the legal system. Justice, in this grand, grim story, has feet not of clay but of gross, itchy, mortal flesh.But still it must stumble forward.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Asperger\u2019s Are Us Comedy Troupe Jokes About Everything but That", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byBALTIMORE \u2014 Audiences don\u2019t usually know what to expect from Asperger\u2019s Are Us, a Boston sketch comedy troupe made up solely of artists on the autism spectrum. Will they use self-deprecating humor about life with Asperger\u2019s syndrome? Are they hoping to shed light on a serious condition? Will they be something like Sheldon, the socially inept character on CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d?The answer, it turns out, is none of the above.Instead of focusing on the condition, the four men who make up the troupe \u2014 Noah Britton, New Michael Ingemi, Jack Hanke and Ethan Finlan \u2014 perform skits and monologues that reflect their thoughts, perspectives and offbeat sensibilities, often characterized by deadpan and absurd humor.In one sketch, they play 18th-century stoners recounting how awesome Mozart was on his 1763 tour, gushing like heavy-metal fans after an AC/DC concert. Sometimes they are 911 operators taking calls from babies panicking because they were playing peek-a-boo with Daddy, and he vanished. \u201cOh wait! He came back!\u201d a toddler says.Mr. Britton, who often wears a T-shirt with the words \u201cI don\u2019t want your pity,\u201d said the guys are not looking for sympathy laughs or polite applause. Their show is not an autism awareness campaign, they say. They want people to laugh simply because they\u2019re funny.\u201cOur original goal was, \u2018Let\u2019s entertain people who have our sense of humor \u2014 who like that wordplay, who like that absurdism,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut then all these people showed up, as I predicted, who were there out of guilt or curiosity or a sense of \u2018I want to learn more about someone in my family.\u2019 We\u2019re not writing for them, but we understand those people come and we\u2019re happy to have them.\u201dWith each performance, their audience seems to grow. On Thursday, they played a packed show at the Creative Alliance in Baltimore, and on Sunday they will reach their most prestigious stage yet, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.Their condition may require them to practice longer and harder than other comedians: A two-hour rehearsal can stretch to six if they lose focus, which happens easily. But they consider themselves serious practitioners of their craft. Their heroes include Monty Python, Andy Kaufman and Steven Wright, and some of their more contemporary inspirations, like Mark Proksch and Joe Pera, are now performing alongside them.The troupe members met at a summer acting camp for teenagers with Asperger\u2019s. Mr. Britton, who was a counselor while the others were students, was drawn to that camp because it gave participants something he wished he\u2019d gotten at that age.\u201cEven like in 2005, Asperger\u2019s services were terrible,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis camp was amazing because they approached it like, \u2018We\u2019re going to take you guys\u2019s good qualities, we\u2019re going to have a bunch of fun, we\u2019re going to play some acting games, and you\u2019re going to make friends with people who are like you.\u2019 And that\u2019s what all of us were looking for.\u201dThough they want to be seen as comedians, they realize that for better or worse, their audiences also want to know more about autism, and during Q. and A.s at the end of their shows, fans ask about everything from cures to \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201dThe comics have a lot of disdain for that sitcom, which they liken to a minstrel show and which they argue relies on making fun of a character like Sheldon, the awkward scientist played by Jim Parsons.\u201cI don\u2019t want everyone to assume, \u2018Oh wow, these guys have Asperger\u2019s, therefore this person I know with Asperger\u2019s is going to be like them,\u201d Mr. Britton said. \u201cWe do want to inspire people with Asperger\u2019s to know they can do lots of cool stuff.\u201d\u201cJust not comedy,\u201d Mr. Hanke joked. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 Returns for a Hilarious and Hallucinatory Season 3", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe premise felt like one more cynical take on showbiz shallowness and debauchery \u2014 \u201cEntourage\u201d and \u201cEpisodes\u201d crammed into two ends of a horse costume. The players were familiar types: an entitled, has-been title character (Will Arnett); his tightly wound agent and ex-lover, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), a cat; his shiftless houseguest, Todd (Aaron Paul), a 20-something human; his amiable frenemy, a Labrador retriever named Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins).But by the middle of the first season and throughout its spectacular second one, \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg, revealed itself as another, much more thoughtful creature.Tired of living on the residual money and fame from his corny hit \u201990s sitcom (\u201cHorsin\u2019 Around,\u201d about a horse who adopts three human children), BoJack decides to pursue his dream of starring in the biopic \u201cSecretariat.\u201d (Tagline: \u201cHe\u2019s tired of running in circles.\u201d) The process forces him to get serious about his work, to confront the number of people he\u2019s hurt over the course of his career and, ultimately, to grapple with his own self-destructiveness and depression.BoJack, an ass of a horse, is right in the wheelhouse of Mr. Arnett, who has played self-centered oafs like Gob Bluth in \u201cArrested Development.\u201d But he\u2019s also deeply, well, human: self-absorbed, self-destructive, but self-aware enough to know that he wants to be better than he is, even as he fails.In the third season, which arrives on Friday on Netflix, BoJack has realized his goal \u2014 kind of. After he flaked out on the set of \u201cSecretariat,\u201d the director completed his scenes by using a C.G.I. horse \u2014 which, it turned out, played the role better than BoJack himself.Now he\u2019s doing an awards-season press tour under the eye of his \u201cOscar whisperer\u201d publicist, Ana Spanikopita (Angela Bassett), taking credit for the work of an improved electronic simulacrum of himself.For the BoJack we thought we knew in the beginning of the series, this might be enough: praise, validation and love, without having to work for them. Now, he realizes, he wants to be good enough to have done it.But actually doing the work is hard, and in the amniotic infinity pool of celebrity that BoJack floats in, there are too many incentives just to do the easy thing. BoJack is, among other things, an addict \u2014 booze, drugs, sex \u2014 and the endorphin rush of public adulation is one of the toughest buzzes for him to kick.The Oscar campaign provides the arc of the new season, as BoJack endures press interviews (including one with a reporter from \u201cManatee Fair\u201d) and schmoozes with industry types at parties including a \u201cbat bat mitzvah,\u201d where the young celebrant becoming an adult is, in fact, a bat. (\u201cBoJack\u201d is not above a broad animal joke; when Ana orders soup in a restaurant, the waiter who brings it is, naturally, a fly.)The absurdist comedy and hallucinatory visuals match the series\u2019s take on Hollywood as a reality-distortion field. But the series never takes an attitude of easy superiority to its showbiz characters. At heart, \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d is a comedy about lonely people (and animals) who are never by themselves.That melancholy spirit comes through beautifully in the stunning fourth episode of the new season, in which BoJack has to attend the premiere of \u201cSecretariat\u201d at the Pacific Ocean Film Fest, held underwater.When he arrives by submarine, he\u2019s fitted with a diving helmet that muffles the sound, and the sea creatures speak in unintelligible squeaks. He can\u2019t understand anyone, and no one can understand him. Cranky and confused, BoJack wanders off and ends up on an underwater bus, helping a pregnant male sea horse (biology lesson here) deliver a litter of babies.The episode unfolds almost entirely free of dialogue, with a trippy electronic score. I could watch it again and again. It\u2019s like a marriage of \u201cLost in Translation\u201d and a Chuck Jones Looney Tunes short, haunting, disorienting and ingeniously slapstick.But the episode is also distinctively \u201cBoJack\u201d in the way that it forces its protagonist to push past his alienation and, briefly, care for someone other than himself. Show business is this comedy\u2019s setting, but its real subject is connection, and the hurdles that people put in the way of it. For \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d the race to happiness is not a straightaway; it\u2019s a steeplechase.Advertisement"}

Thanks to everyone who told us what they want to see. We received more than 2,500 emails.All over California, communities are grappling with a shortage of affordable housing.Is Airbnb part of the problem?The company is increasingly at odds with local governments in the state.Airbnb has resisted, accusing officials of overreaching.Now, Airbnb is in a legal battle with its hometown, San Francisco, which has brought up wrenching questions about inequality, neighborhood change and the free market.Founded inside a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a major local success story.But Airbnb has also become a focal point for anger at the tech industry \u2014 even more so than the Google buses that bring workers to jobs in Silicon Valley.Short-term rentals in San Francisco are being blamed, at least in part, for rising rents that are driving out longtime residents.Last year, Airbnb spent more than $8 million to defeat a ballot measure that would have limited rentals to no more than 75 nights a year.Last month, San Francisco supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that would fine Airbnb $1,000 per day for each host listed on its website who is not registered with the city.\u201cThis legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb,\u201d the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s this very visible sign of the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just of gentrification, but of how wide the disparity is between people who have opportunities and people who don\u2019t.\u201dWhen questioned by reporters about the state budget, which he signed this week, Governor Brown responded with a parable, Aesop\u2019s \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper.\u201dAesop, an ancient Greek fabulist, \u201chas some credibility,\u201d Mr. Brown said.That was one of the governor\u2019s less obscure literary references.Since returning to Sacramento in 2011 for a second stint as governor, he has quoted poets, religious scholars and biologists.He invoked the book of Genesis, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a king of Spain and \u201cThe Little Engine That Could\u201d all in the same 2013 speech.\u201cOver the mountain the little engine went \u2014 we are going to get over that mountain,\u201d he said, making an analogy to California\u2019s high-speed rail plan after quoting the children\u2019s book.The unusual source material has perplexed some analysts.But his literary breadth may also help reinforce his image as a wise, old \u2014 well, experienced (he\u2019s 78) \u2014 politician, who will keep his party\u2019s impulses to spend in check.During a speech last year about climate change, Mr. Brown said proudly that he was among the last politicians with a classics degree.\u201cIt does come in handy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause some of the same mistakes have been made over and over again.\u201dCalifornia Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.Advertisement"}

Addressing them will require sustained effort on your part, not a fleeting exchange with an advice column. I am really sorry for your family history. But as adult children, we are responsible for the way we feel (now), which often requires working through issues in a supportive environment. Log off Facebook and get on with your life.A friend and I use the same hairdresser, who knows that we are friends. She charges $25 for a haircut, and I tip her $5.

Too often, they earn more, spend more and \u2014 just when you least expect it \u2014 their children do better than ours on standardized tests.

But that\u2019s what happened when The Denver Post decided to form a team to cover Colorado\u2019s legalized marijuana industry.The writers offer their personal takes on the debate around legalized marijuana, especially Brittany Driver, who fears child services will use her articles against her.

{"Headline": "Netflix, Once Invincible, Suffers Big Drop in Growth", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byNetflix isn\u2019t looking so invincible anymore.Netflix added just 1.7 million new streaming members in the three months that ended June 30, about half the 3.3 million net additions from the same period the previous year. That anemic growth \u2014 for both United States and international subscribers \u2014 came in well below its forecast of 2.5 million new members.Reed Hastings, the company\u2019s chief executive, typically avoids getting swept up in the ecstasy and the agony for Netflix on Wall Street and beyond. Yet during an earnings call, he apologized to investors \u201cfor the volatility.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s not easy on everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big picture is very much intact, and we\u2019re very excited about it.\u201dAt the time, the company\u2019s share had been soaring, surging 135 percent in 2015 as the top performer on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.So far this year, Netflix\u2019s share price has declined about 14 percent. And Mr. Hastings now is defending the feasibility of the company\u2019s long-term outlook. He reiterated the company\u2019s goal of reaching 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the United States. (Netflix now has 46 million subscribers in the United States.) He also is sticking to his promise to deliver material profits in 2017 and beyond after running roughly at break-even profitability through this year.\u201cI don\u2019t see why 10, 20 years from now, why every American household isn\u2019t subscribing to Netflix, except for maybe competition,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to stay on our toes on that basis.\u201dStill, the company has much to prove. Executives said that while gross additions were on target, there was more churn than normal, largely because of the completion of its two-year plan to increase monthly prices for subscribers. By the end of this year, Netflix will have completed a so-called grandfathering plan to increase prices. In the United States, three different tiers now cost $8, $10 and $12.In the United States, Netflix added just 160,000 new streaming members during the quarter. Executives said that neither increased competition from other streaming services nor market saturation was a factor in the slowing growth in the United States.Outside the United States, Netflix added 1.5 million new subscribers, for a total of 33.4 million.In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Hastings acknowledged that Netflix was not growing \u201cas fast as we like or have been.\u201d\u201cDisrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever,\u201d he said.Still, some analysts pointed to the company\u2019s financials as proof that it would continue to deliver on its plans in the long term. Net income for the quarter was $41 million, up 58 percent from $26 million during the same period last year. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 27 percent from $1.6 billion in the same period last year.\u201cWhile results are softer than expected, I think the market is underappreciating acceleration in revenue,\u201d Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura, said in an email.\u201cNetflix is transitioning from a story about net growth in subscribers to one of growth in revenue and margins,\u201d he added. \u201cThey continue to grow international over the long term, and nothing happens overnight.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Live Streaming Breaks Through, and Cable News Has Much to Fear", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhat we saw last week was live streaming\u2019s Gulf War, a moment that will catapult the technology into the center of the news \u2014 and will begin to inexorably alter much of television news as we know it. And that\u2019s not a bad thing. Though it will shake up the economics of TV, live streaming is opening up a much more compelling way to watch the news.These scenes suggest that streaming apps don\u2019t just have the potential to bring us stories more quickly than TV can. They also greatly expand on the kind of stories you normally see. Streaming news stretches our collective point of view, showing us perspectives from people who might otherwise have been ignored by the news, and from places where television cameras would never have happened to be.\u201cI think we saw last week that Facebook Live could become the most intelligent cable news network ever built,\u201d said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN, who now runs a digital media company called Tapp. With more than 1.65 billion users, he said, \u201cFacebook effectively has one and a half billion news bureaus to capture news, and they\u2019re capable of doing things that a cable news network could only dream of doing.\u201dSoon you might log on to Facebook and see, right at the top of your feed, a collection of videos produced by professionals and amateurs and tailored to your interests \u2014 breaking news and analysis related to topics you like, all of which load instantly in your feed, ad-free, and without any of the constant, interminable waiting for stuff to happen that characterizes traditional cable news.Now that rampart is disappearing. If you turned on one of the cable news networks last week, you would have most likely seen videos lifted straight from streaming apps playing in endless televised loops. If you watched for more than a few minutes, you would have been forgiven for wondering, \u201cWait, if all this video is coming from Facebook, why am I watching TV?\u201dIn the past, an aged audience might not have raised red flags, because it was generally the case that younger people grew into their parents\u2019 news habits. But as online alternatives improve, the less likely that is to happen.\u201cThe next generation just doesn\u2019t ever intend to watch the 6 o\u2019clock or 11 o\u2019clock or any other newscast,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News who is now a visiting researcher at the MIT Media Lab.It\u2019s possible to make too much of the threat that live streaming poses to TV news. \u201cCitizen journalism\u201d has gotten a lot of attention from techno-optimists in the last decade, but blogging, tweeting, podcasting and everything else haven\u2019t replaced traditional journalism so much as they have expanded its tone and range. That\u2019s likely to happen on TV too; streaming apps won\u2019t kill CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, but as the apps become more popular, they will force TV news providers to shift their approach to coverage.\u201cThe more chaotic and unstructured the world of online live video becomes, the more important the curator, analyst or honest broker of information can be,\u201d Mr. Heyward said.In the best situation, TV news could become just such an honest broker: Instead of showing you only the news of the day and the most superficial hot-take debates surrounding it, TV networks could respond to the internet by pumping more resources into in-depth reporting, analysis and explanation, cultivating a wider range of perspectives.As Mr. Klein put it, \u201cMaybe all these years, the importance of scintillating video has been overblown, and the mission for news outlets could be to help viewers understand what all that video really means.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power of \u2018Why?\u2019 and \u2018What If?\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsRecently I had a conversation with a chief executive who expressed concern about several of her senior managers. They were smart, experienced, competent. So what was the problem? \u201cThey\u2019re not asking enough questions,\u201d she said.This wouldn\u2019t have been a bad thing in the business world of a few years ago, where the rules for success were: Know your job, do your work, and if a problem arises, solve it and don\u2019t bother us with a lot of questions.But increasingly I\u2019m finding that business leaders want the people working around them to be more curious, more cognizant of what they don\u2019t know, and more inquisitive \u2014 about everything, including \u201cWhy am I doing my job the way I do it?\u201d and \u201cHow might our company find new opportunities?\u201dI may be hyper-aware of this trend because I think of myself as a \u201cquestionologist,\u201d having studied the art of questioning and written a book about it. But I also think there are real forces in business today that are causing people to value curiosity and inquiry more than in the past.Companies in many industries today must contend with rapid change and rising uncertainty. In such conditions, even a well-established company cannot rest on its expertise; there is pressure to keep learning what\u2019s new and anticipating what\u2019s next. It\u2019s hard to do any of that without asking questions.Asking questions can help spark the innovative ideas that many companies hunger for these days. In the research for my book, I studied business breakthroughs \u2014 including the invention of the Polaroid instant camera and the Nest thermostat and the genesis of start-ups like Netflix, Square and Airbnb \u2014 and found that in each case, some curious soul looked at a current problem and asked insightful questions about why that problem existed and how it might be tackled.The Polaroid story is my favorite: The inspiration for the instant camera sprang from a question asked in the mid-1940s by the 3-year-old daughter of its inventor, Edwin H. Land. She was impatient to see a photo her father had just snapped, and when he tried to explain that the film had to be processed first, she wondered aloud, \u201cWhy do we have to wait for the picture?\u201dSo how can companies encourage people to ask more questions? There are simple ways to train people to become more comfortable and proficient at it. For example, question formulation exercises can be used as a substitute for conventional brainstorming sessions. The idea is to put a problem or challenge in front of a group of people and instead of asking for ideas, instruct participants to generate as many relevant questions as they can. Kristi Schaffner, an executive at Microsoft, regularly conducts such exercises there and says they sharpen analytical skills.Getting employees to ask more questions is the easy part; getting management to respond well to those questions can be harder. When leaders claim they want \u201ceveryone to ask more questions,\u201d I sometimes (in my bolder moments) ask: \u201cDo you really want that? And what will you do with those questions once people start asking them?\u201dFor questioning to thrive in a company, management must find ways to reward the behavior \u2014 if only by acknowledging the good questions that have been asked. For example, I visited one company that asked all employees to think of \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201chow might we\u201d questions about the company\u2019s goals and plans. Management and employees together decided which of these mission questions were best, then displayed them on banners on the walls.Leaders can also encourage companywide questioning by being more curious and inquisitive themselves. This is not necessarily easy for senior executives, who are used to being the ones with the answers. I\u2019ve noticed during questioning exercises at some companies that top executives sit in the back of the room, laptops open, attending to other business; they seem to think their employees are the only ones who need to learn. As they do this, these leaders are modeling precisely the kind of incurious behavior they\u2019re trying to change in others.They could set a better example by asking \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u201d \u2014 while asking others to do likewise. And as the questions proliferate, some good answers are likely to follow.WARREN BERGER is the author of \u201cA More Beautiful Question\u201d (Bloomsbury USA).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laying Bare the Trump Family\u2019s Costume Designs in Cleveland", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayThere they were Thursday night in Cleveland, arrayed onstage as confetti and red, white and blue balloons tumbled from the ceiling: the Trump family, resplendent for all to see, smiling and waving and standing around a little awkwardly, but mesmerizing in their consistent style. Rarely has one family looked so, well, coordinated. And well coordinated.But they also clearly understood that their statements of support did not stop at the podium and the teleprompter. Offstage, they were still consistently on camera, and while sitting in their family box, they continued the narrative, each playing his or her role.A lot of attention has been paid to the crazy outfits on display on the convention floor (Cheese hats for the Wisconsin delegation! Stars and stripes and stetsons for Texas!) but as was clear after four days of programming, the would-be first family had its own, very specific, sartorial strategy.For example, Donald J. Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr. and Eric have adopted the quasi-1980s banker style, a combination of sharp suits, colorful ties, stripes and slicked-back hair that looks kind of like a blend of Gordon Gekko in \u201cWall Street,\u201d Jordan Belfort in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and their father, and that acts like a subliminal wormhole, sending anyone who sees them back to the go-go days of the Reagan era, which have taken on a halcyon quality in Republican mythology.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron, popped up on Thursday night in a suit, tie and slicked-back hair. And he\u2019s 10.Their father says he is going to make America great again, and there they are, unapologetically modeling the moment he is talking about.For their part, Mr. Trump\u2019s daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, as well as Donald Jr. and Eric\u2019s wives adopted a minimalist, manicured style \u2014 sleeveless sheath dresses, pumps, simple hair that takes hours to perfect \u2014 could be defined as newscaster-meets-\u201cVeep\u201d: a television-friendly version of the high-powered woman\u2019s working wardrobe.It\u2019s a style that is not threatening (see the peach-tone look Ivanka wore to introduce her father Thursday night), but that is also not frivolous, hence emphasizing their testimony about their father\u2019s ambitions for them, as well as his attitude toward promoting women.This may sound one-dimensional, but then, so did many of the speeches. Subtlety does not often play well on the prime-time small screen.Which would be them. To think that image does not play a part in the attempt to manipulate perception is to deny a basic reality that any producer, and politician, understands.Advertisement"}

If the other Ghostbusters were, say, Ms. Henson, Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabourey Sidibe as the scientists, and Ms. Jones\u2019s Patty was still the subway worker, who\u2019d care? But under the circumstances, it just seems like the same questionable, stay-in-your-place choice that movies have always made for black performers \u2014 and an excuse for the plot to ride the subway. But, look: She\u2019s an equal member of the team and black people work in public transit. Politics!What do we make of the movie\u2019s fetishization of Chris Hemsworth? He\u2019s very funny as himbo man-meat. But somebody involved with this movie clearly thinks he\u2019s utterly captivating \u2014 or politically necessary, too. A lot of the plot hinges on him being against-type funny. And I actually found the comedic material to be there for him in a way it wasn\u2019t for almost everyone else, especially Melissa McCarthy, who, maybe, shouldn\u2019t be a straight man after all. I wanted gonzo from this movie and got dutiful. What\u2019s wrong with me?I did my best to ignore the anti-reboot chatter before I saw \u201cGhostbusters\u201d just because I avoid reading anyone else\u2019s opinion about a movie before seeing it. I knew that there was a contingent of angry male fans; of course there were. There are always men enraged by women\u2019s autonomy, whether women are starring in a comedy reboot or \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d; playing rock or video games; demanding their reproductive rights; running for president; or, you know, doing anything that some men don\u2019t want them to do. The depths of this rage betray a deep fear about a loss of male power that\u2019s been central to the cultural, social and political landscape for decades.\u201cGhostbusters\u201d turns on the threat of one apocalypse; the irrational hatred toward it turns on another end time.Any more than it would be in a western or a platoon picture or a Mafia epic or a movie about a bunch of tech bros building a start-up. (Follow-up think-piece assignment: \u201cGhostbusters\u201d is actually a remake of \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d)\u201cBridesmaids,\u201d \u201cThe Heat\u201d and \u201cSpy\u201d may have had naughtier (and funnier) jokes, but they were also careful to include rom-com flourishes and semiplausible love interests. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d doesn\u2019t do that. Nor does it pander to the male gaze.And it\u2019s not really out to prove that women can be strong or funny or handle powerful weapons. In most movies, such offers of proof are accompanied by reassurances that the women in question are still sexy or maternal or eager to settle down with the right guy \u2014 that they fulfill some kind of conventional idea of femininity. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d doesn\u2019t bother with any of that, and in the process seems to be on the verge of inventing a new set of archetypes.Advertisement"}

Directed by one of the show\u2019s creators, Andrew Haigh, the movie brings to an end a drama about a group of gay friends in San Francisco. The series divided viewers with its talky storytelling, go-there sex scenes and spotlight on Mr. Groff\u2019s character, a narcissistic video game designer.Mr. Groff recently talked about the legacy of \u201cLooking\u201d and the church of Fincher.

But the audience was too small.Was it too gay?What made it interesting, at least for me watching it back, is that it was so gay. There\u2019s anal douching and all of that. It wasn\u2019t super in your face, even though the subjects were. The timing wasn\u2019t right for it to explode in the way that we wished that it would have.Take a time machine back to your 16-year-old self. Would watching \u201cLooking\u201d have changed your life?The whole show is very romantic. It\u2019s about relationships. In the commercial, it\u2019s two men kissing each other. I just never saw that except on \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d and that was very powerful for me to see. Did you feel a need to portray gay in a responsible way, as in: You\u2019ve got this platform, and you\u2019ve got to get it right?I didn\u2019t think about that. It\u2019s not until after you watch it, for me at least, that I start to think about that, about how does this fit in the culture? I was thinking about bringing Patrick to life, flaws and all. He\u2019s kind of like the all-American responsible Midwestern white dude. But he can really not be a good guy. I love living in those uncomfortable places.What can you tell me about the new David Fincher show?I\u2019m not really allowed to say anything. It\u2019s called \u201cMindhunter.\u201d It\u2019s based on the book \u201cMindhunter\u201d by John Douglas, so it\u2019s about the birth of criminal profiling. I can say that I\u2019ve become a David Fincher disciple. I have been completely turned.What will bring you back to Broadway? Will there be a \u201cLooking\u201d musical?A \u201cLooking\u201d musical would completely bring me back to Broadway. I would come back in a second. Some people have the gift where they can just sing. I don\u2019t have the fail-safe voice, so it has to be something that I need to sing about.What do you need to sing about?I don\u2019t know.

{"Headline": "Beetles Do Beatles: Music Coup for an Animated Netflix Show", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byIf Josh Wakely was feeling a little fried, it was understandable: He had quickly become one of the busiest young writers and producers in television \u2014 with a little help from the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Motown.Jet-lagged from repeated trips between New York, Los Angeles and his native Australia, Mr. Wakely, 35, sported a dark stubble and had an errant shirt button undone one afternoon last week at his publicist\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan. But he excitedly tripped over his own syllables as he talked about his three new shows, each of which uses classic pop songs as inspiration, raw material and organizing theme.\u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d an animated children\u2019s series on Netflix based on Beatles songs, begins its first season on Aug. 3. The show features performances of songs like \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d and \u201cHelp!\u201d by Eddie Vedder, Pink and Regina Spektor.Also on the way, with air dates yet to be set, are two other shows Mr. Wakely created: \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d a dark drama for Amazon with characters based on songs by Mr. Dylan; and another animated show for Netflix, still untitled, that makes use of the Motown catalog. Smokey Robinson is its executive music producer.As Mr. Wakely described it, his template began with \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d which he conceived of as a way to extend the current \u201cgolden age of television\u201d into children\u2019s programming. He created the show and also has directing, writing and producing credits.\u201cI realized that these extraordinary melodies would make sense for children, but also the full level of imagination and visual imagery that the Beatles had in their songs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it to go into a strawberry field forever? What would it be like to actually be inside that yellow submarine?\u201dMr. Wakely said he chose the music catalogs partly for their storytelling potential, but beyond \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d he provided scant details. \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d he said, would feature characters from Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs \u201ccolliding\u201d in 1960s America. The Motown show follows an 8-year-old African-American boy named Ben who discovers magical powers that let him bring graffiti to life.\u201cBanksy for children as done by Pixar,\u201d Mr. Wakely said of the Motown show. \u201cThat was my pitch.\u201dIf you had access to the songs of some of the best-known musicians, what kind of TV show would you create? Tell us in 100 words or less.\u201cI had no idea how complicated or how ambitious an idea it was,\u201d Mr. Wakely said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was so na\u00efve, because I wouldn\u2019t have pursued it otherwise.\u201dAmong his earlier work was \u201cMy Mind\u2019s Own Melody,\u201d a short musical film in 2012 in which he worked with Daniel Johns of the Australian rock band Silverchair. Yet Mr. Wakely remained well below the radar of the Hollywood press until making the Beatles deal two years ago for \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d which features five childlike insects living in the tall grass of an overgrown backyard who learn a valuable life lesson \u2014 and a catchy Beatles tune \u2014 in each 11-minute episode.Like the most enduring animation series, the writing in \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d is crafted to appeal to children as well as to their parents, with plenty of allusions to lyrics. In the \u201cHelp!\u201d episode, Jay, a headstrong beetle, gets trapped in a glass jar and needs his friends to come to his rescue.\u201cI thought you never needed anybody\u2019s help in any way,\u201d says Kumi, a ladybug.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jay replies, \u201cbut those days are gone, and now I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201dFor Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which represents both the Beatles and Motown songwriting catalogs, the shows are a way to reach a generation of very young potential listeners. Still, Sony/ATV was typically cautious in approving the deal for \u201cBeat Bugs.\u201d\u201cAs a company, we say no more than we say yes,\u201d said Damian Trotter, managing director of Sony/ATV in Australia, who said he has known Mr. Wakely since the beginning of his career and encouraged him to develop ideas for projects using music. After an initial meeting, Mr. Wakely began to sketch out \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d in detail, and Mr. Trotter said the result impressed Sony/ATV enough to give the green light.\u201cHe demonstrated the power of a great idea,\u201d Mr. Trotter said. (Sony/ATV also controls the Motown catalog, and administers Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs in Australia; the Beatles themselves were not involved in the \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d deal.)Mr. Wakely, who splits his time between Los Angeles and Sydney, said at the time the Beatles deal was finally signed in January 2014, his funds were nearly exhausted. He could afford just six weeks of rent in Los Angeles and was prepared to return to Australia. \u201cI would say to my wife, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be the guy that nearly got the Beatles rights,\u2019\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Netflix announced that \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d had been confirmed for a second season, to begin Nov. 18, with Beatles songs to be sung by Jennifer Hudson, Rod Stewart and Tori Kelly, among others. Mr. Wakely has his hands full, but he said he was already thinking of more music-focused shows.\u201cIt feels like beautifully uncharted territory,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

There are definite advantages to such sustained, concentrated theatergoing. Patterns \u2014 cultural, commercial, political \u2014 seem to emerge more clearly for me than they do in New York, at least as seen through the glazed eyes of a jet-lagged Yank on a marathon.Even stateside, I\u2019m a devoted reader of the news reports out of London. And I\u2019m always looking for how what I\u2019m reading is reflected on the stages in the West End and London fringes.Often, there\u2019s a quicker turnaround time than Broadway affords in bringing a new work to the boards. David Hare\u2019s \u201cStuff Happens,\u201d about the American and British invasion of Iraq, and Richard Bean\u2019s \u201cGreat Britain,\u201d about the newspaper phone-hacking scandal, showed up at the National when their subjects were still the stuff of current headlines.Of course, it\u2019s probably a bit early for \u201cBrexit\u201d and the recent upheavals at Downing Street and among the major parties to be given literal stage life.

{"Headline": "What You Should Watch: Smart, Non-Violent TV", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byWatchingWhen you write about TV, people ask you about TV a lot. Which is great for me \u2014 I love talking about television. And one question people ask me a lot, and one that I\u2019ve gotten more in the last year than ever before, is \u201cwhat shows do other people ask you about?\u201dThose shows are all dazzling and conversation-worthy in their own ways, and I never get tired of that moment of bliss and connection that happens when people discover a mutual favorite series. There\u2019s plenty of good stuff to watch this week. Maybe we\u2019ll all watch it together.Watch if you like intimate family dramas, humanely told stories and flawed but well-constructed characters.Dear Watching,I feel like a kid complaining that there\u2019s nothing on, but I just can\u2019t seem to get interested in a series. And I need one. Badly. My co-workers talk endlessly about \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but it\u2019s too removed from reality for my taste.I want something smart and interesting, that isn\u2019t violent, and that has at least a few admirable characters. I\u2019m sick of antiheroes and I don\u2019t want to wind up depressed or disillusioned. I know I have it in my heart to love another show, though I confess I\u2019m still not completely over \u201cMad Men.\u201d But now that \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d is over I don\u2019t have a single show to watch. Help! \u2014 Hopeful and PatientDear Hopeful,\u201cJane\u201d is a kicky telenovela, about a bright young woman who finds herself accidentally inseminated \u2014 it\u2019s funny and thoughtful, and it\u2019s a show that sees the dignity in all of its characters, even the ostensible villains.But don\u2019t write it off as just a delightful soap. There are complex techniques at work here. Jane is an aspiring writer, and the show plays with different formats, weaving together a meta-narrative about the significance of stories in our lives. Even if you think of yourself as someone who prefers more \u201cserious\u201d fare, give \u201cJane\u201d a go.The creator Jill Soloway\u2019s work on \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d has some clear echoes here, particularly in the primacy of the relationships between adult siblings, and while the Pfefferman family members are not exactly admirable \u2014 everyone\u2019s self-absorbed and at least sometimes mean \u2014 there are some upstanding secondary characters.\u201cCriminal Justice\u201d has two stand-alone seasons: The first about a cabdriver charged with murder, and the second about a woman who kills her husband. They\u2019re both gripping, but my god are they bleak.It\u2019s the earnest, issues-oriented Canadian teen soap you\u2019ve always loved \u2014 a bonkers amount of drama for any one school, and yet an incredible amount of empathy, loyalty and ethical decision-making, too. It\u2019s arguably the most politically progressive show on TV, and it has as many ripped-from-the-headlines stories as any \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d This current incarnation is as good as \u201cDegrassi\u201d has been in years, with fewer crummy characters and a better, more patient pace for its bigger stories.The show is aimed at tweens and teens, but this season has the reappearance of some favorite characters from 15 years ago. Ostensibly this is to celebrate the series\u2019 500th episode, but I think it\u2019s a shout-out to those of us who\u2019ve been watching the show for a long, long time.\u2022 On Wednesday, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d will air another \u201cWeekend Update\u201d special on MSNBC, after the convention coverage ends, so probably around midnight.\u2022 Stephen Colbert will be live again this week, and his guests include John Oliver (Wednesday) and Doris Kearns Goodwin (Thursday).Advertisement"}

Mr. Lovett, a writer and producer for TV shows like \u201c1600 Penn\u201d and \u201cThe Newsroom,\u201d also worked as a speechwriter under President Obama.It was 2004 when Mr. Favreau first encountered his future boss at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Having gotten his start in Washington in Senator John Kerry\u2019s press office through an internship at the College of the Holy Cross, Mr. Favreau, at 22, was suddenly charged with the excruciating task of informing the senatorial candidate from Illinois that he had to remove a rousing line from his keynote address that Senator Kerry wanted to use. Mr. Obama was not pleased, but he made the change.Mr. Favreau joined Mr. Obama\u2019s team a year later, and in 2009, he became the second-youngest chief White House speechwriter in history.With his Ben Affleck smile and smidgen of a Mass Pike accent to match (he grew up just outside Boston, in Winchester), Mr. Favreau made the gossip pages with uncomfortable regularity.Over old-fashioneds at Soho House West Hollywood, the private members\u2019 club down the block from his apartment (\u201cThis is sort of my second office,\u201d he said), Mr. Favreau appeared fit and happy in a gray T-shirt, jeans and crisp maroon Vans.The go-go life that had him on call 24/8 in Washington has given way to staring at his phone while in gym clothes yelling about Trump University. \u201cI decided to write for The Ringer partly because it gives me a platform, but also because people come dressed to work, and it\u2019s not just my goldendoodle I\u2019m talking to,\u201d he said.His circle in general is tighter than it once was. Mr. Favreau\u2019s brother, Andy, an actor, lives across the street. Mr. Lovett, also a neighbor, said he lives close enough \u201cto access Jon\u2019s Sonos system from my couch to play my entrance music.\u201dHe was on a trip to Los Angeles for a 2009 fund-raising dinner with President Obama at George Clooney\u2019s house when it struck Mr. Favreau that there was more to life than drafting floor statements on Patriot Act reauthorization. As Mr. Favreau put it, \u201cIt was hard to have a real relationship, I didn\u2019t sleep a lot, and there was the Christmas I told my parents, \u2018Let\u2019s hurry up and open presents because I have an inaugural address to write.\u2019\u201d\u201cI believe, with Hillary, that we are stronger together,\u201d he said, \u201cand that this country is a better place when you expand the opportunities to every single person: rich, poor, Muslim, Mexican, gay, woman.\u201dMr. Favreau caught himself slipping into speechmaking mode and laughed.\u201cWhatever I do in life, I end up in the same place,\u201d he said. \u201cWriting about politics, talking about politics. I tried to quit. I can\u2019t quit.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the former White House speechwriter Jon Favreau referred incorrectly to the political office held by Barack Obama when he spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was a candidate that year for the United States Senate seat from Illinois; he had not yet been elected to that post.Advertisement"}

Oh, well. This brooding, stylish series\u2019 third season starts streaming on Amazon on Tuesday. If you have never watched, now\u2019s the time.Or even if you have watched, now\u2019s the time to revisit. Mads Mikkelsen stars as the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and Hugh Dancy as the investigator Will Graham. The show takes place well before the events of \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d and while Season 1 starts with a stronger procedural vibe, that abates pretty quickly, and eventually Will and Hannibal\u2019s relationship becomes more the center of the show, as the series focuses less on ghastly crime-of-the-week stories. Every image on \u201cHannibal\u201d is charged with artistry, eroticism, or both; the show\u2019s carnage is overwhelming, but it\u2019s not played for realism. Instead, it\u2019s often hallucinogenic.\u201cHannibal\u201d is absolutely on the gross side, and Season 3 includes dozens of disturbing scenes, not at all limited to the show\u2019s inborn cannibalism, though of course that\u2019s part of the horror of it all. The series\u2019 creator Bryan Fuller\u2019s other shows \u2014 \u201cDead Like Me,\u201d \u201cWonderfalls,\u201d and \u201cPushing Daisies,\u201d all fantastic \u2014 share a dreamy quirkiness, but here all those fanciful urges are channeled into something darker.The show has 39 total episodes, and certain arcs have cliffhangers that get pretty addictive. But resist the urge to binge this show too quickly, lest its goth romance take over too much of your psyche. Ever read a book on the subway, and then find yourself narrating your life in its voice as you go up the stairs? You don\u2019t want this show\u2019s voice narrating your life. Take some breaks.

{"Headline": "D\u00e9tente for Netflix and Comcast", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe chief executive of Netflix, Reed Hastings, and his counterpart at Comcast, Brian L. Roberts, are putting their desire for growth ahead of their history of mutual gripes. Netflix, the video-streaming service, helped kill the bid of Comcast, the cable provider, for Time Warner Cable. But now Comcast is adding its nemesis to its set-top box.The reason for the d\u00e9tente is pretty simple: Nothing brings out the olive branch like a business opportunity.The relationship between the two companies has often been rocky. It got downright nasty, though, not long ago. Just as Comcast was trying to push through its $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable, Netflix accused it of throttling its service. United States regulators were listening, and Comcast abandoned the deal last year.Such scrapes can cause lasting enmity. But the two companies\u2019 interests are becoming more aligned. Mr. Roberts wants to make Comcast a major content aggregator, with a menu that includes on-demand TV shows, videos from Buzzfeed and other digital media companies and music from Pandora. Its X1 cable box has become a chief lure for attracting new customers and persuading current ones to stay. The strategy appears to be working: Comcast added 53,000 video subscribers last quarter, and customer turnover has improved for 26 consecutive months. Adding Netflix should broaden its appeal.As part of the deal, Mr. Hastings gets access to new subscribers who could potentially help stem his company\u2019s slowing growth. Netflix has already benefited from a similar deal in Britain. According to Morgan Stanley, Netflix doubled its share of Virgin Media subscribers using its service to 28 percent within two years of being integrated into the company\u2019s TiVo box in late 2013.Netflix could use a similar lift back home. If its own forecast is correct, it ended the second quarter with 47 million memberships in the United States. That, though, would be just 1 percent higher than the three months to March, the slowest quarterly growth in more than a year. Tapping into Comcast will give it immediate potential access to the 40 percent of Comcast video customers who already have the X1 \u2013 or some nine million homes \u2013 with the rest following in the next few years. That\u2019s more than enough reason to patch things up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru\u2019 Depicts a Self-Help Prophet", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m gonna show you what to do to reshape yourself,\u201d Mr. Robbins tells the young man, and more than 2,000 pairs of ears prick up. This is what they have come from all over the world, and paid almost $5,000, to learn; and like a carefully honed combination of Elmer Gantry, Dr. Phil and David Copperfield (when Mr. Robbins yanks back the curtain, it\u2019s your deepest psychological wound that\u2019s revealed), their host will not disappoint.Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said for the film\u2019s director, Joe Berlinger, who attended the seminar in 2012 and, according to the publicity notes, wanted to share that \u201clife-changing\u201d experience. To do so, he allowed Mr. Robbins to supply the film\u2019s initial financing and gave him the option of canceling at any point before the end of the seminar. (Any footage already shot could be used by Mr. Robbins for coaching.) And though Mr. Berlinger had final cut, it\u2019s hard to find a single moment here that would be out of place in a promotional video.If anyone has a complaint, we don\u2019t hear it. There are no in-depth interviews with employees or family members and no negative experiences. No film of Mr. Robbins\u2019s early seminars is shown, and nothing is revealed about his education or that of his small army of helpers. We alight only briefly on his childhood (the ghost of an abusive mother flits quickly past), and his wife joins a handful of lesser celebrities in admiring his authenticity.The rest is all hugs, tears and wrenching confessions, set to a meticulously curated soundtrack. Yet the film also dares us to write Mr. Robbins off as a huckster-genius; dipping behind the scenes, it exposes the intensive planning and detailed post-mortems that accompany each daily session. In those moments, we see a man who genuinely seems to care, zeroing in on at-risk souls and following up with money and referrals. But by restricting himself to showing how well Mr. Robbins does his job, Mr. Berlinger mainly reveals how narrowly he has done his own.\u201cTony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru\u201d opens Wednesday at IFC Center in Manhattan; on Friday it begins streaming on Netflix and opens in theaters nationally. It is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 54 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vashti Cunningham, Daughter of an N.F.L. Improvisor, Is Raising the Bar", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byEUGENE, Ore. \u2014 Randall Cunningham, the former cutting-edge N.F.L. quarterback, is now a soft-spoken minister and the coach of a high-jumping prodigy, who happens to be his daughter, Vashti Cunningham. On Sunday, she qualified for the Rio Olympics a month after graduating from high school.\u201cI\u2019ve got a little Buddy in me,\u201d Randall Cunningham, 53, said with a smile, referring to Buddy Ryan, his combative coach with the Philadelphia Eagles, who died last week. \u201cThe determination, the focus, don\u2019t take any prisoners.\u201dOnly 18, Vashti Cunningham is the reigning indoor world champion. She is also tied for the highest jump internationally this year, with a leap of 6 feet 6 \u00bc inches. She finished second Sunday at the United States Olympic track and field trials with a jump of 6-5 \u00bd. Tall and long-limbed, she seemed to hover above the bar like a tilde above a Spanish \u00f1.\u201cShe\u2019s just really lithe and elastic and just very natural,\u201d said Amy Acuff, a five-time Olympian.The next step in Cunningham\u2019s ascendant and newly professional career is the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro next month. Her father sees no reason she could not win a gold medal.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way to train people,\u201d said Randall Cunningham, who also coaches football at Silverado High School in Las Vegas and is the founder of Remnant Ministries there. \u201cYou give them a vision, and they have to keep it in sight.\u201dAs a quarterback, Randall Cunningham was a master of improvisation and the unconventional. And so he is as a coach. He has his daughter binge-watching video of her rivals as if the clips were a Netflix series. She picks and chooses from their jumping styles, and learns something about their personalities, too. From Ruth Beitia of Spain, a two-time European champion, Vashti Cunningham learned the value of being calm and joyful and celebrating the simple elation of floating over a bar.For the qualifying round of the Olympic trials on Friday, she sprinkled her face with glitter and joked about her inability to stay away from social media and \u201cact like you\u2019re older.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m so laid-back and chill because I have not been here before,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for the nerves to hit me.\u201dShe trains only four times a week and does leg lifts, but no squats, in her weight training, seeing no need to bulk up and seeking to avoid knee and ankle injuries that have, in Acuff\u2019s words, left many high-jumping careers littering the freeway leading to the Olympics.\u201cWe\u2019re not six-day-a-week people,\u201d Randall Cunningham said. \u201cIt is one thing to push your body hard. It\u2019s another thing to know how to rest your body, how to recover.\u201dBefore the trials, he simulated the meet during training, pretending to be a public-address announcer, saying that the other favorites had cleared a particular height, then adding, \u201cVashti Cunningham, you\u2019re up.\u201dHer response, she said, was a verbal eye roll.\u201cDad, please leave me alone,\u201d she said.As a father, Randall Cunningham wants his daughter to be a normal teenager. As a coach and a former elite athlete, he implores her to aspire to victory in every competition. The high-jump bar is viewed as an opponent, not merely an impediment. When the bar is set high, above her 6-foot-1 height, she sometimes approaches it and stares it down as if it were a boxing opponent at a weigh-in.The idea is to conquer the jump with her mind before she does with her body.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a confrontation between me and the bar, like I\u2019m going to look at it and realize I can conquer it and I can destroy it, basically,\u201d she said. \u201cI go up and stare it down and realize that if my head can go over it, my body can go over it.\u201dUntil high school, she preferred volleyball to track. But the Cunninghams are a high-jumping family. Randall Cunningham jumped 6-9 in high school in Santa Barbara, Calif., and might have gone higher but for a degenerative bone condition in his right knee. His son, Randall II, won the 2016 N.C.A.A. outdoor championship as a sophomore at Southern California and also qualified for the Olympic trials.It would be a fascinating contest, Vashti Cunningham said, to see who could jump higher, her father or her mother, Felicity de Jager, a retired ballerina who performed for the Dance Theater of Harlem.\u201cI go to her when I need to relax and keep calm,\u201d Vashti Cunningham said. \u201cMy dad is always going to be work, work, work, and she\u2019s a person who\u2019s going to be like, \u2018O.K., you\u2019re still a real human.\u2019\u201dLast summer, after she set a national high school record, her father bought her a white Mercedes S550 as a reward. (\u201cIt\u2019s used \u2014 don\u2019t tell her,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI ironed the seats to make them look brand new.\u201d)In March, she won the United States indoor championships with a personal best of 6-6 \u00bc, a world junior record.A week later, she won the world indoor title with a jump of 6-5, beating some of the international competitors whom she had previously seen only on video. At least indoors, where there was no wind or heat or tens of thousands of spectators to contend with, she was now the equal of her celluloid rivals.\u201cIt was kind of just an eye-opener for me that I can be great as well,\u201d she said.Weeks before her senior prom at Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, she turned professional and signed a contract with Nike. The competition in college would probably not be sufficiently challenging, she said. Now it is on to Rio, which will be her first major outdoor international competition.\u201cMe and my dad are similar athletes,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to win everything I do. I\u2019ll be thankful if I go and don\u2019t win, but there\u2019s always that fire in me that needs to win and wants to win.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Is the Show of the Summer. Let\u2019s Talk About It.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThere are homages, and there are homages so committed that they become practically indistinguishable from the original works.(Spoilers for the debut season of \u201cStranger Things\u2033 follow.)A quick recap: As a group of nerdy misfits played Dungeons & Dragons in a basement in the fictional Hawkins, Ind., something went wrong at the government facility outside town. The net result: 1) an enigmatic, buzz-cutted little girl showed up without explanation, 2) an extra-dimensional beast was unleashed to stalk the countryside, and 3) one of the nerds, Will (Noah Schnapp), disappeared.This last event set the story in motion, sending the town on a search for Will and his mother Joyce (a great Winona Ryder) around the bend, plagued by strange telephone calls and visions. But was she really going crazy with grief, as everyone from her ex to the sad but good-hearted Sheriff Jim Hopper (David Harbour) said she was?Of course not. The mishap at the lab, overseen by Dr. Brenner, a snowy-haired Matthew Modine, opened a gate to an alternate dimension, trapping Will in a gothic, parallel Hawkins, described as \u201cthe Upside Down.\u201d There he hides from the monster, called the Demogorgon after a Dungeons & Dragons creature, and occasionally communicates with his mother and friends across the metaphysical plane. Will\u2019s dead \u201cbody,\u201d discovered in the lake, is revealed to be fake.At the same time, the mysterious girl Eleven, displays telekinetic powers ranging from van-tossing to forced pants-wetting. It turns out she acquired her skills in the womb, thanks to her mother\u2019s stint as a government test subject, and was being trained as a Cold War weapon until she destroyed part of the lab and escaped.\u201cStranger Things\u201d nicely built suspense through having the various components \u2014 the sheriff, Joyce, the kids and Eleven, the teenagers Jonathan and Nancy \u2014 stumble upon different pieces of the story, culminating in the satisfying moment when they all finally start talking to one another.In the end Sheriff Hopper makes a deal to retrieve Will from the Upside Down, where he\u2019s being used as some sort of incubator, in exchange for giving up Eleven\u2019s location to Dr. Brenner. But the girl kills several agents, then vanishes while vanquishing the monster before Dr. Brenner can find her.Will you come back if it does? Let\u2019s discuss.The other big touchstone is John Carpenter, primarily in the moody synth soundtrack, though his films like \u201cThe Fog\u201d and \u201cThe Thing\u201d informed the overall tone of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d (The science teacher watched \u201cThe Thing\u201d during his date night and one of the boys had a poster for it in his room.) Other obvious inspirations include kidventure movies like \u201cThe Goonies\u201d and \u201cStand by Me,\u201d and there were also glimpses of \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (the Christmas light sequences); Indiana Jones (Hopper\u2019s hat) and \u201cNightmare on Elm Street\u201d (the monster coming through the walls, teenagers setting booby traps in a suburban home).\u2022 As a child of the \u201980s, I was right in the \u201cStranger Things\u201d crosshairs, and its period detail enveloped me like a warm blanket of nostalgia. This included the spot-on music choices, from soulful Jonathan\u2019s mixtapes, featuring Joy Division and the Clash, to the cheesier Corey Hart preferred by the privileged kids. But I\u2019m curious: Did younger viewers just find it all sort of tedious?\u2022 My favorite random character was the science teacher, who showed up whenever a tricky concept needed explaining and seemed to have terrible judgment when it came to enabling preteen boys. So it\u2019s late on a Saturday night and you want to build a sensory deprivation chamber? Oh O.K., you crazy scamps. Got a pen and paper?\u2022 What did you think of the Demagorgon? I found it pretty terrifying when Nancy first glimpsed it feeding in the Upside Down. But like most monsters, its power waned the more we saw of it.\u2022 Finally, what did you make of the ending? There were a number of tantalizing loose ends: Sheriff Hopper getting into the mysterious car and then, one month later, leaving out treats for Eleven in the woods. Is he in contact with her? Or is he just trying to atone after selling her out, Lando Calrissian-like, to Dr. Brenner? And why did Nancy get back with Steve?Most important: What do you think was up with Will excusing himself from Christmas dinner to cough up Demogorgon larva and flash between dimensions? Will he be the monster next season?Please share your thoughts in the comments.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a character from the \u201cAlien\u201d films.
