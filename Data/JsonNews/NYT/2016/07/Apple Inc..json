{"Headline": "They Promised Us Jet Packs. They Promised the Bosses Profit.", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byIf the project had been successful \u2014 and this was always a big if \u2014 it would have changed the definition of green energy and potentially undercut some of the most important industries in the world, not least the oil business. But after two years of trying, and an undisclosed research budget, Foghorn died during a January staff meeting.The result: Everyone on the team received a bonus (they won\u2019t say how much).X, formerly called Google X, cheekily refers to itself as \u201cthe moonshot factory.\u201d They are the people behind Google\u2019s self-driving car, along with various out-there projects like Loon, an attempt to beam internet access from stratospheric balloons, and Wing, a drone delivery service. Those efforts sit atop dozens of aborted projects \u2014 some just ideas, others that consumed years \u2014 like a never built jet pack and giant blimps that would haul cargo with the same efficiency as an ocean liner.What all these efforts have in common, besides imaginative power, is that they do not make any money. X\u2019s budget and head count are a secret, but shareholders\u2019 perceptions about the division were aptly summed up by a poster board in its Mountain View, Calif., offices. It had a picture of a burning $100 bill followed by, \u201cInvestors think we do this.\u201dThat poster points to a central question for both X and Alphabet: What exactly is X\u2019s business? And how does a public company invest in such speculative ideas, most of which will never work, without irritating investors or wasting a ton of money?Building a research division is an old and often unsuccessful concept. For decades, corporate giants like AT&T, IBM, Microsoft and Xerox have tried, in varying ways, to organize research-oriented groups in hopes of finding ways to cash in on emerging technologies before their competitors.Those efforts played a role in creating some of the 20th century\u2019s most significant innovations. For instance, Bell Labs, then a division of AT&T, invented the transistor, the foundation of modern electronics. But in many cases these research arms did little for the companies that financed them.Xerox pioneered the graphical interface for computers \u2014 the idea that people could navigate with a mouse rather than typing obscure commands on a screen. But it was a young company named Apple that turned that idea into a giant business.\u201cIn general, the model of having a central research lab that the corporation funds for research into new technologies has not produced much for these companies,\u201d said G. Pascal Zachary, a professor at the Arizona State University School for the Future of Innovation in Society. \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t see many of the successful young companies today thinking about building them.\u201dX is trying to make corporate research systematic by borrowing working ideas from the past, while adding a few wrinkles \u2014 like giving people a financial incentive to admit when something is not working out \u2014 in hopes of not making the same mistakes.This effort comes at a time when Alphabet is trying to enforce financial discipline over a broad empire that was famous for not worrying about nickels and dimes.Next month will be the first anniversary of Google\u2019s surprise announcement that it would remake itself as a holding company. All the ad-driven and highly profitable businesses like search would still be called Google. The assumption was that the other divisions would have to prove they could stand on their own financially \u2014 at least over time.While investors still do not know X\u2019s budget, they at least have a sense of the limits. In the first quarter, Alphabet lost about $800 million on what it called \u201cother bets\u201d \u2014 everything outside Google\u2019s core search and advertising businesses \u2014 and it will update the figure when it reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday.At the same time, now that X is spinning off new companies that will either stand on their own or die, investors are getting something of a yardstick to judge the division\u2019s progress. If one of those new companies starts to rival search advertising as a revenue stream, X will be considered a success. If that never happens, it will be a failure (and not the good kind).For instance, X\u2019s self-driving car project, known internally as Chauffeur, recently hired a chief executive and is poised to become a stand-alone company. Another, called Verily, is a life sciences company that has developed, among other things, a glucose-sensing contact lens for people with diabetes, and has licensed that technology to Novartis. Verily became its own company shortly after Google announced the Alphabet reorganization.\u201cThe thing we created \u2014 our product \u2014 was Verily, and at the highest level we are being paid as an organization to do that somewhat regularly,\u201d said Astro Teller, X\u2019s chief executive, though his actual title is \u201ccaptain of moonshots.\u201d \u201cI would not want to promise anyone internally or externally that we\u2019re going to do it once a year.\u201dThere are two main differences between X and the corporate research arms of the past. While operations like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC worked on problems that were at least nominally related to their parent companies\u2019 core businesses, X employees can work on anything they like. In fact, they are discouraged from straying into Google\u2019s main business because Google has its own research group that focuses on machine learning and other computer science topics.And while Bell Labs and others made huge contributions to basic, university-style research, X projects are conceived as moneymaking enterprises, or things that at least seem as if they could make money sometime in the next few years. With Foghorn, the goal was to turn seawater into gasoline for no more than $5 a gallon \u2014 enough that it could conceivably find a market in some European nations where high taxes make gasoline more costly.Kathy Cooper, an engineer who led the project, said of the goal, \u201cI think we could meet it, but it would be more like 15 to 20 years.\u201d That was too far away, which was why she recommended killing it.X employees avoid talking about money, but it is not a subject they can ignore. They face financial barriers that can shut down a project if it does not pan out as quickly as planned. And they have to meet various milestones before they can hire more people for their teams.The point, several executives said, is to encourage employees to think big while staying away from creating technology for technology\u2019s sake.\u201cIf you actually want to make the world better, focus on what would actually make the world better, and the technology will take care of itself,\u201d Mr. Teller said. In other words, great ideas that solve real problems will bring in real money.One of the more public examples was a recent overhaul of a Google robotics effort whose best-known project is a robotic cheetah. The division was recently dismantled, and its disparate technologies are being re-evaluated so they can either be sold off or streamlined for a specific moonshot idea, like \u201cbuild a car that can drive itself.\u201dOver the last year, X has hardened project milestones and created an intermediate step, called Foundry. The group\u2019s leader, Obi Felten, said her job was to hone new technologies into a concrete product and to work with engineers like Ms. Cooper to help them write business plans.The idea is to create a conveyor-belt-like process that encourages employees to quickly jettison projects that seem unlikely to work and to avoid technologies that are neat ideas but would never make money.One of the best ways to save money, Mr. Teller said, is to encourage employees to kill projects before they become expensive \u2014 hence the bonus for the Foghorn team. X staff meetings begin with a \u201cpremortem\u201d process in which people predict how various technologies might fall short. Employees\u2019 laptops are decorated with stickers of crumpled-up paper that represent the end of past efforts.When Mr. Teller speaks at events like South by Southwest and TED, he ruminates so deeply on the word \u201cfail\u201d that successes are sometimes framed as \u201cfailing to fail.\u201dThe idea of celebrating failure is a Silicon Valley clich\u00e9, but Mr. Teller talks about it in the practical terms of a management consultant. Say you have a team of 20 people working on a project that is not going anywhere, he said in a recent interview. In a year those 20 people will be 30 people. The company has to pay their salaries and health insurance, and the team will inevitably hire a few consultants. Worse, they will have wasted a year.How much money could the company save if you could get them to cut bait a year earlier?\u201cThat\u2019s the magic,\u201d Mr. Teller said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do it. They will not raise their hands and say, \u2018This project is just not what we should be working on,\u2019 unless you start bonusing them, unless they can get a promotion for ending their project.\u201dFailure bonuses are also an example of how X, which was set up independent of Google from the outset, is a leading indicator of sorts for how the autonomous Alphabet could work. In Alphabet, employees who do not work for Mother Google are supposed to have their financial futures tied to their own company instead of Google\u2019s search ads. At X, that means killing things before they become too expensive.Mr. Teller\u2019s decision to start paying bonuses to employees who kill their own projects happened long before the Alphabet transition, and it was met with skepticism from Google\u2019s chief culture officer. Mr. Teller got what he wanted anyway.\u201cThey were just offended by the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we don\u2019t even talk about it anymore.\u201dX was founded in 2010, and it was originally in a brick building on the edge of Google\u2019s main campus. At the beginning, it felt like an extended 20 percent project \u2014 the extra projects Google employees are encouraged to work on outside of their main job \u2014 with little in the way of process.Former Google employees said this led to a temptation to overhype projects long before they were ready. The most notorious example of this was Google Glass, the much maligned computer glasses.The glasses were supposed to have a marketing scheme to match, and X employees hatched an idea for floating showrooms. Later, when mysterious barges showed up in Portland, Me., and San Francisco Bay, they kicked off months of speculation and conspiracy theories until finally they were towed away without a word from Google.Mr. Teller said he shut down the barges idea the first day it was his decision to make. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of agonizing about that,\u201d he said.Today, the company\u2019s offices are a few miles from Google\u2019s main campus. They are full of electric vehicles and people riding skateboardlike contraptions. Mr. Teller appears to be always on Rollerblades.Beyond the main lobby and offices, behind key-card-protected doors, sit various labs, as well as an open warehouse floor that houses a division called the Design Kitchen, which appears to be a cross between a machine shop and a cool dad\u2019s garage. Some items spotted on a recent tour included climbing rope; lots of tools; oversize plugs; a set of skateboard wheels attached to a block, wires and a 9-volt battery; a plastic ear; and beer.Unlike Google, where software engineers are kings, X is run by an eclectic batch of scientists and tinkerers whose backgrounds range from math, physics and chemistry to design, fashion and public art. The line \u201cI\u2019m not an engineer\u201d seems to be a point of pride. Rich DeVaul, who heads a \u201crapid evaluation\u201d team whose job is to hatch and kill ideas in short order, guessed that fewer than half the employees have engineering degrees (he doesn\u2019t).\u201cI would argue that the great strength of X, in fact, is that basically we aren\u2019t just a bunch of techies,\u201d he said.The combination of big ideas, lofty rhetoric and a strict code of secrecy has made X a source of endless speculation and conspiracy theories. The one you hear most frequently, usually from competitors and venture capitalists, is that X is a giant public relations plan to distract regulators from Google\u2019s search business, which is under scrutiny around the world.Cynical though that sounds, it points to something that seems fundamentally true: Many of history\u2019s great corporate research efforts, like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, have come from companies that were monopolies or close to it.Failure bonuses notwithstanding, no normal person would walk away from X thinking it looked frugal. There is a free cafeteria whose recent menu included sushi and pork tri-tip. The bathrooms have Japanese toilet seats with buttons for warmth and spritz. Listening to X executives talk about saving money is a bit like having billionaires tell you they built a $30 million house for $30 million and not a penny more.But X\u2019s success will be less about money saved than the creation of a new Google-size business whose profits wash away all the losses. And while the division has already had some successes, it has yet to produce the \u201cmoonshot\u201d Mr. Teller is hoping for.Arguably the biggest success, Google Brain, is the one people know the least about. It was an artificial intelligence effort that was spun back into core Google in 2012 and is now embedded in products like voice search and the Google Photos app, in which users can search their albums for images like \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmountains.\u201dInvestors would prefer a shiny new business that does not rely on advertising. Mr. DeVaul hopes that if X can deliver a big hit, it will encourage other companies to copy the entire concept. Management science is a lot less interesting than moonshots, but until X hits the moon, that is what it is selling.\u201cWe could have five or 10 other world-class organizations doing this, and we would not be able to scratch the surface of the crazy big hard challenges out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist: I believe that there is an endless supply of huge problems affecting humanity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fully Self-Driving Car Is Still Years Away", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byEven as automakers and technology companies have been promoting a euphoric vision of the future in which cars will drive themselves and serious crashes will be rare, their engineers have been engaged in a sobering debate.Just how autonomous can and should cars become? the engineers are asking. Is there an inherent danger in technology that invites human drivers to sit back and relax \u2014 but still requires them to be ready to hit the brakes or grab the wheel at the first sign of trouble?Those questions have taken on a new urgency after the revelation this week that the driver of a Tesla Model S died in a crash in Florida while the electric car was operating in its Autopilot mode.The man, Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was driving on a divided highway, when a tractor-trailer truck made a left turn and crossed in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s lane of traffic. Tesla said neither Mr. Brown nor the car\u2019s self-driving system noticed the white truck against a bright sky, and the brakes were never applied.For now, other automakers are giving no sign of slowing down their efforts to push forward with cars that can drive themselves. But mainly they say the technology isn\u2019t ready yet \u2014 which for many is an implicit rebuke of Tesla\u2019s willingness to tempt tech-minded drivers to turn tomorrow\u2019s vision into today\u2019s road reality.On Friday, even as the world was absorbing news of Mr. Brown\u2019s death as the first known fatality of the autonomous driving revolution, the German automaker BMW said it intended to offer a \u201cself-driving car\u201d \u2014 but not until 2021. And it will have much different technology than is now available on the Tesla Model S.\u201cToday we are standing at the brink of a new revolution,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, BMW chief executive, said at a news conference in Munich.Mr. Kr\u00fcger added that the Tesla crash was \u201creally very sad\u201d and said BMW would need \u201cthe next few years\u201d to perfect its autonomous driving system. \u201cToday the technologies are not ready for serious production,\u201d he said.The world\u2019s largest carmaker, Toyota, is a notable holdout in the rush toward completely autonomous cars. Last year, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in a Silicon Valley-based research effort to focus on cars that will function as \u201cguardian angels,\u201d saving human drivers from errors, rather than replacing them.Tesla, which started its Autopilot feature last fall, has emphasized in discussing Mr. Brown\u2019s death that the system isn\u2019t intended to take over complete control of the car and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert and engaged.The point highlights the difference in approach that separates companies working on self-driving technology.Ford Motor, Google, Volvo and others are aiming at offering fully autonomous cars that can operate safely without human intervention at all \u2014 an approach engineers call Level 4 automated driving. Those companies are wary of semiautonomous, or Level 3, technology that can drive the car for stretches of road under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to be ready to take over.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is not even a fully fledged Level 3 technology, and some experts say it is a risky approach.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge inherent danger and it\u2019s well proven \u2014 the computer making a mistake and the driver not taking over quickly enough,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice.The trouble is that while semiautonomous systems like Tesla\u2019s are guiding a car, human drivers can be lulled into feeling they are able to turn their attention away from the road. Mr. Brown, like some other Model S owners, posted videos showing the driver with no hands on the steering wheel. In one video, a driver climbs into the back seat.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending machine company from Connellsville, Pa., owns a 2013 Model S that does not have Autopilot. But he drove a loaner with the feature earlier this year while his was being repaired. He loves his car and has deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when that car is available, yet he is \u201con the fence\u201d about getting Autopilot.While the technology \u201cwas the greatest thing\u201d on closed highways like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it could become confused in more complicated environments like construction zones, Mr. Cordaro said.\u201cMy experience is it\u2019s really not completely safe except in limited-access highways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives you a false sense of security. You get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel but you really can\u2019t. It should be called Auto-assist, instead of Autopilot, because that\u2019s all it is.\u201dEven Amnon Shashua, an executive whose technology is part of Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature, said on Friday that he did not think self-driving\u2019s time had yet come.Mobileye, along with the chip maker Intel, is at work in a partnership with BMW on the self-driving car that the German automaker described in Munich on Friday that is supposed to be available in 2021.Mr. Shashua suggested that self-driving technology was close, but still not quite ready for actual use without human drivers remaining engaged.\u201cFive years is a very short time,\u201d Mr. Shashua said. \u201cOn the other hand, it is a sufficient time to do the types of validations that are needed.\u201dThe BMW car Mobileye is collaborating on will be capable of piloting itself on highways, but not necessarily in complex urban settings.Automakers and technology companies still need to do \u201chundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers of validation and simulations\u201d in closed testing environments to be certain the technology is safe, Mr. Shashua said.\u201cI think it is very important, especially given this accident and what we hear in the news, that companies are very transparent about the limitations of the system,\u201d he said.Although Tesla has publicly said that it has enhanced the Mobileye technology, the company has not commented on whether it has enhanced the system to protect against what the industry describes as \u201clateral turn across path\u201d\u2014 the type of situation in the Florida accident.Others in the automotive industry are working on sensor technologies meant to detect vehicles from all angles.One approach is lidar \u2014 a system that uses rotating laser beams. Lidar is being used in the experimental autonomous vehicle being developed by BMW, as well as those by Google, Nissan and Apple. But it remains unclear whether the laser system will come down enough in price to use in mass-market cars.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World According to \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "FeatureThe show\u2019s creators have turned the travails of an anthropomorphic horse into a hilarious meditation on a peculiarly modern kind of unhappiness.Supported byThe first story described how Theodore Roosevelt handed the presidency to William Howard Taft. Displeased with Taft\u2019s performance, Roosevelt made a bid to regain the White House in 1912, which ended in a humiliating defeat. \u201cHe goes from being the most important person in the world to being a kind of fool,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. Roosevelt soon redeemed himself by embarking on a journey down a remote river in the Amazon. Eisner related Roosevelt\u2019s story to his own career: \u201cFor 40 years, I\u2019m the most important man in the room, and all of a sudden I thought the phone is never going to ring.\u201dWhich led him to his second parable of the evening, a tale about a figure somewhat less well known than the 26th president: the protagonist of an animated TV show that Eisner\u2019s production company, Tornante, had sold to Netflix. The show, \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d is about an anthropomorphic horse living in Los Angeles who suffers with existential, career and substance-abuse issues after the death of his sitcom.\u201cBoJack wants you to think he\u2019s still the most important person in the room,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. \u201cBut deep down, he knows he\u2019s not, and that is killing him.\u201d He tries to write his memoirs, but can\u2019t get started. Paparazzi birds torment him. He endures a withering mare of a mother and a Harvard-educated, name-dropping former writing partner named Cuddlywhiskers. He betrays everyone who tries to love him.The lesson for Bloomberg? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be sure you\u2019re not going to be embarrassed,\u201d Eisner said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t go dark.\u201dIt helps that \u201cBoJack\u201d is also funny. In the tradition of great melan-comedy predecessors like \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d and \u201cLouie,\u201d \u201cBoJack\u201d bites the hand that feeds it. Eisner claims the show is not just a Hollywood satire (\u201cNo one watches those\u201d), but it is centered on the travails of an actor for whom the trappings of success \u2014 money, a convertible, nubile fans \u2014 don\u2019t begin to make up for his has-been status.Superficially, the show is full of Sitcom 101 characters. There\u2019s the millennial wastrel Todd, who moved into BoJack\u2019s house, a modern monstrosity perched on a hill, five years ago and does nothing but eat breakfast cereal and smoke weed. There\u2019s Princess Carolyn, BoJack\u2019s ex/agent/sex buddy whom he disappoints not just romantically but also professionally, turning down every project she brings him. There\u2019s even a built-in frenemy, Mr. Peanutbutter, a yellow lab whose own former show, \u201cMr. Peanutbutter\u2019s House,\u201d was a rip-off of BoJack\u2019s long-running sitcom, \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around,\u201d in which he starred with three lovable orphans. But the characters on \u201cBoJack\u201d are deeper, and more complex, than those descriptions suggest. Todd, as his voice actor, Aaron Paul, says, may be \u201cthe first asexual character on television,\u201d and his loyalty to BoJack is often rewarded with heartbreaking indifference. Princess Carolyn is whip-smart, but her window to have kittens is closing; this she periodically regrets, blaming BoJack. And the more we watch Mr. Peanutbutter, the more apparent it is that, despite his career thievery, he\u2019s the simplest and most decent character on the show. All are at once infatuated with and repelled by BoJack.Still, for all this misanthropy and unremitting bleakness, BoJack retains our sympathy, especially as we see him wrestle with the damage inflicted by his twisted childhood. The offspring of a plow horse and a moody equine heiress to a sugar fortune, BoJack is raised primarily by network television, which he watches incessantly, even as his mother lectures him about how life is nothing but a pile of road apples. Like Sanders, BoJack just wants to be loved. The penultimate episode of the first season ends with BoJack\u2019s confronting the ghostwriter of his memoirs with an aching plea: \u201cI need you to tell me that I\u2019m a good person. ... Please, Diane, tell me that I\u2019m good.\u201d Before she can answer, a heckler interrupts, and the screen goes black.It\u2019s easy to assume that \u201cBoJack\u201d had its origins in the creative travails of 40-something television writers. But the idea actually sprang from the youthful angst of the show\u2019s creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg. Bob-Waksberg and his two younger sisters were raised in Palo Alto, Calif., by what he calls \u201ctwo professional Jews.\u201d His father helped Russian Jews emigrate from the Soviet Union; his mother owned a Jewish bookstore with his grandmother. He insists that his parents were the opposite of the stereotypically hard-charging Palo Alto parent \u2014 to whom some attributed the spate of suicides that have rocked Bob-Waksberg\u2019s high school in recent years \u2014 but he still struggled.He was repeatedly kicked out of class for being disruptive. When the principal refused to let him wear his beloved cycling cap in a school picture, he retaliated by shaving half his head on the quad. (He\u2019d already done the other half, which had given him a disturbing half-cherub-half-psycho look.) He missed field trips because he was sent to the principal\u2019s office so many times and ran with a group of \u201clike-minded weirdos,\u201d moving through the hallways with a frenetic, loud energy.There was a downside to his teenage charisma. Bob-Waksberg often pushed his jokes over the line, making his sister Becky and friends cry in frustration. \u201cI definitely have people who I went to high school with who would call me a bully,\u201d said Bob-Waksberg, who, at 31, still has the intense, spritelike energy of an adolescent. \u201cI would find something and tease them, which in my mind was harmless fun. And then they would go home and be like, Why is he so mean to me?\u201dAcademically, he floundered, but he sometimes won the lead in the school\u2019s theater productions, which led to his hanging out with a girl named Lisa Hanawalt, now the production designer and a producer on \u201cBoJack.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d riff on ideas for a TV show based on people we knew,\u201d Hanawalt remembers. \u201cWe\u2019d use that to make fun of them. Like, \u2018Oh, what if our friend was a pirate and he had a chicken on his shoulder instead of a parrot?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe two parted for college \u2014 Hanawalt, first, to U.C.L.A., then Bob-Waksberg to Bard \u2014 but stayed in touch, working on a comic via email. Within a decade, Hanawalt was a critically acclaimed illustrator and comics artist and Bob-Waksberg was making his way in Hollywood writing scripts, including one about three liars that morphed into a pilot about triplets. In 2010, he finally had an idea he really wanted to pursue, and he emailed Hanawalt.\u201cHey, do you have a picture of one of your horse guys, by himself? I came up with this idea for a show I\u2019d like to pitch. Tell me what you think: \u2018BoJack, the Depressed Talking Horse.\u2019\u2009\u201dAt first, Hanawalt thought the BoJack idea sounded sad and cynical, but she liked the horse part. As a kid, Hanawalt was so obsessed with horses that she sometimes walked on all fours. Her classmates called her Horse Poop and Lady Horse. After graduating from U.C.L.A., she cre\u00adated a comic book called \u201cExtra Egg Room\u201d about He-Horse, an anxiety-ridden horse. In another, she created She-Moose, an artist moose who lives with her boyfriend, a cat. She didn\u2019t draw on computers, so she did a series of watercolors of the main characters for \u201cBoJack.\u201d She advised Bob-Waksberg to make everything more animal-centric, suggesting that a Newton\u2019s Cradle in Princess Carolyn\u2019s office be strung with clanging mice instead of balls. BoJack\u2019s look came to her almost instantly \u2014 a mournful horse, too young to be wearing the Cosby sweaters he favors. She envisioned Diane as a bookish, Janeane Garofalo type. Hanawalt and her staff also provided many of the show\u2019s punning touches. Princess Carolyn\u2019s bookshelf includes the titles \u201cPurrity\u201d and \u201cPurrsepolis.\u201d Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s estate features a fire hydrant and countless portraits of dog butts and tennis balls.But BoJack still lives in a harsh realm. In the first five minutes of the first episode, he shows up drunk to a \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d interview and defends \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around.\u201d \u201cI think the show is actually pretty solid for what it is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not Ibsen, sure, but look \u2014 for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra. Sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes everything is going to turn out O.K.\u201dBob-Waksberg manages a staff of nearly 100, but he drives a silver Prius that Eisner gave him after it became clear he would never dump his beat-up Dodge. He is a slight man, who despite his biting humor still cries at Hallmark-card commercials; his blue eyes dart constantly, as if he\u2019s thinking three moves ahead. He and Arnett eventually got down to reading lines for a scene in which BoJack thinks he has nabbed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Secretariat in a biopic. BoJack should be ecstatic, but told of the nomination, he just mutters, \u201cI feel the same.\u201dArnett read the line a few times in BoJack\u2019s most-important-horse-in-the-room baritone before Bob-Waksberg interrupted.\u201cSay it disappointed and weirded out.\u201dArnett added a pause and a note of bewildered anguish.\u201cI feel ... the same.\u201dThey moved on to the next line, which Bob-Waksberg asked Arnett to do with \u201cmore bouncy energy. \u2018It\u2019s happening again. Jesus Christ, I\u2019ll never be happy. Typical me.\u2019\u2009\u201dArnett nods.\u201cIt\u2019s happening again. ... Why do I always think things will make me happy?\u201dBob-Waksberg jolted his head up. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dWhen Arnett finished recording, he told me that what drew him to BoJack was that the horse was kind of a jackass. \u201cI love a flawed character more than anything.\u201dSuddenly, an eager assistant bolted through the door. She wanted to make sure Arnett\u2019s lunch order had been taken.\u201cThat was so Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got interrupted having a real conversation and asked what we wanted for lunch.\u201d We talked about the show for a while before Arnett steered the conversation to the crushing nature of Hollywood. \u201cThe brass ring here is so shiny and so big, and the possibilities endless. So people come here because they want to be a star, whatever that means \u2014 that is the pinnacle. So when it doesn\u2019t happen, bad things tend to happen.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see myself having grandchildren with her,\u201d he replied, with BoJackian dourness.\u201cI love Raphael,\u201d Conover, who now has his own comedy show on TruTV, told me. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy being a Mr. Peanutbutter type, because having that BoJack mentality where you\u2019re constantly processing things can\u2019t be easy.\u201dBut this churning over the meaning of existence has always defined Bob-Waksberg\u2019s comedy. In Olde English, an absurdist comedy troupe he and Conover joined at Bard, Bob-Waksberg often played the role of a clueless yet self-righteous millennial. The group was successful and cutthroat; it would meet often to jettison members who weren\u2019t carrying their weight, with one member ordered to deliver the blow. \u201cThe ultimate pejorative was if you came up with something and someone else described it as corny,\u201d Bob-Waksberg says.After graduating, the Olde English crew migrated to New York and tried to develop ideas. Before calling it quits, they produced some co\u00admedic gems, including a film called \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d a twist on the Surrealists\u2019 parlor game. Each member wrote 15 pages of the script, but the next member saw only the last five. The result is a glorious mess of tone changes and character U-turns interspersed with snippets of commentary. Bob-Waksberg\u2019s section features a speech delivered from a Santa Monica beach days after he moved to Los Angeles. Wearing a tie, he wonders about the project before going global:\u201cHere\u2019s the problem with everything. As soon as you get something you want \u2014 it\u2019s no longer a thing you want, it\u2019s just a thing you have, and then you want the next thing. So I\u2019m starting to realize maybe I\u2019ll never be satisfied. ... I\u2019ll find the girl of my dreams, I\u2019ll get married and I\u2019ll have kids. Then, like a week later, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, this is [expletive].\u2019\u2009\u201dThen a heckler with a football jumps in the frame and ruins the take.The episode opens with scenes of Charlotte\u2019s domestic bliss. When BoJack arrives, he says he\u2019s in town for the Santa Fe boat show and \u2014 to make the lie believable \u2014 buys a yacht that he parks in the driveway. Bob-Waksberg asked an assistant to freeze the screen.\u201cWe knew things were going to break bad here, but the idea was he was going to sleep with Charlotte,\u201d he recalled. Then someone in the writers\u2019 room suggested that BoJack try to bed Penny instead. \u201cOnce that was said out loud, sleeping with Charlotte just felt so boring and expected,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that genie back in the bottle.\u201d I asked him if he polled any outsiders about whether a middle-aged depressive trying to sleep with a high-school senior was over the line. He thought for a second. \u201cA friend left her sweater here, and her assistant came to pick it up, and we asked if it was too much, and she said, \u2018No, I\u2019d go with it,\u2019 and that was it.\u201dAs the episode unfolds, BoJack takes Penny for driving lessons. He contemplates staying and teaching theater at a local college, but this idea is never mentioned again. (The subplot that goes nowhere is something of a Bob-Waksberg trademark.) BoJack magnanimously offers to drive Penny and some friends to the prom. He teaches them that they don\u2019t have to fit in, but then he gets one of them drunk and dumps her at the E.R. with alcohol poisoning. Still, Penny is having a magical evening and is the one to make the first move.\u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m ready, I have condoms in my room, and I know how to put one on with my mouth.\u201d\u201cLast stop for gas,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said, as we watched. \u201cThat\u2019s the last joke of the episode.\u201dBoJack brushes her off and finds Charlotte out back. He tries to talk her into abandoning her family for him. Charlotte tells BoJack he has to leave, not because she is angry but because he makes her too sad. \u201cYou think she says go because he\u2019s messing up her life,\u201d Bob-Waksberg told me. \u201cBut then she goes to this other, existential place \u2014 that\u2019s such a broader critique of BoJack.\u201dBoJack retreats to his boat and finds Penny waiting for him. The camera captures Penny loosening his tie when Charlotte walks in.\u201cIf you are not out of my driveway in 30 minutes, I will call the police. And if you ever try to contact me or my family again, I will [expletive] kill you.\u201d Freeze the frame and you have a still of modern parental horror. The next shot is of BoJack and his boat being towed back to Los Angeles.\u201cIn the writing of it, but then again in the animation of it, in the editing of it, we were really specific about what we were seeing,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said. \u201cOriginally Penny\u2019s top was down, and then it was like, No, that\u2019s too much. Let\u2019s reel back a little bit.\u201dI mentioned that despite the anguish of the episode you never see BoJack wrestle with the gravity of his actions \u2014 there\u2019s no classic moment of \u201cMy God, what have I done?\u201d\u201cWell, his whole life is one nervous breakdown,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said.Someone turned on the lights, and we walked into the studio where dozens of staff members were working. Bob-Waksberg shook his head. \u201cI need some sunlight.\u201dWhen I brought up his speech about the elusive pursuit of happiness in \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d he grimaced. \u201cI thought that was so cutting-edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was on top of my mind, and I still haven\u2019t gotten over that hill.\u201dA few years ago, someone posted on Craigs\u00adlist a missed connection that briefly went viral. A young man on a train spies a beautiful woman in glasses. Their eyes meet, but they say nothing, both missing their stops. This goes on for a very long time.\u201cFor months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of Skittles sold to us by kids raising money for their basketball teams. We must have heard a million mariachi bands, had our faces nearly kicked in by 100,000 break dancers. I gave money to the beggars until I ran out of singles. When the train went above\u00adground, I\u2019d get text messages and voice mails (\u2018Where are you? What happened? Are you O.K.?\u2019) until my phone ran out of battery.\u201dSixty years pass. There are meaningful glances, but the man says nothing. Finally, the now-elderly woman gets off the train; the now-old man stays on and never verbalizes his love.\u201cAnd I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for 60 years and yet still not really know that person at all. I stayed on the train until it got to Union Square, at which point I got off and transferred to the L.\u201dBob-Waksberg never took credit for the post, although it was eventually traced to him via an anonymous tip. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to just put art out there and watch and see what happens,\u201d he said over lunch at the observatory. He paused to shake the hand of a Dutch tourist who heard us talking about \u201cBoJack\u201d and came over to offer congratulations. \u201cAnd then it is gone. Things don\u2019t have to last forever.\u201dWe gathered our things and tossed them in the recycling. Bob-Waksberg turned to me to make one thing perfectly clear: He has a girlfriend.\u201cIt is going well.\u201dHe paused.\u201cI think.\u201dA few months later, he emailed me.\u201cCan I update that? Things with my girlfriend are going marvelously.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a blog post late on Wednesday, the electric carmaker\u2019s boss laid out his vision for the next decade or so. He has some compelling ideas: building more vehicle types and increasing autonomous-driving capabilities for a sharing economy. The trouble is that plenty of rivals want a piece of that business, too. And his missive fails to address several more immediate concerns \u2013 not least how to finance his ambitions.Mr. Musk titled his post \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux,\u201d \u2013 a reference to the \u201cSecret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\u201d that he wrote almost 10 years ago to the day. That detailed how he was building an electric sports car to raise money to manufacture family-friendly vehicles. He has largely succeeded, which lessens the conceit of drafting a new outline for the next decade.Unlike in 2006, though, Mr. Musk\u2019s ideas are now mainstream. Larger carmakers have caught on to the appeal of both electric and self-driving vehicles \u2013 as have the likes of Google and Apple. Everyone is grappling with the concept of people sharing private vehicles or using a taxilike fleet.Tesla may have an advantage in some areas. It is, after all, solely committed to electric and autonomous cars while traditional players still concentrate on gasoline engines. But Daimler, Ford, Toyota and others have deep pockets, whereas Tesla is still losing money and has to raise capital just to make sure it has the cash to develop its more affordable Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk\u2019s vision also includes electric passenger buses and heavy-duty trucks. Those are not just expensive propositions; they\u2019re also technologically tough at present as batteries powerful enough to propel them are not yet commercially viable.In the more immediate future, shareholders have another concern: Mr. Musk\u2019s desire to combine Tesla with SolarCity, his home solar panel company. The plan does nothing to allay fears about the motives for the tie-up or the governance issues it raises.Mr. Musk\u2019s determination to think far ahead is a positive and infectious antidote to short-term financial markets. But it is also a stark reminder that shareholders are not even riding shotgun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify and Apple Music: The Goth vs. the Stoner", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerIn this episode, we depart from the familiar letter-and-intervention format for a dive into the world of music streaming services. It is a topic that fascinates the Haggler, who can still barely fathom that for a mere $10 a month, he can get access to just about any musical recording on the planet.But which streaming app is the best? The Haggler has been mulling this question for a while, and after a lot of dabbling he regards Spotify as the gold standard. It is sturdy and remarkably fast; when you play a song from the cloud, it starts so quickly it seems to be waiting for you.The system is also easy to use. Streaming services, at least to the Haggler, are all about creating playlists \u2014 grabbing albums and songs and putting them in a place where you can find them quickly. That process is simple and intuitive on Spotify.If the system has a weakness, it is a less-than-lovely user interface, which is black and a Halloweenish shade of green \u2014 a little too goth for the Haggler\u2019s tastes. Far more important, it isn\u2019t great at introducing you to new albums and acts. It has features and algorithms designed to help you find undiscovered music, but they aren\u2019t compelling or visually appealing enough to be much help. The Haggler winds up listening to the same stuff over and over.This is why the Haggler has been rooting for Apple Music since an Android version of it was unveiled in November. The user interface is gorgeous \u2014 bright, airy and dominated by album art \u2014 and it is the finest new music introduction system ever created. It\u2019s like a professional matchmaker who never sleeps. It is always trying to find you something to love.But for all its upsides, Apple Music for iOS has been criticized for randomly deleting both songs and playlists. On Android, though, the app behaves even more weirdly. It took the Haggler a while to figure out what was happening. Then, a few weeks ago, it all became clear: Apple Music is stoned.Not dinner-party stoned, either. Apple Music is fried. It has the kind of \u201cWhere am I?\u201d buzz that should worry its friends. To wit: When the Haggler tries to turn an album into a playlist, only half the songs make the journey. Or all the songs make the journey but there are three copies of many. Or two copies. Sometimes, inexplicably, the songs are arranged alphabetically.\u201cHeh heh heh,\u201d says Apple Music, or so it seems to the Haggler\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019m really high right now.\u201dYou sure are! Just as bad, the system is supposed to learn what music you like, but no matter how many times the Haggler presses the \u201cI don\u2019t like this suggestion\u201d button on jazz albums, Apple Music keeps serving up Chet Baker and Bill Evans in a \u201cFor you\u201d list on the main menu. That\u2019s especially vexing because each time that button is pressed, up pops this message: \u201cGot it. We\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dBut Apple Music forgets. Do you know why? It\u2019s totally baked.When someone consumes this amount of weed, for so long, it\u2019s time for an intervention, and fortunately Apple Music just completed one. On July 8, the company updated the program, promising a fix for an assortment of bugs. A fix for the iOS version was released a few weeks ago.The Haggler doesn\u2019t own an iPhone, so he can\u2019t comment on whether it has improved, though the \u201cMy music has vanished!\u201d online complaints do seem to have died down. But he is happy to report that on his Android smartphone, the fixes work. Since the program update, playlists have been rationally sorted. No more triple copies, no more alphabetized albums.So is it time to ditch Spotify? Not so fast. Apple Music is still missing essential features. It doesn\u2019t let users make and share their own playlists, \u00e0 la Spotify, which is how the Haggler got to know every song from the HBO show \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d (Some fan of the show just made a compilation.) Apple Music also lacks crossfade, which allows the next song to fade in, over a customizable number of seconds, as the last song fades out. This is invaluable if you listen to music in part to block out the noise made by the rest of the universe.Also, while it\u2019s off recreational drugs, Apple Music is still balkier than Spotify, and is more likely to leave you staring at a spinning red line as it gathers its wits and looks for songs. And Apple Music has failed to streamline its playlist adding system. On Spotify, a playlist of Drake\u2019s album \u201cViews\u201d is automatically designated \u201cDrake \u2014 Views.\u201d On Apple Music, when you create a new playlist, it has no idea what to call it. The name is blank. So you have to type it yourself. This isn\u2019t exactly hard labor. But it adds to the sense that Apple Music needs more tweaks.The Haggler contacted Apple, but the company would not discuss whether any of these tweaks were coming, because it generally does not discuss future iterations of products.What\u2019s odd is that Apple is the user interface master of the world. If anything, you would expect it to take the bar established by Spotify and then leap over it. Instead, at least in a few crucial areas, it\u2019s lagging.Yet recently, after a few hours of rummaging around the \u201cRadio\u201d section of Apple Music \u2014 a bunch of shows curated by artists and D.J.s \u2014 the Haggler fell hard for a fantastic indie band from Oklahoma called Broncho and its song \u201cClass Historian.\u201d On Dr. Dre\u2019s radio station, the Pharmacy, he was reacquainted with A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cOh My God\u201d which he hadn\u2019t heard in years. The \u201cFor you\u201d list last week included an album of Beethoven\u2019s string trios that the Haggler will never again live without.If only someone could splice together the best parts of Apple Music and the best parts of Spotify, and then subtract each of their flaws. Unlikely, yes. But the Haggler can dream.EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT. Keep it family-friendly and under 250 words, include your hometown and go easy on the caps-lock key.

{"Headline": "Why Dieters Flock to Instagram", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byOn Instagram, devotees of a diet called the Whole30 have shared more than a million colorful photos of gluten-free, sugar-free, alcohol-free and dairy-free meals, and the occasional image of people showing off their bodies after 30 days of diet restrictions.The comments are heavy on exclamation points!\u201cBack on the salad grind today for lunch!\u201d\u201cReally excited about dinner!!!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re crushing this!!\u201dFor 30 days last summer, facing a demanding work schedule and lacking energy, I joined the flock.At first, I lurked on the hashtag, wondering if I could really spend 30 days whittling down my options for brunch, happy hours and dinners out, the activities that punctuate a workweek and make many of us feel connected.(I did not post a before-and-after photo. I have my limits.)I was adding to Instagram\u2019s engine of visual inspiration. The site is used by dieters as a modern version of sticking photos on the fridge, a support program without the hassle, public exposure or cost of joining a group in person. The Whole30 is one of seemingly endless like-minded communities that, for the most part, emphasize healthy living over weight loss.Melissa Hartwig, who has worked as a sports nutritionist and fitness instructor, cocreated the Whole30 program in 2009. A book, \u201cThe Whole30,\u201d was published last year and has sold more than 500,000 copies.\u201cNot only do you want to feel like you belong to something bigger than yourself,\u201d Ms. Hartwig, 42, said, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to stay connected so you have the accountability and motivation.\u201dThe scientists studied the frequency of online exchanges without looking at actual messages, but the members who were the most active with other members lost more weight, they found.The study found that Calorie King users who connected with 10 or more friends lost on average 8 percent of their body weight over six months, compared with an average of 5 percent weight loss among those who made between two and nine friends, and 4 percent for those who essentially \u201cwatched\u201d but did not participate socially on the site.While the most-connected users in the Calorie King study lost the most weight, it\u2019s notable that the less active users also lost a significant amount of weight. And losing even just 5 percent of your body weight improves your health, research shows.Dr. Spring said the urge for privacy was found in a 2012 study by the Northwestern group, in which 96 people were given access to a chat application that encouraged a weight-loss competition. Researchers found that most of the people in the study did not want to share stories of weight loss. The few people who tried to do so were ignored or insulted by other group members.In a more recent test by the Northwestern researchers, 300 college students were asked to join a private Facebook group. That group is interacting with reading materials, but they\u2019re still afraid of being \u201cthat person\u201d who jumps in and shares their story, Dr. Spring said.Dr. Spring said that Instagram may have success as a dieting platform because it is actually \u201ca little bit less socially connected\u201d than other platforms, serving the online dieters who value privacy and want minimal interaction with others.\u201cSome people feel highly motivated and egged on to succeed when they can post their accomplishments on a leader board and compare their progress to others\u2019,\u201d Dr. Spring said. \u201cOthers cave under that kind of pressure and public scrutiny.\u201dI fell into the latter category. When I was plugged into the Whole30, I found that Instagram could be a cheap way to keep myself motivated without trumpeting my journey to the world.\u201cSocial media accounts have a tendency to promote everything as being perfect and rosy,\u201d she said, \u201cThat stress can and does offset the benefits from the healthier lifestyle they are trying to create.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If Niantic had pitched Pok\u00e9mon Go two years earlier, he said, \u201cNintendo wouldn\u2019t have just said no, they wouldn\u2019t even have listened.\u201dA Nintendo spokesman declined to comment.Nintendo has shown before that it can adapt. It got its start making playing cards in 1889. By the 1970s it was designing video games, leading to the release of the Donkey Kong video game machine in 1981.Many of its ideas offered a glimpse into the future of video games. In 1983, it added a modem port to the home video game console that would eventually become the popular Nintendo Entertainment System, decades ahead of a time when Xbox and PlayStation gamers connect with one another around the world.\u201cThey were pushing the envelope so much earlier than anyone realizes,\u201d said Jeff Ryan, author of the book \u201cSuper Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America.\u201dNintendo was still riding high on the success of its video game consoles in 1998 when it released the first Pok\u00e9mon hand-held video game in America. Based on the childhood bug collecting passion of its creator, Satoshi Tajiri, it let players seek out and collect Pok\u00e9mon, then train them into powerful warriors.Nintendo assumed Pok\u00e9mon would not catch on in America: \u201cIt was role-playing, with minimal graphics, battles that ended with one fighter \u2018fainting\u2019 instead of dying, and an obsessive compulsive goal of finding 150 critters wandering in the woods,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote.But it also had cutting-edge innovations. Players could connect their Game Boys with a cable to battle each other, foreshadowing today\u2019s connected mobile games. It was also an early example of what the gaming industry would come to call casual games: Games that can be put down and picked up again whenever the user likes.Many games of the era had an end, like a big villain to defeat, that players could race to if they focused on the game for hours or days. Even after collecting all the Pok\u00e9mon and defeating increasingly powerful opponents, a player could keep playing and battling friends.Smartphones seemed like a natural fit for Pok\u00e9mon when they emerged more than a decade later. The Pok\u00e9mon Company, which owns the Pok\u00e9mon characters and is partially owned by Nintendo, released a free app game to promote the trading cards in 2011. But Nintendo said it would not sell games on any app stores.Nintendo was at a crossroads in other ways. In 2013, its longtime president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, died. Last year, Satoru Iwata, a former Nintendo chief executive and a game designer who supported the Pok\u00e9mon Go project, also died.Pok\u00e9mon Go demonstrates that Nintendo\u2019s stable of characters \u2014 which also includes the mustachioed plumber Mario, a princess named Zelda, and her savior, Link \u2014 can form the basis for others to develop lucrative mobile games. But that would turn Nintendo into a different kind of company \u2014 one, Mr. Ryan says, that is content to hit singles and doubles rather than swing for the fences.\u201cIt would make them a ton of money and it would secure their reputation for 100 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would also not make them Nintendo anymore.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jonathan Soble from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chasing Pok\u00e9mon, a Baby Step Toward Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In this season of random assassinations and political uproar, who could resist the temptation to supplement a high-strung and frightening reality with some gentle make-believe?It is, in essence, digitally enhanced bird-watching: Find fantastic creatures like Weedle and Golbat in the wild, collect as many as possible, and get personal satisfaction and bragging rights from doing so.To answer that question, I downloaded the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, which involved giving up my rights to trial by jury, agreeing that my content could be the game\u2019s content but the game\u2019s content would never be my content, and stating I was not on the United States government\u2019s list of prohibited or restricted parties. There were also many other clauses I didn\u2019t bother to read.Then I charged my phone and proceeded to Dolores Park, a deeply green expanse in the center of the city that was the site of San Francisco\u2019s first large planned Pok\u00e9mon Go event on Wednesday.It was 69 degrees, a perfect summer evening. The app told me I was passing the place where the poet Robert Frost was born. A plaque marked the spot, which was a location in the game. Pok\u00e9mon quoted Frost:Such was life in the Golden Gate:Gold dusted all we drank and ate,And I was one of the children told,\u201cWe all must eat our peck of gold.\u201dThis was a promising omen, Pok\u00e9mon telling me interesting things I never knew about a locale steps from my office. In the park, people spread languidly, smoking dope and playing with their dogs, not a care in the world. Slowly a group congregated near a statue of Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican independence. It was nearly all young and overwhelmingly white. In other words, it looked like Silicon Valley \u2014 although with a greater female presence.Everyone stared down at their phones, catching the creatures that the app superimposed on the landscape. Aaron Orcino was drinking a can of beer he had brought along. The appeal, he said, \u201cwas the randomness. You don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\u201dBut surely he had other excellent options for an evening\u2019s entertainment?\u201cNo, this is the best thing,\u201d he said.He was kidding, a bit. Mr. Orcino works at Facebook, and so at least some of his interest was professional. \u201cI am studying it, learning the dynamics,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see how long people can continue playing before Pok\u00e9mon has to introduce a new game play element\u201d \u2014 up the stakes, in other words.Fifty years ago, the F.B.I., worried that the youth of America might foment revolution, would infiltrate San Francisco demonstrations. Now the tech companies are doing the monitoring, wondering if games like Pok\u00e9mon represent a threat that must be neutralized or an opportunity to be exploited. That\u2019s progress for you.For what seemed like a long time, it wasn\u2019t clear if anything would actually happen in the park. Television journalists did interviews. Haagen-Dazs distributed free ice cream. Less than three weeks old, Pok\u00e9mon Go was fulfilling its destiny as a marketing and media opportunity.Finally we set off, perhaps 200 of us. A larger and somewhat more diverse crowd, maybe 600 or so, departed from the opposite terminus, the Ferry Building, and marched in our direction. Like just about everything else involving new technology, the size of the projected crowd had been seriously overhyped.We walked, collecting Pok\u00e9mon along the way. Sergio Gonzalez was carrying a bottle of Veuve Cliquot Champagne, which he generously shared. \u201cThis is my childhood coming into fruition,\u201d said Mr. Gonzalez, a sommelier who was 9 in 1996 when the original Pok\u00e9mon debuted. \u201cI\u2019m reconnecting with my generation.\u201dHe turned to the woman he was walking with. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to hang out, let\u2019s be formally introduced,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Sergio.\u201dI read an email from Michael Saler, the author of \u201cAs If: Modern Enchantment and the Literary Prehistory of Virtual Reality\u201d and an expert on the augmented life that technology companies are creating for us.He was guardedly optimistic. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go is making everything new again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the enticement of the hunt, but coming across other people doing the same thing. These apps are going from pure fantasy games to helping us appreciate reality a bit more. It shows that nature and fantasy aren\u2019t opposites, that they can come together.\u201dMr. Saler added: \u201cWe always think of these innovations as a new heaven on Earth or the ninth level of hell. But it\u2019s never one or the other, there are always disadvantages and advantages.\u201dInstead, there was widespread enthusiasm for getting people outdoors by any means possible. People on our trek agreed this was little short of a miracle.\u201cIf you had told me a week ago I should go outside, I would have said, What?\u201d said Anton, a programmer who declined to give his last name. He said he now played Pok\u00e9mon Go for hours at a time, running in parks to collect the animals.That\u2019s one way to look at it. Another, of course, is that the game tethers people even more firmly to their devices in the one place they used to be able to at least partly escape from them: outdoors. On the Pok\u00e9mon Crawl Survival Kit, posted on the Facebook page, among the items to bring was a \u201cphone charger and portable charge.\u201d Many did, their phone cables disappearing into their backpacks.I tried to take the train home to the East Bay, but something was obstructing the track. BART, perpetually overcrowded and frequently overwhelmed, said there would be no trans-bay service, perhaps for hours. It recommended a trans-bay bus but, in the crowd-counting spirit of Silicon Valley, I\u2019d estimate there were at least 9,000 people at the terminal.There was nothing to do but summon Uber, which informed me that surge pricing was in effect and that normal fares would be somewhere between double and triple. My usual $5 trip home cost $76. Another peck of gold for Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An App to Deconstruct Your Food", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Ever wondered how long you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to swim to burn off the calories in an organic peanut butter cup? Or how far the strawberries or burger on your plate traveled to get there?\u00e2\u0080\u009cFood labels are a data visualization that we see every day, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a lot from them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sam Slover, the co-founder and chief executive of Sage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of things about those labels that make assumptions about what you know and what you want to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDo we really need another food app? Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s app store already lists more than three dozen apps offering users information and advice about calories, nutrition data and weight loss, but research shows that many consumers have a failed relationship with their food apps. For instance, in January, about 16 percent of the people who downloaded the Lose It app were using it once a day. By June, only 10 percent were using it that often, according to research firm 7Park Data.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese apps have trouble keeping customers loyal \u2014 if you use them successfully, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need them any more, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use them successfully, you may not think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth it to try more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Byrne Hobart, the lead analyst at 7Park Data. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of like the dating apps that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Sage app hopes to inspire more loyalty by providing a trove of useful and quirky information about the food you eat. It contains data on about 20,000 products, though you still may not find your favorite junk foods. Most of the products in the database are described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009corganic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But if you shop at Whole Foods, you\u2019re in luck. Sage has partnered with Whole Foods Market, deconstructing all of the roughly 7,000 items sold in the grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new \u201c365\u201d store chains in Los Angeles and Lake Oswego, Ore.To begin using Sage, which is available online or as a web-based app, a user signs up and enters any food restrictions and personal preferences. Only want to see products without additives and preservatives? No problem. Interested in digestive health? Sage will comb through its database and show you products with probiotics, high fiber and whole grains.The app displays a wide variety of information using colorful graphics and animated food characters, and it\u2019s surprisingly fun and entertaining to use. The app told me that Surf Sweet gummy bears, for instance, do have a fair amount of added sugar but also have \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood nutrient density,\u201d meaning that, among other things, they supply a high amount of vitamin C (much to my delight). A jump-roping chocolate bar informs me that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to jump rope for 19 minutes \u2014 or a snorkeling olive recommends 23 minutes of swimming \u2014  to burn off a serving of Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Organic milk chocolate peanut butter cups. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCustomers want a better understanding of how a product is sourced, the quality standards behind it, whether the labor that made it was paid a fair wage, its impact on the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jason Buechel, the chief information officer at Whole Foods. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a way to give them all that information that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t captured on the nutrition label.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTake the Beast Burger, for instance, a meatless burger sold at Whole Foods. Type the name of the burger into Sage or flip through a list, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find its basic nutritional profile and calorie content, with highlights of its nutritional strengths.Using animated food characters \u2014 a pear doing yoga, a watermelon riding a bike \u2014\u00c2\u00a0the app shows how much exercise would be required to work off the burger. In my case, it\u2019s 20 minutes of running, 22 minutes of jumping rope, 28 minutes of swimming or biking, 44 minutes of dance or 89 minutes of yoga.Sage also identifies any allergens \u2014 corn and seeds in the case of the Beast Burger \u2014 and offers detailed explanations of all the burger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ingredients, and why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used should you be interested. For instance: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalcium chloride, a salt, is used in canned goods to improve stability and quality and as a firming agent in tofu production.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe system awards \u00e2\u0080\u009cbadges\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the burger for things like an abundance of healthy fats and protein and having recyclable packaging, and it explains what diets \u2014 dairy free, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and ketogenic \u2014 it does not violate. To make nutrition recommendations like \u201cfiber friendly\u201d or \u201cheart healthy,\u201d Sage uses nutritional standards set by the Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association. An in-house team of dietitians and nutritionists have created standards for badges like \u201chealthy fats\u201d or \u201ccontains probiotics\u201d \u2014 areas where the F.D.A. doesn\u2019t set guidelines.Finally, the app tells you where the product is made or sourced. The Beast Burger is American made. If you decided to check out Driscoll strawberries, you might learn your batch came from Mexico. It also can tailor daily nutritional requirements to a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specific weight, height and lifestyle. For instance, Sage came up with a recommended daily caloric intake of about 3,300 calories that is rich in protein for Mr. Slover, given his height, weight and exercise routine \u2014 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a triathlete. It recommended a 1,600-calorie diet with a lower portion of protein for his mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll those things on a label telling you that a product gives you, say, 10 percent of the daily requirement of protein is based on a default, 2,000-calorie-day diet, a kind of one-size-fits-all approach that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Slover said.One thing the Sage app won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you is what you should or shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat. You will have to figure that out for yourself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a big fan of red, yellow and green scoring mechanisms for food,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Slover said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well received by consumers or used very much.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Joshua Brown, Who Died in Self-Driving Accident, Tested Limits of His Tesla", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byCANTON, Ohio \u2014 Joshua Brown loved his all-electric Tesla Model S so much he nicknamed it Tessy.And he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving hands-free. In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45,000 miles on the car.\u201cI do drive it a LOT,\u201d he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen Tesla-themed videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion.They also tend to be people who like to live on technology\u2019s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown\u2019s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a 3-D printer to make model tanks and trucks.His Tesla, in other words, was simply one more extension of his technology-driven life. It took him on far-flung adventures from the gravel driveway of the pale-blue clapboard house where he lived alone in Canton, an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland.The driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.\u201cHe liked it mainly because it was an exceptional use of technology, and Josh was very much an innovator,\u201d said his friend Paul Snow, who recalled how excited Mr. Brown was about his Tesla during a recent road trip. \u201cHe enjoyed the fact that technology was available, that it was being used to, ironically, increase safety on the roads.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s most recent video was his most popular. Titled \u201cAutopilot Saves Model S,\u201d it shows Mr. Brown driving on an interstate highway from Cleveland to Canton. A white truck cuts in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle, and by his account, the Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature swerves the car to the right, avoiding a collision.After Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s founder, called attention to the video on Twitter, it went viral.Mr. Brown seemed to be elated.\u201cHe had said, \u2018For something to catch Elon Musk\u2019s eye, I can die and go to heaven now,\u2019\u201d said a neighbor, Krista Kitchen, choking up. \u201cHe was absolutely thrilled \u2013 and then a couple weeks later he died.\u201dMs. Kitchen said Mr. Brown, 40, had just left a family trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando. His relatives did not respond to requests for comment. At Mr. Brown\u2019s house, behind an expansive, well-trimmed lawn, a man who answered the door on Friday said the family did not wish to speak to reporters.Ms. Kitchen and others described how Mr. Brown would eagerly share his Tesla with friends, letting them take turns behind the wheel. And they described a man who was broadly generous with his time, who consistently helped friends in need, and who stayed in touch with his fellow veterans.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cHe was certainly an adventurer,\u201d Mr. Snow said. \u201cHe was a warrior that served proudly for his country; he was a patriot. He did many things that had never been done before.\u201dMr. Brown was particularly interested in testing the limits of the Autopilot function, documenting how the vehicle would react in blind spots, going around curves and other more challenging situations.\u201cThis section in here is going to be very, very difficult for the car to handle,\u201d he said in one video, posted in October, as his vehicle rounded a curve. \u201cWe\u2019re filming this just so you can see scenarios where the car does not do well.\u201dMark Vernon, a high school classmate who recalled tinkering with electronics in shop class together, said that his friend showed off the self-driving feature on a recent visit at Mr. Brown\u2019s home.\u201cHe knew the hill that it would give up on, because it couldn\u2019t see far enough,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cHe knew all the limitations that it would find and he really knew how it was supposed to work.\u201dMr. Brown attended the University of New Mexico, where he studied physics and computer science, but did not graduate, the school said. Instead, he joined the Navy, where he served for more than a decade and specialized in disarming explosives, according to his company\u2019s website.His service included a stint with the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team 6. Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said he had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree.\u201dTesla owners tend to share a love of technology, and an eagerness to embrace the unknown, the untested or the unproven. Photos posted on Mr. Brown\u2019s Facebook page show a love of the outdoors, where he rappelled down cliffs and jumped out of airplanes for fun.\u201cHe\u2019d probably fly an F-18 to test-drive it,\u201d she said, referring to the military fighter jet.Tesla enthusiasts often also share a loyalty to the company, much the way Apple has engendered true believers whom it relies on to back the introduction of new iPhones, Macs and other products.Richard Henry, 26, who bought a 2015 Model S about nine months ago, uses Autopilot to take him through about 40 miles of freeway driving on each leg of his commute between San Francisco and Mountain View.When he started using his car\u2019s Autopilot mode, it had a tendency to lose track of the highway lines and tell him to take control. But in the last few months it has improved more and more. Most days he turns it on and sits with his hands on his knees \u2014 ready to take the wheel, he pointed out.Learning about the technology and getting used to it has been \u201csuperfun,\u201d he said. That is a point that separates him from the many other drivers who tend to learn how to use a few necessary functions in their car and never bother with most others. \u201cI really like trying stuff like this out and understanding how the technology works,\u201d Mr. Henry said.Mr. Brown\u2019s enthusiasm for technology factored deeply into his work at Nexu, which specialized in setting up internet access in rural areas of the country where forests and mountains created special obstacles to entering the connected world.\u201cThe big companies wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d Ms. Staneski said, adding that Mr. Brown had become a mentor to her son. \u201cIt was too difficult, or they just wanted to charge you an extreme amount of money, whereas Josh felt that we deserved a chance that everybody else had.\u201dRachel Abrams reported from Canton, Ohio, and Annalyn Kurtz from New York.

{"Headline": "Reasons to Believe the A.I. Boom Is Real", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byBitsArtificial intelligence is booming. But why now?The movement can be thought of as a spread of computing intelligence everywhere, on wheels and wings, in your pocket and all through your house. That\u2019s a big enough idea to fund scores of companies, and quite possibly set up the next Silicon Valley boom. And bubble.Yet it\u2019s worth asking how much of this is reality and how much is wishful thinking. Why is A.I. growing the way it didn\u2019t over the last several decades, despite promises that it would?The answer to that lies in the precursors to this A.I. moment, which more than anything has to do with the Google-led search boom 10 years ago.In 2006, Google and Yahoo released new methods of analyzing the quirky real-world data they were picking up from doing search. Data from browsers can be thought of as a proxy for human behavior, as people wander the web. It\u2019s typically called \u201cunstructured\u201d data, as opposed to the more regular information of things like banking and airline schedules that filled most of the world\u2019s databases.That new way of seeing the real world helped make search profitable and also enabled companies like Facebook to look into even stranger social behavior. The success also gave these companies plenty of money to plow into the problem.To money, and the first ever caches of natural behavior in digital form, add cheaper computing. In 2006, Amazon also introduced its cloud-computing business. Over the last decade, retail cloud computing has become an inexpensive way for lots of people to work on data analysis and pattern finding, the heart of A.I.Only one more thing was needed, and in 2007 Apple came out with the iPhone. Let that stand for browser-type natural data collection moving off desktops and blowing through the natural world. Along with other cheap sensors tied to the cloud, it has given us huge amounts of data about all sorts of things.That created many more places where computers could do what they\u2019ve always done, which is to seek efficiency. That has created a cycle:more observation, more machine learning of patterns, more value capture funding more observation.It\u2019s enough to make you believe in this boom.What could make you believe it\u2019s also a bubble? Start with the name, artificial intelligence. So far there is zero evidence we will be about to build machines that possess intelligence or will really think on their own. If big money goes into that stuff, run for the hills.Advertisement"}

Google could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe\u2019s tough competition rules.Google said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide a detailed response to Europe\u2019s latest charges, but it added, \u201cWe believe our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for E.U. consumers and promote competition.\u201d The company has until the fall to respond.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Europe\u2019s new antitrust charges represent a further ratcheting up of the region\u2019s often frosty relationship with Google.In particular, European antitrust officials are taking aim at some of the company\u2019s online advertising tools \u2014 the main engine for Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue. They say that the company may have abused its dominant market position when offering some of its search products on third-party companies\u2019 websites.These businesses \u2014 including publishers and online retailers \u2014 can use Google\u2019s search engine on their sites so that people can find information like newspaper articles or promotions. Such agreements with third-party companies, which date to 2006, also include showing paid-for advertising next to search results, often provided by Google.Ms. Vestager said on Thursday that the technology company may have abused its dominance \u2014 it holds roughly an 80 percent market share in this type of niche on-site search \u2014 by forcing companies to sign onerous contracts that limited competition and reduced consumer choice.Since 2009, Google has made it easier for advertising rivals to show their offerings alongside its services. But Europe\u2019s competition chief said that Google still required third-party companies to show a minimum number of Google-provided ads on their site. The Silicon Valley company also requires businesses using the service to ask for approval on where some rivals\u2019 ads may be shown on their websites.\u201cAll these restrictions allowed Google to protect its market share and stifle competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Europe\u2019s antitrust authorities have also doubled down on a previous competition charge, announced last year, which claimed that Google had diverted traffic from competitors in favor of its own comparison-shopping site. On Thursday, Ms. Vestager said her team had found new evidence to buttress their claims, adding that because of Google\u2019s actions, European consumers may not have access to the most relevant search results when looking online for goods and services.Yet when asked about the failure of European antitrust authorities to order fines or changes to the way Google does business, despite several years of investigations, Ms. Vestager said she aimed to ensure the charges against the company stood up in European courts.\u201cSpeed is of the essence,\u201d but \u201cthe other side of that coin is quality,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Thursday. \u201cSometimes that kind of quality comes at the cost of speed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Didi Chuxing and Uber, Popular in China, Are Now Legal, Too", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Ride-hailing services in China have attracted billions of dollars in investments. They have pulled in money from some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, like Apple and Alibaba. They have become a crucial road test for one of America\u2019s best-known start-ups, Uber.On Thursday, they finally became legal.In a new law announced by several regulators, China\u2019s government gave the thumbs-up for ride-hailing companies like Uber and its Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, to operate in the country. The law clears up regulatory uncertainty and lays out a new framework under which ride-hailing companies can operate in the country.Uber and Didi have upended China\u2019s taxi industry by allowing drivers to take passengers in private vehicles with the help of hugely popular apps. Despite investments in technology, marketing and subsidies, both companies had operated in a legal gray zone, with drivers occasionally being detained by the police.Strict government rules have repeatedly tripped up local and foreign internet companies in China. Yet in the fast-moving Chinese tech industry, an \u201cinvest first, get approval later\u201d model has prevailed. For Uber and Didi, it appears that ethos has paid off.Analysts said the new law, which will take effect on Nov. 1, signaled a step back from earlier, stricter proposals. According to the rules, drivers must have three years\u2019 experience, be licensed by a local taxi regulator and have no criminal record. Cars with more than 600,000 kilometers, or about 370,000 miles, on the odometer may not be used.Drivers were divided on what to make of the new rules. On one hand, they said in a chat group, it was a relief to see their job permitted by the government. On the other hand, the finer points of the law were unclear, leaving open questions like whether cars licensed outside Beijing would be allowed to take fares in the city.In an interview, a 31-year-old driver with the surname Liu, who did not give his full name because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the ride-hailing services, pointed out that the law did not address other concerns; many drivers have seen incomes cut nearly in half recently as Didi and Uber have reduced subsidies.That has been more painful to drivers who bought cars to take advantage of the big bonuses that had been offered. One man, Wen Zhenjiang, 37, quit a job driving Coca-Cola trucks from Beijing to the western city of Xi\u2019an and bought a Volkswagen to start driving for Uber and Didi.\u201cI will see how much I can earn,\u201d Mr. Wen said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t earn much, even if it\u2019s legal now, there\u2019s no point in doing it.\u201dHe added that he thought many drivers would fail the licensing process and that he was wary of the GPS tracking devices the new law says must be installed on their vehicles as a safety measure. Similar devices have led to limits on how much time drivers can spend on the road in trucking, he said.\u201cI know the tracking devices,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you install that and drive more than eight hours a day, you will be fined, and your company won\u2019t pay the fine.\u201dExperts said there was nothing in the law to validate Mr. Wen\u2019s concerns.Uber and Didi issued statements welcoming the regulation. In a note from the senior vice president of corporate development for Uber\u2019s Chinese arm, Zhen Liu, the company said it was \u201cregulation-ready\u201d and would be working with local authorities to put the regulations into practice.Didi said its drivers would begin applying for local licenses. Didi\u2019s statement praised elements of the rules, like the fact that ride-hailing companies will be allowed to set their own prices.Calling the new law a \u201cmilestone\u201d for China\u2019s sharing economy, Wu Shenkuo, a Beijing Normal University law professor, said he did not see any evidence that the law would specifically take aim at foreign companies. Still, he said, the companies must take care to comply with the rules, which will be put in place locally.\u201cCompanies need to adjust to the new law, especially in terms of applying for licenses, screening drivers and equipping cars,\u201d he said, adding that the law creates a model as China seeks to regulate new internet-based industries that conflict with existing businesses. Taxi drivers in China have held mass protests over ride-hailing apps, which they say are unfair competition.\u201cFrom what I can see now, it is very likely that companies will give out less subsidies, raise the rate up for car-hailing, and as a consequence, there might be fewer part-time drivers,\u201d he added.While Uber remains in the middle of a brutal pricing competition with Didi, which has more of the market, the rules to some degree validate the American company\u2019s willingness to flout regulations in new markets.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Yet there can be some benefits to upgrading now.If you are hopping on the early-upgrade train for iOS, here are some tips for making the experience smoother and for avoiding disaster.After enrolling, you will receive an email with steps on installing the upgrade.Before installing the upgrade, it is crucial to back up your device data in case something goes wrong. Apple recommends backing up your iPhone or iPad over a wired connection to a computer running the latest version of its iTunes software. After opening iTunes, select your Apple device and hit the Back Up Now button to create a backup on the computer.For now, a new Messages app, which lets you send drawings and animations to other iOS 10 users, will be the biggest change. Apple also made its Photos app smarter \u2014 a feature called Memories will automatically compile multiple photos from an occasion, like your trip to Spain, into video montages. You can also test Apple\u2019s redesigned apps for music, maps and news.A bonus for iPhone 6S or 6S Plus owners is they can use 3D Touch, the feature that triggers different actions based on how hard you press the touch screen, to try some new tricks in iOS 10. When sending a text message, pressing harder on the send arrow opens a menu where you can select an animation to embed, like neon lasers or birthday balloons. Also, when a text-message notification pops up on the iPhone\u2019s lock screen, you can use 3D Touch to press down on the notification and reply to the message without logging in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Payday Options for Making Ends Meet", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byFor decades, most American companies have paid their workers once every week or two, minimizing the administrative costs of frequent paydays and maximizing the interest the companies earn by keeping the money in the bank.And for equally long, workers have complained about the unfairness of waiting for their paychecks.But now, thanks in part to the gig economy, a small but growing number of employers and start-ups are testing ways to give employees faster access to their wages. A variety of options \u2014 some involving payroll cards, and others using A.T.M.s and other methods \u2014 have recently hit the market, permitting people to take home their pay as soon as they have earned it.On one hand, this could be good news for people who live from paycheck to paycheck. If the trend catches on, it could reduce the demand for products like payday loans, which workers use when they run short of money, but which charge very high interest rates. On the other hand, the services that are providing on-demand wages charge fees every time a worker uses them, so there is a trade-off.From the employer\u2019s perspective, instant payment for a day\u2019s work has the potential to motivate employees to work longer hours \u2014 after all, instant financial gratification is a powerful productivity incentive.But gig services are a niche part of the job market. Fast cash has long been a perk for waiters, bartenders and other tipped workers. Most Americans draw their paychecks from companies with more rigid financial systems. In that market, there has been little incentive for change \u2014 until recently.Michael Fox, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he was initially skeptical but became a convert when he saw what a big difference the option made for some workers.\u201cWhen you have people living on the edge, very small things can cause a rapid acceleration into very bad conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just $60 or $90 short, and can\u2019t make a rent payment or buy medicine, it spirals. One little thing creates a huge disaster.\u201dPayActiv\u2019s founder, Safwan Shah, talks with a missionary zeal about the potential impact. \u201cThe biggest bank in this country is the bank of the employer, and two to three weeks of salary for most people is stuck there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a corporate responsibility issue.\u201dGetting employers to view it that way, though, is an extremely hard sell. Frank Dombroski knows. He has been making the pitch for five years and is only just starting to see signs of momentum.\u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a struggle, but we kind of knew that going in,\u201d he said.He thinks the tide is starting to turn. A new partnership with ADP, a big provider of payroll services, has helped FlexWage get on the radar of bigger businesses. The company says it is finalizing deals with two employers that would double the 8,000 people currently using its system.\u201cThere\u2019s been so much attention to the high cost of short-term lending, like bank overdraft fees and payday loans, that employers understand a lot more clearly now the dire need,\u201d Mr. Dombroski said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them that there\u2019s a problem any longer. Now we need to convince them there\u2019s a solution.\u201dLike almost all fast-cash borrowing options, the services have fees that can be steeper than alternatives like credit cards. Activehours has a hippie-ish \u201cpay what you think it\u2019s worth\u201d fee structure, but FlexWage and PayActiv charge rates that typically cost $3 to $5 per transaction. A worker who pays $3 to withdraw $100 a week before payday is effectively paying an annual percentage rate of 156 percent for the money.But those costs still tend to be lower than those of bank overdrafts, payday loans and other emergency lending sources. Eric Zsadanyi, a forklift driver at Goodwill, has been using PayActiv advances almost monthly to pay his rent, which consumes more than one of his biweekly paychecks. He is usually only $50 or $100 short, but if his rent isn\u2019t on time, he owes a $50 late fee.Mr. Zsadanyi keeps his withdrawals low so that his next check won\u2019t shrink more than he can afford. Knowing that in a bind he can get cash for rent or groceries is a relief, he said.Factories, hospitals, call centers and other employers with large numbers of variable-hour employees have been among the most receptive to the idea, according to executives at PayActiv and FlexWage. Especially in industries with thin margins, companies are willing to consider new ways to relieve financial strains on their employees \u2014 without actually paying them more money.Still, the biweekly payday is a ritual most companies don\u2019t want to disturb. The regularity with which clients of Paychex, one of the nation\u2019s largest payroll processors, pay their workers \u2014 weekly, biweekly or on some other cycle \u2014 has not shifted by more than 1 percent over the last eight years. Martin Mucci, the company\u2019s chief executive, is skeptical that faster access to wages will ever move beyond the gig economy.\u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019re seeing a large demand for among employees who have a more traditional work relationship with their employer,\u201d Mr. Mucci said.\u201cAs the economy has gotten faster and people\u2019s lives have become more tenuous, the speed at which people get paid starts to matter lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a flash-in-the-pan thing. A year or two in, these are products that have significant user engagement, and they\u2019re growing very quickly.\u201dFor workers, choosing between speed and delayed gratification can be a balancing act.Amanda Brannon, a single mother of four in Warner Robins, Ga., said that same-day pay was a major incentive for her to moonlight for Uber. If she needs to supplement her grocery or gas budget, she hops in her car and starts driving. A recent 12-hour Saturday shift netted her $220, which she cashed out immediately.But in her day job, as a legal secretary, she is happy to stick with a traditional lump-sum check.\u201cIt makes it easier to pay for the big stuff,\u201d Ms. Brannon said. \u201cUber is perfect for daily cash, but getting paid every two weeks is good, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Everyone Can Be \u2018Queer,\u2019 Is Anyone?", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThe speed with which modern society has adapted to accommodate the world\u2019s vast spectrum of gender and sexual identities may be the most important cultural metamorphosis of our time. Facebook, which can be seen as a kind of social census, now offers nearly 60 different gender options, including \u201cquestioning\u201d and \u201cbigender\u201d \u2014 or no gender at all. In a new commercial for Calvin Klein, Young Thug, a slender rapper prone to wearing dresses, states that he feels \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as gender.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recently added Mx, a neutral replacement for titles like Mr. and Mrs. The video game \u201cThe Sims\u201d has even begun allowing players to create same-sex relationships and lifted gender restrictions on characters\u2019 clothing and hairstyles. Plainly, we are in the midst of a profoundly exhilarating revolution. And \u201cqueer\u201d has come to serve as a linguistic catchall for this broadening spectrum of identities, so much so that people who consider themselves straight, but reject heteronormativity, might even call themselves queer. But when everyone can be queer, is anyone?The word became linked to sexual behavior in the early 1900s, as a derogatory term for men deemed effeminate and others who upended traditional gender roles and appearances. As homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and made punishable by law, the word snowballed into a full-blown slur, heard everywhere from the playground (\u201csmear the queer\u201d) to intellectual duels (William F. Buckley Jr. to Gore Vidal: \u201cNow listen, you queer\u201d).This halo of negativity began to dim somewhat in the 1970s, when the word was reclaimed by activists and academics. Not only did its deliberate looseness make it a welcome alternative to the rigidity of \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian,\u201d it also turned the alienating force of the slur into a point of pride. (Though it is still considered offensive by some.) A manifesto distributed at New York City\u2019s Pride parade in 1990 by Queer Nation, a prominent and controversial gay-rights group, put it this way: \u201cWhen a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning, we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we\u2019ve chosen to call ourselves queer. Using \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world.\u201d It was a radical word for a radical time. Protesters and advocacy groups \u2014 particularly communities of color \u2014 took it up to gather support for the fight against the AIDS crisis and for gay rights. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, get used to it\u201d became a popular chant.Academics saw queerness as possessing revolutionary potential. Eve Sedgwick, a professor at Duke who is considered one of the founders of queer theory, described queerness as an \u201copen mesh of possibilities.\u201d David Halperin, a founder of an academic journal on queer studies, describes queerness as a practice, one that is an \u201cexhilarating personal experiment, performed on ourselves by ourselves.\u201d Writing in 1995, Halperin bemoaned the dilution of what he felt was a subversive word. \u201cThere is now a right way to be queer ... to invert the norms of straight society,\u201d he scoffed, referring to clothes, haircuts, piercings, even diets tailored to gay and lesbian buyers. \u201cHow can queer modes of consumption count as resistant cultural practices?\u201d Eight years later, the hit makeover show \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d debuted on Bravo, literalizing Halperin\u2019s concerns. Each episode culminated in a lavish shopping trip that distilled gay culture down to clothes and hair products \u2014 and it was all done in the service of straight men.Increased acceptance of queerness has only led to increased commodification. Every June, the month of most gay-pride celebrations, companies like Netflix, McDonald\u2019s, Apple, Salesforce and Walmart spend tremendous amounts of money to include their branded floats in the parades. This year, Andrew Joliv\u00e9tte, a professor at San Francisco State University, told The Guardian that the city\u2019s event was no longer a symbol of progress. Instead, he said, it felt like a prolonged commercial: \u201cGay Inc.\u201d In the same article, Isa Noyola, a transgender Latina activist in San Francisco, remarked on the paradox that the same companies championing gay rights have contributed to the gentrification that has made the Castro one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic to walk alongside tech companies that have displaced us,\u201d she said.The radical power of \u201cqueer\u201d always came from its inclusivity. But that inclusivity offers a false promise of equality that does not translate to the lived reality of most queer people. Anti-trans bathroom laws and the shooting at Pulse, the gay nightclub in Orlando, are the latest reminders that equality has yet to arrive. Seen this way, such a sunny outlook can, in fact, be counterproductive. DarkMatter, a South Asian trans performance-art duo, highlights this observation \u2014 the way visibility and acceptance can actually lead to erasure \u2014 in their works. In one, called \u201cRainbows Are Just Refracted White Light,\u201d they intone, \u201cRainbows are just a trick of light, they make us forget the storm is still happening.\u201dMaybe we are relying on a single word, a single idea, a single identity, to do too much. After all, \u201cqueer\u201d never belonged to us; it was foisted upon us, and we reconfigured it to make it ours. The future will bring new possibilities and ideas \u2014 and new terms for them. Scientists are still learning about the vast and complex components that interact to create human sexuality. An article in Nature from 2015 delved into the latest research on sex and gender among mice. Sex determination is thought to happen in the womb, but studies of mice suggest that sex can fluctuate between male and female throughout life. Someday, maybe we\u2019ll recognize that queer is actually the norm, and the notion of static sexual identities will be seen as austere and reductive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla and Google Take Different Roads to Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Silicon Valley, where companies big and small are at work on self-driving cars, there have been a variety of approaches, and even some false starts.The most divergent paths may be the ones taken by Tesla, which is already selling cars that have some rudimentary self-driving functions, and Google, which is still very much in experimental mode.Google\u2019s initial efforts in 2010 focused on cars that would drive themselves, but with a person behind the wheel to take over at the first sign of trouble and a second technician monitoring the navigational computer.But Google decided to play down the vigilant-human approach after an experiment in 2013, when the company let some of its employees sit behind the wheel of the self-driving cars on their daily commutes.Engineers using onboard video cameras to remotely monitor the results were alarmed by what they observed \u2014 a range of distracted-driving behavior that included falling asleep.\u201cWe saw stuff that made us a little nervous,\u201d Christopher Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon University roboticist who directs the car project at Google, said at the time.The experiment convinced the engineers that it might not be possible to have a human driver quickly snap back to \u201csituational awareness,\u201d the reflexive response required for a person to handle a split-second crisis.So Google engineers chose another route, taking the human driver completely out of the loop. They created a fleet of cars without brake pedals, accelerators or steering wheels, and designed to travel no faster than 25 miles an hour.For good measure they added a heavy layer of foam to the front of their cars and a plastic windshield, should the car make a mistake. While not suitable for high-speed interstate road trips, such cars might one day be able to function as, say, robotic taxis in stop-and-go urban settings.At the soonest, Google says it hopes to put such vehicles on the market by 2019.\u201cSafety has been paramount for the Google self-driving car team from the very beginning,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, the artificial intelligence researcher who created the Google project. \u201cWe wanted it to be significantly safer to the point where there would be no accidents ever.\u201dSo far Google\u2019s robotic cars have largely succeeded, with just one slow-speed fender bender caused by the robotic driver.Still, no engineering consensus exists about the best path to vehicle autonomy. In and around Silicon Valley, at least 19 commercial self-driving efforts are underway, ranging from big carmakers like Nissan and Ford and technology giants like Google, Baidu and Apple, to shoestring operations like comma.ai.Significantly, Toyota, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, has not joined the rush to self-driving. It has established a research laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., that does not aim to make a car that drives itself, but instead a \u201cguardian angel\u201d \u2014 a computerized system that would take over only when the human driver made an error.Automotive engineers at work on autonomous vehicles refer to a design challenge they call \u201covertrust,\u201d the possibility that humans may not fully understand the limitations of the self-driving safety features they rely on.Tesla notes that Autopilot is meant only to assist drivers, not to replace them. And its onscreen warnings and owner\u2019s manual emphasize that drivers should remain vigilant and keep their hands on or near the wheel at all times.But in tempting its customers with a feature still so experimental that the company refers to it as a \u201cbeta\u201d test, Tesla has sped far ahead of the rest of the industry and in the public\u2019s perception of the state of self-driving technology.Like Mr. Brown, the company\u2019s customers tend to be technically knowledgeable and adventuresome types, who are not necessarily willing to wait for the go-slow approach taken by the rest of the industry. That includes one of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known engineers.\u201cBeta products shouldn\u2019t have such life-and-death consequences,\u201d said Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, who owns a Tesla Model S.Mr. Wozniak concedes he worries that the Autopilot feature might lead him to take his eyes off the road at the wrong moment. But that is a risk he is willing to run.\u201cEven though I might have a slight attention lapse at the exact wrong moment,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s easier to drive this way and not feel as tired.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BY WENDY\u2019SWithin minutes, the 65-acre family-owned ranch in Watsonville, California, bustles with dozens of workers, moving from bush to bush, busily picking blackberries.From there, boxes of berries are whisked away on flatbed trucks to be meticulously checked for quality, cooled to the perfect temperature and then finally loaded onto refrigerated trucks to head to their final destination: atop a heap of lettuce, strawberries, white-meat chicken and feta cheese on Wendy\u2019s Summer Berry Chicken Salad.The blackberries \u2013 and the salad they\u2019re featured in \u2013 reflect the Dublin, Ohio-based restaurant chain\u2019s commitment to using fresh, seasonal ingredients. The sweet and savory salad \u2013 which includes red apple chips and light blackberry vinaigrette and clocks in a diet-respecting 390 calories \u2013 took more than two years to come to fruition.John and Peter NavarroJohn Navarro and his brother, Peter, independent growers based in Watsonville, California, adjusted their crop to help California Giant meet Wendy\u2019s unprecedented request for fresh, seasonal blackberries. Growing berries for Wendy\u2019s seasonal salad, he said, has had a \u201chuge\u201d impact on the family-owned business.\u201cWe have the satisfaction of growing a product we know already has an outlet,\u201d says John, whose father and uncle came to the U.S. from Mexico in the 1950s and, in the early \u201860s, became Watsonville\u2019s first Hispanic growers to own their berry farm. \u201cAs a grower, that\u2019s your main worry.\u201dThe new seasonal salad is an example of the burgeoning farm-to-fork, fast-food trend. It\u2019s getting big these days as diners increasingly expect fresh, quality ingredients.Alissa Rumsey, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said the trend of people \u201crealizing the benefits of fresh, high-quality, seasonal food \u201cextends beyond the grocery aisles and into restaurants.\u201d\u00a0As a result, she says restaurants increasingly are putting an emphasis on \u201cserving seasonal fruits and vegetables, whole grains and quality protein sources.\u201d\u00a0Restaurants like Wendy\u2019s, that focus on providing fresh, quality ingredients, are attracting customers who increasingly are scrutinizing their on-the-go food choices.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to eat things as fresh as possible,\u201d says\u00a0Jenny McCoy, a Brooklyn, New York, pastry chef and author who says she makes sure to choose restaurants that serve fresh, seasonal ingredients \u201cbecause the flavor is so much better.\u201dProspero Lopez DiazHarvesters like Prospero Lopez Diaz begin work on the Navarros\u2019 ranch at 6 a.m. Diaz has been\u00a0picking berries for eight years. He says that, while speed is important, picking berries with care is paramount. Every flat of blackberries can be traced back to the worker who picked them.\u201cIt\u2019s quality control. From the moment that berry\u2019s starting to ripen you want to get it in the box at the optimal time,\u201d independent grower John Navarro says. \u201cIt\u2019s all based on our harvesters\u2019 skill \u2014 they know which berry goes in the box.\u201dOther restaurant chains may be scrambling to catch up with consumer demand, but Wendy\u2019s commitment to quality and freshness has been ingrained in the chain since the beginning. When Wendy\u2019s launched in 1969, founder Dave Thomas was determined to use only fresh \u2013 never frozen \u2013 North American beef in Wendy\u2019s hamburgers. \u201cWe\u2019ve never changed that,\u201d says Joe Loiacano, Wendy\u2019s Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. senior purchasing manager for fresh and agriculture-related products.\u00a0That frequency of delivery and fresh-food supply chain has evolved with the company. It also has enabled Wendy\u2019s to use fresh produce \u2013 such as romaine and iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and berries \u2013 in its more than 5,500 restaurants in the United States. The produce is delivered whole and then washed, cut and prepared by hand onsite.\u00a0The focus on freshness has enabled Wendy\u2019s to take a pioneering role in rolling out everything from freshly prepared salads (it was the first fast-food restaurant to offer its customers a salad bar in 1979) to baked potatoes (which it launched as a french fry alternative in 1983) to seasonal salads with straight-from-the-farm strawberries in 2011. \u00a0Karim ElsayedEvery morning, the restaurant crew arrives early at Wendy\u2019s to wash berries, chop lettuce and prepare produce for customers\u2019 meals. Produce is delivered multiple times a week to the more than 5,500 Wendy\u2019s restaurants and arrives \u201cin a fresh state, whether that\u2019s a whole head of lettuce or a whole tomato,\u201d says the company\u2019s chief communications officer, Liliana Esposito.\u201cOur salads are made every day in every Wendy\u2019s restaurant with hand-sliced lettuce, tomatoes and strawberries,\u201d Esposito says. Blackberries, however, \u201care included whole.\u201dEnsuring freshness isn\u2019t easy. Take, for instance, the decision by Wendy\u2019s to feature blackberries, along with strawberries, in this summer\u2019s seasonal salad.\u00a0Initially, when Wendy\u2019s research and development team came up with the recipe for the Summer Berry Chicken Salad more than two years ago, there was great excitement internally.\u00a0After all, customers had responded with overwhelming positivity to its two previous summer salads that featured strawberries: Berry Almond Salad and Strawberry Fields Salad. And early tests that were conducted in the spring and summer of 2014 in Buffalo, N.Y., Shreveport, La., and Salt Lake City, Utah, showed that customers would equally enjoy blackberries in their salad.\u00a0But the team realized that sourcing the fresh berries\u00a0would be a big problem: There simply weren\u2019t enough fresh, high-quality blackberries available from North American growers to meet the estimated 106 million blackberries Wendy\u2019s would need.And finding blackberries to meet the demands of more than 5,500 restaurants is no easy feat, Loiacano says: \u201cIn addition to the quantity, the quality of the berry also has to meet our specs on size and how it was grown. We\u2019re invested in quality standards of these berries from the day they are planted. \u201dThen, after a more than two-year process, Loiacano and his team found enough berries of Wendy\u2019s quality to meet the company\u2019s volume needs by working with several different blackberry growers.\u00a0These growers were willing to adjust their crops by pruning them so they produced fruit at the right time and by planting new blackberry bushes. But they then had to wait a year for those bushes to mature so that, finally, Wendy\u2019s could provide customers with another industry first \u2013 the first fresh, seasonal blackberry salad from a quick-service restaurant that takes advantage of one of the great tastes of summer.Cindy Jewell, vice president of marketing for California Giant, a family-owned Watsonville, California, berry company that worked with its growers to meet Wendy\u2019s blackberry requirements, says the willingness of its independent growers to adjust their crop for a single customer was unprecedented.The upside for growers, she says, will extend beyond this summer: \u201cOnce people see blackberries in a Wendy\u2019s salad, the writing\u2019s on the wall that it\u2019s going to be a new consumer trend and that there\u2019s going to be a higher consumer demand for blackberries moving forward.\u201dWendy\u2019s customers may not be aware of all the work that went into getting the fresh, seasonal ingredients for the Wendy\u2019s Summer Berry Chicken Salad \u2013 from the farmers who plant the blackberry bushes to the pickers who harvest them to the restaurant workers who wash the berries, chop the lettuce and place a warm,\u00a0white-meat chicken breast on top.\u00a0The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

The proposal would significantly raise the rates that Spotify pays, and the filing includes lines that are clearly directed at Spotify and its so-called freemium model.\u201cAn interactive stream has an inherent value,\u201d Apple wrote, \u201cregardless of the business model a service provider chooses.\u201dA spokeswoman for Apple confirmed the filing but declined to comment further.Last month, Apple said that Apple Music had 15 million subscribers, and Spotify reported that it had 30 million paid users and another 70 million who listen free, with ads.Apple\u2019s filing was made as part of a proceeding by the Copyright Royalty Board to set statutory rates for downloads and interactive streaming services from 2018 to 2022. Spotify, Google, Pandora, Amazon and the Recording Industry Association of America were all expected to file their proposals by Friday, but the panel has not yet made the filings public.Although the bulk of Apple\u2019s proposal with the Copyright Royalty Board is confined to three brief paragraphs, it would have wide implications if it were adopted. Songwriting rates paid by interactive streaming services like Spotify are now governed by a byzantine system that includes a division between what are known as mechanical and performance royalties for the same songs.

{"Headline": "Forget Beanbag Chairs. Amazon Is Giving Its Workers Treehouses.", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byNo, Amazon is growing actual plants, more than 3,000 species of them spread around a one-acre greenhouse a half-hour\u2019s drive from Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle. There are carnivorous pitcher plants, exotic philodendrons and orchids from Ecuador that resemble the menacing flora from \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d\u201cCinnamon, wax candy and baby powder,\u201d said Ron Gagliardo, the Amazon horticulturist who oversees the greenhouse, when asked to describe the mysterious scent of the orchid, called Anguloa virginalis.Amazon pioneered internet shopping, electronic book reading and cloud computing. Now, as it enters adulthood, it is applying some of that inventiveness to its new home. The company is constructing a collection of high-rise and low-rise buildings in downtown Seattle that will be arrayed around three striking transparent, conjoined structures that Amazon calls spheres. They will act as high-tech greenhouses, the kind of flashy architecture that Amazon shunned for the first 22 years of its life.The real point of the spheres is how Amazon wants to use the nature on the inside to inspire employees. When they open in early 2018, the spheres will be packed with a plant collection worthy of top-notch conservatories, allowing Amazon employees to amble through tree canopies three stories off the ground, meet with colleagues in rooms with walls made from vines and eat kale Caesar salads next to an indoor creek.Since Amazon decided about a decade ago to stay in downtown Seattle, the company said, it has invested over $4 billion in the construction and development of offices in the city, though it won\u2019t disclose the budget for the spheres. The spheres will be accessible to Amazon employees only, but the company may eventually allow public tours.\u201cThe whole idea was to get people to think more creatively, maybe come up with a new idea they wouldn\u2019t have if they were just in their office,\u201d said Dale Alberda, the lead architect on the project at NBBJ, a firm that has also worked on building projects for Samsung, Google and the Chinese internet company Tencent.What makes Amazon\u2019s project unusual is its location \u2014 in the heart of a city, rather than on a sprawling suburban campus of the sort favored by most other big tech companies. Amazon, the largest private employer in Seattle, has more than 20,000 employees spread out in more than 30 buildings in the city. Its current construction plans will give it the space to more than double its local head count.Mr. Bezos has said that Amazon is staying put in a city because the kinds of employees it wants are attracted to an urban environment. But the concrete and steel canyons around Amazon\u2019s new downtown properties do not have a lot of greenery. That is where the spheres and Mr. Gagliardo, whom Amazon hired to fill them with plants, enter the picture.Margaret O\u2019Mara, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington, sees the spheres as a kind of Walden Pond under glass. \u201cIt\u2019s a retreat, a cathedral away from the hubbub of the city,\u201d she said.There was plenty of noise inside the spheres on a recent tour, as workers welded steel, pounded bolts into place and sawed concrete inside the half-built structure. The glass panels that make up the carapace of the spheres were being lowered onto steel supports in eye-catching shapes.Wearing a hard hat, Mr. Gagliardo dodged power cords and scaffolding, surveying an enormous mass of concrete where a five-story living wall \u2014 fabric pockets filled with plants \u2014 will eventually be installed. He pointed to where a glass roof panel will be removed and a 45-foot fig tree will be lifted by crane into one of the spheres, one of 40 to 50 trees that will be installed.\u201cBeing able to walk through here, I\u2019m starting to see where things are going to go,\u201d he said.The spheres will have meeting areas called treehouses, and suspension bridges high off the ground that will be just wobbly enough to quicken the pulses of employees who walk over them. \u201cAmazon said, \u2018Make this fun,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Alberda, the architect.Amazon\u2019s architects had to make the spheres welcoming for both plants and people, a space with the abundance of a conservatory but without the stickiness that will fog MacBook screens and make people sweat.During the day, Amazon will keep the spheres at 72 degrees and 60 percent humidity, while at night the temperature will average 55 degrees and the humidity 85 percent, which Mr. Gagliardo said would be optimal for the cloud forest plant specimens it has collected.A growing body of academic research points to the benefits of giving employees access to nature. About a decade ago, Ihab Elzeyadi, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, conducted a study in which workers who were provided with a view of nature experienced a 20 percent reduction in sick leave from their employer, though it was not clear why that happened.Dr. Elzeyadi said he was intrigued by Amazon\u2019s sphere project, but not convinced it would be as effective as letting workers gaze at plants from their desks.\"You\u2019re making a big investment and betting on two big hypotheses,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they leave work and go there and, having that kind of nature-bathing maybe once a week, will it really impact their stress levels?\u201dUntil plants start moving into the spheres next spring, Mr. Gagliardo, 50, dotes on them in their temporary home in the huge greenhouse Amazon has been leasing for the last couple of years. He will continue to tend to the plants for Amazon after they are planted in the spheres.He stops by a welwitschia, a Namibian plant with two leaves, proclaiming it the \u201cugliest plant in the world\u201d and delivering the line with such enthusiasm that it sounds like a compliment. With misters pumping water into the air, he swells with excitement discussing his current love affair with a group of begonias from Southeast Asia.\u201cNext week I\u2019ll be more excited about a different group,\u201d he said.Many of the species Amazon is growing here are endangered or extinct in the wild, acquired from botanical gardens, universities and private growers around the world. Mr. Gagliardo, who previously worked at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and in amphibian conservation, said opportunities to build a plant collection like Amazon\u2019s did not come along often.\u201cI\u2019m a plant curator by heart,\u201d he said. \u201cSo different plant families, amassing a collection of plants, is totally what I geek out on and go crazy about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential.I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not.Notice how today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses.Yahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed.I will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers.Problem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn\u2019t the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully.It\u2019s probably more nuanced than this, but we\u2019re out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog.

Apple has the clout to fend off rivals, but adding Tidal will not help get its rhythm back.It was just two years ago that Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, spent $3 billion for Beats, the streaming music and headphones business owned by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. The co-founders have deep ties to the music industry with roots at Interscope and Death Row Records.And yet Apple\u2019s streaming ambitions have been middling at best. It is redesigning the service after frustrating its approximately 15 million paying subscribers. That is just half as big as Spotify\u2019s 30 million subscriber base.Tidal is struggling, too. It had a star-studded debut last March \u2014 with Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna and Chris Martin of Coldplay \u2014 and promised that an online service owned by artists would be better for artists. But it is on its third chief executive and has not drawn the masses, picking up fewer than five million paying customers, many of them reaped by dropping occasional exclusives from the likes of Kanye West, Prince and others.As sales of iPhones, computers and iPads slow, it is understandable why Apple is setting its sights on other businesses. Revenue from apps, Apple Music subscriptions, along with a few other services, rose 20 percent year-over-year and accounted for 12 percent of its $50 billion in last quarter\u2019s top line.That partly explains why Apple is giving Spotify headaches. Recode reported that Apple will not approve the digital music service\u2019s latest app. Spotify, based in Sweden, is encouraging customers to sign up through its own website, thus bypassing in-app subscriptions. Apple takes a 30 percent cut, though the fee falls to 15 percent after one year. It\u2019s a retributive move \u2013 like a lyric from one of Dre\u2019s old NWA raps.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of chief executives that the music streaming service Tidal has had.

Revenue in the segment rose 19 percent to $6 billion.Still, Apple is still primarily a hardware company and its products did not fare well.Net income was $7.8 billion, or $1.42 a share, down 27 percent.Apple\u2019s weak results were partly a result of the company\u2019s position at the end of its product cycle. In September, it is expected to announce major upgrades to its iPhone hardware and software, which happens every two years. Many Apple customers hold off buying a new phone in the months before a big release so that they can get the newest model.But Apple is also wrestling with longer-term issues. The smartphone market in developed countries like the United States is saturated, and newer markets like India buy hardly any iPhones.China, long a source of growth for Apple, is itself slowing down, with revenue down 33 percent. But revenue from Europe was down just 7 percent. In an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that Apple had experienced little impact from the Brexit vote on sales in Britain.The declines were less steep than Wall Street had expected after the gloomy outlook Apple had laid out three months ago. Shares of Apple rose about 7 percent in after-hours trading.\u201cThe valuations had been driven down based on expectations of no growth,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG Research. \u201cNow investors can start focusing on what they\u2019re going to say in September about the new products.\u201dMr. Maestri said the quarter\u2019s sales drop looked worse than it was because Apple held back on shipments to retailers, particularly in China, so that the stores could clear out their existing inventory of Apple gear. On that basis, iPhone sales were down only 8 percent, Mr. Maestri said.The revenue from iPad sales also rose as customers bought the more expensive iPad Pros even as sales of traditional iPads sank.Apple projected that the next quarter would be a down quarter, but after that, when the new phones are fully in the market, Wall Street expects the company to return to growth.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, suggested that Apple TV in particular might be the basis for substantial innovation but offered no specifics.Mr. Piecyk said that Apple was also increasing its spending on research and development \u2014 a sign of new products in the pipeline beyond simple updates of existing ones.\u201cThere are so many places of pain out there in our lives \u2014 the living room, the car \u2014 where there\u2019s room for substantial improvement,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings referred imprecisely to the company\u2019s product upgrade schedule.

Yahoo is 21 years old, and for more than half its life people have wondered if the company could get the magic back. More than anything, that is a mark of the good will Silicon Valley long held for the company, and its seemingly boyish founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo.For many, not least shareholders, Yahoo would have been better off taking Microsoft\u2019s $44.6 billion bid in 2008, which is almost $50 billion in today\u2019s money. The company is now valued at $35 billion, and the figure is that high only because in February Yahoo decided to sell its core assets (around the same time it announced a big layoff).When so much has gone wrong to something once so seemingly wonderful, one ascribes bad luck, and bad management. When it happens over so many years, under so many different leaders, however, it\u2019s also worth asking whether there wasn\u2019t also some flaw of character, or what in corporate terms is called culture.The Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs reportedly told Yahoo early in the millennium that it had to decide whether it was a tech company or a content company. This was a sensible and profound point, and something Yahoo never accomplished.That may be because content and tech were always contending at Yahoo. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo, two engineers, started out by pointing out cool sites on the young World Wide Web. Human taste, meet high tech.Tim Koogle, the company\u2019s first chief executive, was a mechanical engineer, and was succeeded by Terry Semel, a Hollywood guy who bragged that he didn\u2019t use email. Thereafter, \u201cWhat are we?\u201d was a question Yahoo\u2019s leaders seemed to be perpetually addressing.Human curators at Yahoo, eventually an entire building full of them, tried to apply taste and by-hand content organization of the web even as the web exploded. The two companies Yahoo most famously missed buying \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 were far more successful bypassing human organization, and finding algorithms that worked on things like page links and social posts.If you had to choose between tech and content, clearly tech was the superior way to go (if for no other reason than there was no great content company in Silicon Valley).

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos Is Barred From Running Lab for 2 Years", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byFederal regulators have barred Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive of Theranos, from owning or operating a medical laboratory for at least two years, raising new questions about the future of the embattled blood-testing start-up and its founder, once a Silicon Valley phenomenon.In a letter sent to Theranos that was made public on Friday, regulators said they were revoking the certification of its flagship laboratory in Newark, Calif., effective Sept. 5. They also said the laboratory would be prohibited from taking Medicare and Medicaid payments.The government scrutiny stemmed from questions about the effectiveness of Theranos\u2019s technology and the way the company operated its labs.The company faces a fine of $10,000 for every day it is out of compliance with regulations, effective July 12.Such stern sanctions are \u201cvirtually unheard-of in my 40 years\u2019 experience in the industry,\u201d said David Nichols, president of the Nichols Management Group, a consultant to and operator of clinical laboratories. \u201cI don\u2019t see a path forward for the company.\u201dWhat Theranos and Ms. Holmes will do next is not clear. The company said in its statement that it would continue to operate a laboratory it owns in Arizona, at least for now.But if the license of the California lab is indeed revoked, then Ms. Holmes and Theranos could not own or operate any laboratory, and the Arizona facility would also have to be shut, according to both Theranos and a spokesman for the regulator.Theranos represents the promise and the pitfalls of the start-up era, as money floods into young companies with new technologies in an effort to find a \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 a billion-dollar business that transforms its industry and makes its backers rich in the process.Theranos and Ms. Holmes in particular offered a compelling narrative: a brilliant student who dropped out of college to pursue an audacious idea that would upend the medical testing business, performing multiple tests at low prices using only a finger prick of blood. By last year, Theranos had a valuation of about $9 billion.Ms. Holmes invited comparisons with the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs because of her youth, her tight control of the company she founded, and even her customary black turtlenecks.Theranos made two submissions to the agency of corrective actions. But in its letter to Theranos, dated Thursday, the regulator said the company\u2019s second submission \u201cagain does not constitute a credible allegation of compliance\u201d and had not \u201cabated the immediate jeopardy.\u201d The 33-page letter cited numerous examples of the company\u2019s failing to demonstrate that it had corrected a problem.Theranos said late Thursday and again on Friday that it was shutting down and rebuilding its California lab \u201cfrom the ground up,\u201d and bolstering its personnel and training there. Theranos said it would stop patient testing at the facility immediately, even before the sanctions take effect, but would continue to work with regulators to resolve the issues.\u201cWe accept full responsibility for the issues at our laboratory in Newark, Calif., and have already worked to undertake comprehensive remedial actions,\u201d Ms. Holmes said in a statement.Jane Pine Wood, a lawyer specializing in the regulations of laboratories, said companies could appeal such sanctions and typically do. In most cases, that leads to a settlement that allows the laboratory to continue to operate. But this case may be unique, she said.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is imposing penalties and sanctions on Theranos. They include revoking the license of its flagship laboratory in Newark, Calif., and prohibiting it from taking Medicare and Medicaid payments for its services.Ms. Wood, a partner at the firm McDonald Hopkins, said that in cases in which there was no settlement and the appeal went to a hearing before an administrative judge, laboratories \u201calmost never win.\u201dBut Theranos would not lose its license for the California lab, or its ability to operate the Arizona lab, until after the appeals process is exhausted, buying it some time.Even if the company can continue to operate the Arizona lab, the business there has shrunk. Walgreens, with which Theranos had a deal to perform tests, pulled out of the partnership last month and closed the Theranos blood collection centers that were in about 40 of its drugstores in the Phoenix area. Now Theranos must rely on a handful of collection sites it owns itself.The sanctions could put pressure on Ms. Holmes to step aside, though it was not clear if that could happen without her consent, given her control of the company. Even if she stepped aside as chief executive, the ban on Theranos operating laboratories might still apply.It is also unclear who could or would take her job.\u201cThe company was so tightly controlled by her and Sunny Balwani that there is no clear executive you can name who can take over while she is banned for two years,\u201d said Jondavid Klipp, publisher of Laboratory Economics, an industry newsletter. Mr. Balwani was the chief operating officer at Theranos until he resigned in May.Mr. Klipp said that even if Theranos continued to operate its laboratory, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine why a physician would send a patient to a Theranos lab when there are established, reputable choices.\u201dOne option for the company would be to sell blood-testing machines to other laboratories, rather than operate its own laboratories. It hinted at this on Friday, saying the laboratory was just one of its business units and that \u201cits research and development unit has developed many technologies that are not dependent on running a laboratory.\u2019\u2019It said that the problems found by regulators were primarily in the laboratory operations, not with the company\u2019s proprietary blood testing technology.Still, if it wants to sell equipment to other labs, Theranos would have to prove that its technology really worked. There is great skepticism on that front because Theranos has not published data about its technology\u2019s performance. Ms. Holmes is scheduled to present such data at a laboratory conference on Aug. 1.The idea had appeal. Theranos won backing from tech luminaries like the software mogul Lawrence J. Ellison, and the company counted Henry A. Kissinger, a former secretary of state, and a former Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, among its advisers and directors.Still, federal inspectors found deficiencies in the Newark laboratory that could lead to inaccurate results, including inadequately trained employees and samples stored at the wrong temperature.Theranos promised to overhaul the plant and bring in a new slate of experts to fix its problems. It also voided or corrected numerous results from many tests it performed in the past.Ms. Holmes said in the statement that the company was committed \u201cto demonstrating our dedication to the highest standards of quality and compliance.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the results of a review last year of practices at a Theranos lab. Authorities found that all patient results from a particular blood-clotting test administered from April to September were inaccurate; they did not find that all patient test results were inaccurate.Katie Thomas and Carlos Tejada contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexa, What Else Can You Do? Getting More From Amazon Echo", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byTech FixBILL PYSZCZYMUKA was installing an air-conditioner in an upstairs window last spring when it occurred to him that there was a way to control the machine without getting up from the couch downstairs: his Amazon Echo.\u201cThe moment of truth came when I asked, \u2018Alexa, turn on the air-conditioner,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe unit beeped upstairs, with Alexa telling me, \u2018O.K.\u2019 I thought it was more than O.K. It was cool.\u201dMr. Pyszczymuka is part of a prolific community of Echo tinkerers who are using the smart speaker for much more than playing music. Since Amazon released the Echo last year, it has quickly become the top-selling home audio speaker on Amazon.com and one of the company\u2019s most successful hardware products. While Amazon, which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, has not revealed how many Echos it has sold, people have put the speaker to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool.So I recently revisited the Echo to unearth some of the best tips to getting the most from Alexa. Here\u2019s a rundown.To change the default music player, open the Alexa smartphone app. Then tap Settings, tap Music and Media, and tap Choose Default Music Services and select Spotify for your default music library or Pandora for your default station service. That way, you no longer have to say \u201cPlay Radiohead on Spotify\u201d or \u201cPlay Radiohead on station Pandora\u201d \u2014 you can just say \u201cPlay Radiohead\u201d or \u201cPlay Radiohead station\u201d and the Echo will play music from your service of choice. (Apple Music and Google Play are not supported by the Echo.)Other audio tricks include the ability to ask Alexa to play specific podcasts \u2014 try speaking a command like \u201cAlexa, Play \u2018Fresh Air\u2019\u201d (the NPR show) or \u201cAlexa, Play \u2018This American Life\u2019\u201d (also from NPR). An often-forgotten feature of the Echo is its ability to play live radio stations from all over the world. Just ask Alexa to play the call letters of your favorite radio station like KQED, and the Echo will stream it.Echo tinkerers have been putting the speaker to work in their kitchens. One reason: you can summon Alexa without touching the device, which makes it extremely helpful while preparing food or putting dishes away.Try these basics to get acquainted with Alexa in the kitchen: After you stick a pie or roast in the oven, ask Alexa to set a timer. Need help tripling a recipe? Ask Alexa to do the math (\u201cAlexa, what is three times 127?\u201d). Need to know how many tablespoons are in a cup? Ask Alexa to make the conversion for you.Alexa can also help restock your kitchen. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and are running out of something like Ziploc bags, just say \u201cAlexa, order Ziploc bags\u201d to place an Amazon order right away. If you prefer to pick up the item at a store, say, \u201cAlexa, add Ziploc bags to my shopping list\u201d to affix items to a shopping list in the Alexa smartphone app. The best part about using Alexa to compile a shopping list is that multiple family members can add to it, even after you have left the house.Now that you\u2019re well acclimated to Alexa, consider some advanced hacks, such as configuring the Echo to control different parts of your home, including the thermostat and the light bulbs. This will require buying more gear.Setting up the Smart Plug takes a few minutes. I plugged a bedroom lamp into the Smart Plug, then downloaded the free smartphone app Kasa, which detected the Smart Plug and connected it to my Wi-Fi network.Then I opened the Alexa smartphone app, added the Kasa \u201cskill\u201d (third-party apps for Alexa are called skills) and connected Alexa with my Smart Plug. I subsequently gave the lamp a friendly name: bedroom lamp. Now at night, I can say \u201cAlexa, turn on the bedroom lamp\u201d to light up the bedroom before I walk down the hall.Another nifty use of Alexa is how it can control a smart thermostat, which I tested with my Wi-Fi-controlled Honeywell thermostat. In the Alexa app, I added the Honeywell skill, then scanned for the thermostat and labeled it Honeywell. Saying \u201cEcho, set Honeywell to 80 degrees\u201d set the heater to that temperature. (Alexa also works with other smart thermostats like Nest and the Ecobee 3.)Larger projects like these are expensive and take more technical skill, so I recommend starting with basics like smart lights, plugs and thermostats. Then you can assess whether you need a much smarter home.Looking for more things to do with Echo? Open the Alexa app and add these three skills \u2014 TV Shows, The Bartender and Uber.Then next time you\u2019re couch-surfing, ask Alexa a question like \u201cAsk TV Shows what time \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 airs\u201d to find out what time the show is on. (The answer: Sunday at 11 p.m. eastern on HBO.)Or when trying a new cocktail recipe, say to Alexa, \u201cAsk the bartender how to make a Manhattan\u201d to get a list of ingredients and instructions. And while you are tying your shoes and getting ready to go out, say, \u201cAlexa, ask Uber to request an UberX\u201d to summon a car to your home.The downside of forming a bond with Echo and Alexa? You will wish it can help you with everything, everywhere \u2014 including filing an expense report on the go or turning down the volume of a loud co-worker. At least you will always have a friend waiting for you at home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Silences Doubters With Blockbuster Quarter", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It\u2019s good to be Google. Sometimes it\u2019s just plain great.Revenue rose to $21.5 billion, about $750 million more than analysts were predicting and a 21 percent jump from a year earlier.Earnings per share after excluding certain items was $8.42, or 39 cents more than forecasts. Last year, it was $6.99.Celebration ensued. Alphabet\u2019s shares, which drifted sideways during regular trading, immediately rose 4 percent after hours.In some ways, the quarter was the mirror image of the previous quarter, which was good but not as great as analysts hoped. That knocked the stock back and induced some hand-wringing \u2014 never far below the surface with even the best and most successful internet companies \u2014 that Google\u2019s days of dominance in search and advertising might be on the verge of starting to wane.No such worries were on display on Thursday as executives talked to analysts. Google rose to fame and fortune on desktop searches, but the health of the company is now reflected in its presence on people\u2019s phones, not only with advertising but also with its Android operating system.\u201cThe strength of the quarter is about mobile,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of the Google division where most of the company\u2019s revenue and profits are made. \u201cIt\u2019s transformed the way that people consume information, and Google\u2019s products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience.\u201dLast fall, Google revamped its ad formats and delivery, which have been powering the increase in revenue. The number of paid clicks in the second quarter increased 29 percent from last year, the same rate as in the first quarter. Aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from 2015, the same drop as in the first quarter.Mr. Pichai\u2019s lengthy prepared remarks took a long-term perspective, focusing on the importance of machine learning \u2014 software that adjusts to the user\u2019s experience. It will be, he promised, the source of the next great innovations after the switch to mobile runs its course.Revenue for these \u201cother bets\u201d was $185 million, driven largely by Google Fiber; the thermostat company, Nest; and Verily, a life sciences company. Alphabet said it lost $859 million on \u201cother bets\u201d in the second quarter, more than the $660 million loss a year ago.Alphabet does not break down how many employees work at the moonshots, but in general the company\u2019s head count is rising almost as fast as its revenue. More than 66,000 people now work at the company, up nearly 17 percent over the last year.Some analysts predict that Google will sooner or later need innovation closer to home than its moonshots, somewhat in the mode of the ceaselessly inventive Amazon or Apple.\u201cAmazon took their retailing platform and built a multibillion-dollar stream of web services. Apple is increasingly talking about money from services, not just hardware,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cGoogle needs things that expand beyond advertising to give it greater breadth.\u201dGoogle could eventually be forced to pay billion-dollar fines. It would not miss the money but if the cases succeed in distracting the company and tempering its innovations, that could be a real problem for management and ultimately shareholders. On Thursday, no one seemed unduly worried about this possibility.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Oppressive Gospel of \u2018Minimalism\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIt has become an ostentatious ritual of consumerist self-sacrifice; people who have it all now seem to prefer having nothing at all. And, as with watching birds or going Paleo, talking about the material purge is just as important as actually doing it. So there are blog posts \u2014 in which you can see minimalism\u2019s can-do optimism curdle into something tyrannical.Despite its connotations of absence, \u201cminimalism\u201d has been popping up everywhere lately, like a bright algae bloom in the murk of postrecession America. From tiny houses to microapartments to monochromatic clothing to interior-decorating trends \u2014 picture white walls interrupted only by succulents \u2014 less now goes further than ever. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by the minimalism glut, as the word can be applied to just about anything. The nearly four million images tagged #minimalism on Instagram include white sneakers, clouds, the works of Mondrian, neon signs, crumbling brick walls and grassy fields. So long as it\u2019s stylishly austere, it seems, it\u2019s minimalist.Part pop philosophy and part aesthetic, minimalism presents a cure-all for a certain sense of capitalist overindulgence. Maybe we have a hangover from pre-recession excess \u2014 McMansions, S.U.V.s, neon cocktails, fusion cuisine \u2014 and minimalism is the salutary tonic. Or perhaps it\u2019s a method of coping with recession-induced austerity, a collective spiritual and cultural cleanse because we\u2019ve been forced to consume less anyway. But as an outgrowth of a peculiarly American (that is to say, paradoxical and self-defeating) brand of Puritanical asceticism, this new minimalist lifestyle always seems to end in enabling new modes of consumption, a veritable excess of less. It\u2019s not really minimal at all.The word\u2019s meaning wasn\u2019t entirely literal when it first came into being; \u201cminimalism\u201d was popularized in 1965 as an insult. In an essay for Arts Magazine, the British philosopher Richard Wollheim used it to describe a group of artists whose work was characterized by \u201cminimal art content\u201d \u2014 that is, a lack of art. Arranging bricks on a gallery floor (as Carl Andre did) or manufacturing metal boxes (Donald Judd) or fluorescent light fixtures (Dan Flavin) simply wasn\u2019t, in Wollheim\u2019s estimation, enough to make an object worthy of the title. For good reason, the artists singled out in the essay didn\u2019t identify with Wollheim\u2019s appellation. They used industrial materials to remove themselves from their work, intentionally. In their eyes, this formal frugality was a necessary correction to the heroic individualism of New York School Abstract Expressionism. (After some time, what can you see in a Pollock but Pollock himself?) But the name stuck.Still, the artists were maximalists of a sort: The austerity of their objects freed the viewer to experience the work in any way they wished. \u201cMinimalism can return you to this basic state where you\u2019re perceiving purely,\u201d says David Raskin, a professor of contemporary art history at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. \u201cLess is more because you strip away the familiar,\u201d opening an opportunity to see the world without preconceptions. The objects might look mundane, but rather than the plain metal box on the floor, it\u2019s the stark sensory experience the object incites that is the art, no previous knowledge necessary. The artist opens a radical infinity of possibilities. \u201cMinimalism in the 1960s was very much along the lines of taking LSD,\u201d says Miguel de Baca, an associate professor of art history at Lake Forest College.\u201cMinimalism\u201d was eventually canonized as an art-historical movement, but the name came to mean something different as it was adopted into consumer culture and turned into a class signifier. What was once a way artists shocked viewers became over the decades a style as delimited and consumable as any Martha Stewart tablescape. The word was defanged, no longer a critical insult and no longer a viable strategy within art \u2014 though it never quite gave up its veneer of provocation. Even austerity can be made decadent: To wealthy practitioners, minimalism is now little more than a slightly intriguing perversion, like drinking at breakfast. \u201cOne of the real problems with design-world minimalism is that it\u2019s just become a signifier of the global elite,\u201d Raskin says. \u201cThe richer you are, the less you have.\u201dToday\u2019s minimalism, by contrast, is visually oppressive; it comes with an inherent pressure to conform to its precepts. Whiteness, in a literal sense, is good. Mess, heterogeneity, is bad \u2014 the opposite impulse of artistic minimalism. It is anxiety-inducing in a manner indistinguishable from other forms of consumerism, not revolutionary at all. Do I own the right things? Have I jettisoned enough of the wrong ones? In a recent interview with Apartamento magazine set against interior shots of his all-white home in Rockaway, Queens, the tastemaker and director of MoMA PS1 Klaus Biesenbach explained, \u201cI don\u2019t aim to own things.\u201dThese minimalist-arrivistes present it as a logical end to lifestyle, culture and even morality: If we attain only the right things, the perfect things, and forsake all else, then we will be free from the tyranny of our desires. But time often proves aesthetic permanence, as well as moral high ground, to be illusory. And already, the pendulum is swinging back.There\u2019s an arrogance to today\u2019s minimalism that presumes it provides an answer rather than, as originally intended, a question: What other perspectives are possible when you look at the world in a different way? The fetishized austerity and performative asceticism of minimalism is a kind of ongoing cultural sickness. We misinterpret material renunciation, austere aesthetics and blank, emptied spaces as symbols of capitalist absolution, when these trends really just provide us with further ways to serve our impulse to consume more, not less.Kyle Chayka is a writer living in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}
