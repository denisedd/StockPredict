{"Headline": "Buying the Shirt Off Justin Bieber\u2019s Back", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byThey waited three hours, sometimes in driving rain, to ascend to the fifth floor of a parking garage in Miami Beach. It was the Fourth of July weekend, but the lines went down the block. The promised land was a glass box aerie filled with Justin Bieber-branded T-shirts, sweatshirts and hats.The box could have been a merchandise stand at a Bieber concert \u2014 most of the items were branded \u201cPurpose,\u201d the name of Mr. Bieber\u2019s new album (which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart) and current tour \u2014 except that it was in Alchemist, a fashion boutique with an outpost in the garage of a Herzog & de Meuron complex. The shop more often is given over to high-end women\u2019s wear by Rick Owens, Chrome Hearts or Haider Ackermann. But for two days, a collection of Bieberiana took over the space, drawing not only Mr. Bieber\u2019s die-hard fans and the requisite eBay resellers, but also streetwear wonks and fashion girls, Mr. Bieber\u2019s new converts.\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d said Roma Cohen, the owner of Alchemist. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had anything that is for those high-fashion fans that love Rick and Chrome Hearts as well as their little sisters.\u201dThe pop-up resulted in the store\u2019s best 48 hours of business ever.\u201dThey\u2019re still coming in for it, calling and emailing,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. The few pieces that are still available in Alchemist\u2019s other location on the complex\u2019s ground floor hang alongside items by the French couturier Azzedine Ala\u00efa.The interest of a newly rabid fashion fan base in what used to be dismissed as mere \u201cmerch\u201d has not gone unnoticed by the fashion industry. Mr. Bieber is riding the wave of a boom in concert merchandise, and after seeing the more fashion-forward aesthetic of the Purpose merchandise, and the success of its pop-ups, Barneys New York will carry an exclusive Purpose capsule collection. It arrives July 16 at Barneys stores in New York, Beverly Hills, Calif., and San Francisco and online. It is the first time Barneys has carried a musician\u2019s touring merchandise.\u201cIt was a no-brainer for me,\u201d said Jay Bell, a senior vice president at Barneys who oversees the men\u2019s designer section. \u201cIt is the first time we\u2019ve done it, but it felt right. It felt like something that would resonate with our customers, and that could sit seamlessly with the other brands we sell.\u201dThe Barneys capsule collection ranges from the expected T-shirts to jerseys and jeans, all the way to $1,675 leather jackets.\u201cIt\u2019s important for an artist to break out of that idea of merch as a T-shirt, as a simple memento souvenir, because at the end of the day, they\u2019re driving the trends,\u201d said Mat Vlasic, the newly appointed chief executive of Bravado, a merchandise and licensing company that produces Mr. Bieber\u2019s Purpose collection. \u201cThey\u2019re driving fashion. They should own it a little more. And we should, too.\u201dConcert tees, especially vintage ones, have been status-symbol garments for decades. Industry veterans fondly recall the graphic forays of the Grateful Dead; for a younger generation, there was Axl Rose, bellowing onstage in his own Guns N\u2019 Roses tee. But today\u2019s artists are accustomed to hobnobbing in the fashion world, which both supports them and harnesses their celebrity for its own ends. Rihanna is a face of Dior; in 2015, Mr. Bieber was made a chiseled body of Calvin Klein, which also sponsors the Purpose tour.With the business of merchandise on the rise (Bravado\u2019s revenues have increased fourfold since Universal Music Group acquired the company in 2007), it was perhaps inevitable that some artists would look to expand their collections themselves.Mr. Bieber is only the latest artist to nudge his merchandise into the realm of fashion. The godfather of the current phenomenon is Kanye West, the fashion-obsessed rapper who has toggled between fashion and music, trying out a high-end women\u2019s collection at Paris Fashion Week before settling into the sportier Yeezy collection for men and women.But he has been just as attuned to his graphic, self-branded touring merchandise, taking cues from the fashion industry to promote and distribute it: niggling over details in the in-arena merch stands, announcing pop-ups minutes before they open.His fellow stars took note. Now Beyonc\u00e9 sells fashionably ironic shirts that read \u201cBoycott Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d Selena Gomez has a 30-piece collection of her own \u2014 including bandannas and patch-covered denim shorts \u2014 for sale at her Revival tour concerts or available for pre-order. Zayn Malik recently began selling his Arabic-printed bomber jackets and hoodies online.Working hand in hand with many of the top artists \u2014 not only Mr. Bieber, but Mr. West, Ms. Gomez and Guns N\u2019 Roses, too \u2014 is Bravado. (Despite being owned by Universal Music Group, Bravado is not limited to Universal artists.)Bravado functions as a fashion house in miniature, with its own design studio, production contracts and licensers who broker deals for its artists and its merchandise. A tour through the Bravado showroom in its concrete offices in Midtown Manhattan takes a visitor past Queen-branded wine, Rolling Stones tequila, Beatles Hot Wheels cars and a Michael Jackson slot machine.On Bravado\u2019s in-house design team, 16 people work on lines for more than 200 artists, many of whom are directly involved in the process. Ariana Grande had been FaceTiming the Bravado team in the days before one meeting there; the rapper Desiigner was en route to a meeting at the office after another. In an earlier generation, many of Bravado\u2019s design team would have labored over album sleeves \u2014 in fact, some did. Dawud West, a veteran of Def Jam records, where he designed an album cover for Jay Z, now designs Guns N\u2019 Roses T-shirts for Bravado.\u201cPrint work is not really in demand anymore,\u201d he said. Merchandise has helped to fill the void.For those young fans still in the market for a T-shirt with Mr. Bieber\u2019s angelic preteen face \u2014 the merchandise of an earlier era \u2014 the older goods are, quietly, still available. But for Purpose, Mr. Bieber enlisted Jerry Lorenzo, whose best-selling Fear of God label makes up the majority of his touring wardrobe, to work with Bravado on a collection that, unlike his previous merchandise, he was willing to wear himself, and does.The intervention of Mr. Lorenzo, who previously worked with Mr. West on his Yeezus tour designs, brought a harder, more fashion-forward edge, drawing on the heavy metal and rock tees of the past. It was part of a \u201cvery conscious\u201d effort to recalibrate Mr. Bieber\u2019s image, Mr. Vlasic said: He \u201cvery much was in a narrow demo of screaming girls, and all of a sudden the door\u2019s flipped open to a much larger audience.\u201d His apparel, as well as his new sound, has brought new fans into the fold (or at least out of the shadows).There they were, lined up outside VFiles, the trendsetting SoHo boutique, at the first Bieber pop-up, in May, waiting to buy. \u201cWe nearly had a riot in the street,\u201d said Julie Anne Quay, the founder of VFiles.Mr. Vlasic recalled, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really Bieber fans on the line.\u201d (Those fans were camped out across the street, to get the best view of Mr. Bieber if he came.) \u201cIt was made up mostly of streetwear guys. I call them the Hypebeast, Supreme guys. That was the most interesting thing.\u201dFor women, too, Purpose has become part of a high-end designer wardrobe, to judge by the editors and designers who have taken to wearing it.Many have noted a kinship between cult T-shirts by Vetements, fashion\u2019s runway fascination of the moment, and those in the Purpose collection. Rather than carp about the connection, Demna Gvasalia, the Vetements head designer, embraced it. A sweatshirt from the fall 2016 collection reads \u201cJustin 4Ever,\u201d and Mr. Gvasalia created a \u201cStaff\u201d shirt of his own, which he wore to the Vetements fashion show in July. (The back of the Bieber \u201cStaff\u201d shirt lists the Purpose tour dates; the back of the Vetements one lists the members of the Vetements team, in the same style.) The Vetements T-shirt will be sold as part of its spring 2017 collection, a spokeswoman confirmed.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen those,\u201d Mr. Lorenzo said of the Vetements pieces. \u201cWe kind of riff on their vibe, too.\u201dAs Purpose noses its way into Fashion Week, it raises the question: Is it fashion?Mr. Bieber himself, who expressed his admiration for fashion labels \u2014 \u201ceverything from Saint Laurent to Calvin Klein to Yeezy\u201d \u2014 noted that men\u2019s fashion in particular is indebted to streetwear, skate, sport and rock, as is his collection.\u201cI\u2019m happy and proud people are reacting to it and adopting it,\u201d he said via a spokesman. \u201cI don\u2019t think of our tour merch as being \u2018fashion.\u2019 That\u2019s a really high compliment for what it is. But I am really happy we were able to dial in to something cool the way we did.\u201dNot every one of his admirers is inclined to agree.\u201cI saw it on one of my friends and I was like, \u2018I have to get that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething that back in the day we would have found so stupid and never be caught dead wearing is now the hit piece of the season.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lesson From a Doughnut Fryer Debacle: Let the eBay Seller Beware", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerBut every once in a while, the Haggler fails, and for reasons that are pretty interesting. And when that happens, he has no choice but to man up and share.Q. In April, a customer ordered a doughnut fryer from me on eBay. The unit costs about $1,400 and requires a specific electrical environment \u2014 the right wattage and amperes \u2014 which was noted in my online description of the product.The customer later claimed that the machine \u201cruns slow,\u201d a sign that the fryer is not getting the juice it needs. But instead of sending back the machine, on her dime \u2014 a condition of sale that I laid out in the item\u2019s description \u2014 the customer claimed that it was defective.The reason? A \u201cdefective item\u201d claim allows eBay buyers to return items without abiding by the seller\u2019s conditions, which in this case included a return shipping fee. Further, when a customer opens an eBay return request, the purchase price of the item is immediately seized from the seller\u2019s PayPal account.I tested this machine before I sent it. I even sent a video of that test to the customer. I\u2019ve sold hundreds of these machines, with great feedback.But after eBay looked into the matter, I got an email stating that the company was siding with the buyer. Now eBay demands I pay return shipping and refund the buyer, or the company will give her the refund and let her keep the machine.I think that eBay\u2019s conduct is indefensible. Can you get it to look at this again?A. Mr. Erike is one of many eBay sellers furious over what critics call a \u201cbuyer always wins\u201d policy. For years, sellers on the site have complained about that policy, and in some instances, they have sued.Why would eBay favor buyers over sellers? Because of money, said Anthony A. Ferrigno, one of the lawyers for Ms. Campbell.\u201cIf the contract is rescinded, if there is no sale, then the company does not collect final value fees,\u201d said Mr. Ferrigno, who spoke on the phone to the Haggler recently. In short, if the deal is unwound, eBay does not get paid.EBay has responded in court that under the terms of its user agreement, it can do what it likes. The company phrased it a little differently in a court filing in the Campbell case: \u201cBuyers and sellers permit us to make a final decision at our sole discretion.\u201dWhat about that user agreement?EBay has \u201cpolicies and practices in there that require the company to be neutral arbiters in the resolution process,\u201d Mr. Ferrigno said. For proof, he pointed to a few snippets in eBay\u2019s user agreement that essentially state the company will be fair: \u201cSellers may not have to pay a reimbursement for an eBay claim if they provide the documentation,\u201d such as \u201cproof that the item was as described.\u201dMr. Erike says that he provided exactly that proof with his video, while the customer declined even to send a photo of her electrical setup. Nonetheless, an eBay employee named Brad B. sent Mr. Erike an email in late May that first hit some sympathetic chords (\u201cI can understand how upsetting it can be to have a case opened against you\u201d), but underscored that evidence was kind of beside the point.\u201cIf a seller has a return policy\u201d \u2014 that is to say, a policy that returns are accepted under certain conditions \u2014 \u201ceBay does not require valid proof from the buyer and take them at their word,\u201d Mr. B. wrote, ungrammatically. \u201cIf you have a return policy you are obligated to take the item back regardless of the buyer\u2019s claim.\u201dThe Haggler emailed eBay on Mr. Erike\u2019s behalf in the hopes of persuading the company to re-examine its conclusions. That didn\u2019t work. It only produced the following bit of email boilerplate:\u201cWhile the overwhelming majority of transactions go smoothly, eBay has designed a set of robust polices and standards geared toward fairness in cases where eBay needs to step in to adjudicate. We\u2019ve reached out to this seller to provide best practices to avoid similar scenarios in the future.\u201dHere\u2019s the update: Ms. Cohen has not received a new doggy door. Mr. Crouley has also stopped responding to the Haggler\u2019s emails.So there you have it. Two Haggler failures, one column. Mamma mia.EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT. Keep it family-friendly and under 250 words, include your hometown and go easy on the caps-lock key. Letters may be edited for clarity and length.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk of Tesla Sticks to Mission Despite Setbacks", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors, sat in a glass-walled conference room here last week in the company\u2019s auto factory. Around him, workers and robots were building the $70,000 luxury vehicles that have redefined how people think about electric cars.And then there is his plan for the world\u2019s largest battery factory. The so-called Gigafactory, in Nevada, is to be unveiled this week.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be really crazy about the Gigafactory is not just that it\u2019s giant,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the world with tiny factories that move slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need big factories with high-velocity output.\u201dScale and speed are watchwords for Mr. Musk and his save-the-world view of business, which addresses some of the biggest pressure points in climate change. Mr. Musk wants to create an alternative to fossil fuels by popularizing solar power and by using batteries to store energy from the sun and wind to power homes, cars and businesses at any time of day and in any season.It was the first known fatality of someone operating Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system, a technology meant to prevent such disasters by controlling both steering and braking. Tesla acknowledges that neither the car nor Mr. Brown engaged the brakes, and it says that the Autopilot system failed to see the white trailer against a bright Florida sky.Critics say Tesla was premature in putting the collision-avoidance system on the market last October \u2014 technology that Mr. Musk hailed soon after as \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dAnd they say Tesla sent a dangerous message by calling it Autopilot, suggesting that the system could operate the car by itself, even though it requires drivers to stay completely engaged in case something goes wrong.\u201cTesla shouldn\u2019t make guinea pigs of its buyers,\u201d said Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.In essence, critics say, a company bent on speed needs to understand when to slow down. But Mr. Musk said a regret of his was not having introduced Autopilot even sooner.With a view of the Tesla factory floor, and searching an invisible horizon as he collected his thoughts, he said that Mr. Brown\u2019s death was \u201cvery sad.\u201d Still, the technology enhances safety, he insisted, and one death in what the company counts as 140 million miles driven using Autopilot does not undermine that idea.\u201cThe easy decision would be to, or easier, I suppose, from the standpoint of minimizing attacks and criticism, would be to delay it and try to wait for some point where it\u2019s theoretically better,\u201d Mr. Musk said of Autopilot. \u201cBut if you wait for any point past the point that it\u2019s better than the cars that exist, you\u2019re making a decision to kill people with statistics.\u201dOther automakers, some with their own versions of collision-avoidance technology, have been publicly silent about the Autopilot controversy, while privately muttering about Tesla.Some of it could be schadenfreude. Mr. Musk has made a point of ridiculing the mainstream auto industry as too slow to change. And there is no doubt that Tesla, by proving that electric cars can be cool, must-have consumer products that can travel 200 miles between charges, has put pressure on other automakers to step up their own electric-vehicle efforts.But many on Wall Street say it matters little whether Tesla changes the world if it also keeps losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Electric utility companies also view Mr. Musk warily, filing regulatory challenges to his bid to revolutionize the way energy is generated, transported, stored and paid for.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.Although many in the financial community dismiss the merger proposal as mainly a way for Mr. Musk to have Tesla shareholders protect his investment in SolarCity, environmentalists say the consolidation plan makes a lot of sense.Musk devotees say his great talent is taking green-energy ideas, which others have long discussed in theory, and turning them into realities.\u201cHe makes a reasonable bid to be the Henry Ford of this era,\u201d said Bill McKibben, the environmental activist and author. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to kick off the mass market for renewable energy.\u201dMr. Musk says there\u2019s no time to spare.\u201cIt\u2019s the most serious thing that humanity faces,\u201d he said of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest problem in the world.\u201d\u201cThe faster we can transition to low carbon, maybe, ultimately, to a negative carbon economy, the better.\u201dIn high-desert heat outside Reno, Nev., last week, J. B. Straubel looked out at a vast dirt patch, a construction site that had just broken ground.\u201cThis will be building batteries in 12 months,\u201d said Mr. Straubel, Tesla\u2019s chief technology officer and a co-founder of the company with Mr. Musk.Behind Mr. Straubel was another part of the factory, already built and partly up and running. The buildings here will eventually make up the $5 billion Gigafactory, covering 10 million square feet and projected to put out what the company says will be more lithium-ion batteries each year than were produced globally in all of 2013.Tesla is planning a grand opening on Friday of the Gigafactory, intended to be Mr. Musk\u2019s 21st-century answer to Henry Ford\u2019s sprawling River Rouge plant, which transformed the concept of mass production in the 1920s.Mr. Straubel said speed was of the essence in getting the factory up to full production. \u201cThere\u2019s a sheer business need for it. Compressing the schedule tends to make things cheaper.\u201dIt is a view he clearly shares with Mr. Musk.\u201cIf affordability improves,\u201d Mr. Musk said during the interview in Fremont, \u201cthen more people can buy an electric car, more people can buy solar, more people can buy stationary storage.\u2019\u2019To help make his electric cars less expensive, Mr. Musk is intent on picking up the pace at Tesla\u2019s car factory. It produces 2,000 cars a week, only about a third as many as a conventional automaker\u2019s factory might crank out.Ramping up production is crucial to the next stage of the master plan: building a lower-cost version of the Tesla car. The new Model 3, to be priced at $35,000 \u2014 half as much as the Model S \u2014 is expected to come out in late 2017, and Tesla says it already has 373,000 preorders.For all his talk of speed, Mr. Musk, a physicist by training, is painstakingly deliberate, pausing between sentences.His wit can be so dry and understated as to go undetected, as when he joked to an audience at last fall\u2019s Paris climate talks that greenhouse gas is the natural world\u2019s \u201cturd in the punch bowl.\u201d The remark drew few laughs.The Paris climate accord epitomizes the slow international political and bureaucratic pace involved in building a consensus on the environmental crisis and trying to respond to what scientists increasingly view as the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced.Mr. Musk has positioned Tesla as an agile responder that can help consumers save the planet while the policy makers are still drafting position papers. Still, he has had his share of government help.Along with benefits like government subsidies to consumers of solar panels and electric cars, Tesla received $465 million in loans in 2010 from the Department of Energy to work on fuel-saving vehicle technology. Those loans were repaid in 2013.And it is with heavy financial assistance from New York State that SolarCity is building a 1.2-million-square-foot factory in Buffalo. (Tesla points out that oil and gas companies benefit from far greater subsidies).Even if Tesla meets its goals, of course, Mr. Musk alone cannot reverse climate change. If Tesla winds up with a half-million of its cars on the road in the next three years, for example, that would be a scant fraction of the country\u2019s more than 260 million motor vehicles.\u201cWill these cars make a meaningful difference themselves? No,\u201d David Keith, an assistant professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said of Tesla. The greater influence, Mr. Keith said, is cultural.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time, possibly ever,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a green product, with significant environmental credentials, has been the thing that everybody wanted.\u201dJeff Nesbit, former head of legislative and public affairs at the National Science Foundation under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, said Tesla\u2019s value could also be measured by the pressure it places on other carmakers to match it.\u201cHe\u2019s driving everybody else,\u201d Mr. Nesbit said. \u201cThat\u2019s the power Musk has.\u201dUtilities, whatever their resentments, are paying attention, too.\u201cElon is truly the archetype of the disruptive entrepreneur,\u201d said Andrew Beebe, a former electric industry executive who is now a venture capital investor. \u201cUtilities and utility executives, because of the success on the vehicle side, are absolutely taking note.\u201dOne nagging question about the Tesla quest involves the company\u2019s reliance on lithium-ion batteries. The chemistry can be volatile, and several early Teslas caught fire before the company built a titanium shield under the vehicle to guard against fire or damage.Another question: Can the batteries, even at the Gigafactory\u2019s massive scale, be made cheap enough to persuade most consumers to kick their fossil-fuel habit?After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cHe\u2019s got to get a little lucky,\u201d said John B. Goodenough, who turns 94 on Monday, the physicist who helped pioneer the rechargeable lithium-ion battery at Oxford University in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cI do give him credit just for audacity.\u201dMr. Musk, born in Pretoria in 1971 to a father who was a electromechanical engineer and a mother who was a model, emigrated at age 17 to Canada. He later moved to the United States and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and economics.He made his first millions through Zip2, an internet mapping and search business he founded with his younger brother, Kimbal, in 1995, and sold to Compaq four years later. Mr. Musk\u2019s next company, an electronic payment business, evolved into PayPal, for which he reportedly received $165 million when eBay bought it in 2002.Tesla was still in its infancy when Mr. Musk put his money behind it in 2004. By then he had founded SpaceX, with the aim of developing reusable rockets to eventually send people to Mars.So far, despite some spectacular and fiery failures of its test rockets, SpaceX has launched satellites for commercial use and is the first private company to dock with, and provide supplies to, the International Space Station. It sent a payload to the space station last week on a rocket that then returned and made a safe landing in Florida. Under a NASA contract, SpaceX is to begin sending astronauts to the station in the next few years.SolarCity, for its part, sprang from a 2004 road trip to Burning Man, during which Mr. Musk and his cousin Lyndon Rive mused about solar power\u2019s potential for countering climate change.Mr. Musk says his ventures should eventually be judged on \u201cthe degree to which they have accelerated the advent of sustainable energy.\u201d If he speeds up adoption by five to 10 years, he said, that would be a good outcome.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t really care about business all that much,\u201d said Mr. Musk, whose net worth Forbes estimates to be $12.5 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my first motivation.\u201dYet Tesla exists in a business world, where many competitors and critics may be rooting for his failure. The Autopilot story, and the death of Joshua Brown, gave them a narrative with more than money at stake.\u201cThings are like especially intense right now,\u201d Mr. Musk acknowledged.Tesla began installing cameras, sensors and other hardware for Autopilot in 2014, adding the software a year later to make the system functional.The basic version of Autopilot includes collision warning systems and emergency braking. A fuller option package allows for assisted steering and adaptive cruise control. Activating it requires the driver\u2019s acknowledgment that the technology is new and is still in \u201cpublic beta phase\u201d testing. Each time drivers turn it on, it warns them to keep their hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over.Consumer Reports has been warning since October, when full-dress Autopilot was rolled out, that the system has flaws. This month the magazine called on Tesla to disable the technology.\u201cAutopilot gives you the idea that it is more capable than it is, and once people view it as autonomous, they disengage and divert their eyes from the road,\u201d Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing, said in an interview.He and other safety experts also note that Autopilot continues operating even if drivers do not touch the steering wheel for several minutes.Mr. Fisher said that he had driven Teslas hands-free for more than three minutes, and that even when Autopilot warned him that he had gone too long without touching the steering wheel, the car continued driving for 30 seconds before the feature shut itself down.In a video in early April, Mr. Brown narrated as Autopilot swerved to miss a truck on a highway that had cut in front of him. After Mr. Musk publicized that video with a Twitter post on April 17, it spread quickly online.A little over three weeks later, Mr. Brown had the fatal collision that Autopilot failed to avoid.All of this has provided fuel for Tesla\u2019s critics. But Mr. Musk said the detractors were overreacting and ignoring Autopilot\u2019s lifesaving benefits.And so for Tesla, it is full throttle forward. Waiting to deploy Autopilot, he said, would have been worse than merely going slow.\u201cTo make that decision simply in order to avoid criticism,\u201d Mr. Musk said, \u201cthat\u2019s a terrible act of cowardice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of preorders Tesla has for the Model 3.

{"Headline": "High-Tech Wagering Sees Gateway Into America: The Horse Track", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 Ever since the first bookie stood on a step ladder and scrawled odds on a chalkboard, betting on horse racing was just about picking winners.No more.Here, where betting on a horse race (or anything at all) is a cherished pastime, you can wager on a horse to lose.You can bet in the middle of a race \u2014 much the way Wall Street traders buy and sell stock based on market fluctuations \u2014 and even cash out a winning ticket before the race is over, if the price is right.This new style of betting, called exchange wagering, was pioneered by Paddy Power Betfair, helping it become the world\u2019s largest publicly traded online gambling company.Exchange wagering has been available since May in New Jersey, where Betfair will sponsor the Haskell Stakes on Sunday at Monmouth Park in Oceanport. It is part of a broader strategy to woo young gamblers comfortable with fast-paced, tech-focused betting and get ahead in what is expected to be the widespread legalization of sports gambling in the United States.Betfair is not the only European bookmaker to target the United States, where momentum for legalizing sports betting is at a high. The bookmaker William Hill, based in London, has become a dominant operator of sports books in Nevada, where betting on games is already legal.But Paddy Power, through its subsidiary Betfair US, has chosen horse racing as its American beachhead and exchange wagering as its lure to draw new customers. Think eBay for gamblers, with wagers being made in real time by traders allowed to post odds and prices for peers to accept or reject.In betting parlance, the over/under is five years on when legalized sports gambling will be available outside Nevada.\u201cThere is no question in my mind we\u2019re going to have this happen,\u201d Tim Wilmott, the chief executive of Penn National Gaming, a company with 27 casinos and racetracks in 17 states, said recently at the East Coast Gaming Congress in Atlantic City.The European incursion has met resistance from American racetrack operators, many of whom are also gambling companies. Two of the biggest, Churchill Downs Inc. and the Stronach Group, fear exchange wagering will cut into their profits. While Churchill operates the Kentucky Derby and the Stronach Group the Preakness Stakes, both have prohibited Betfair\u2019s exchange wagering, citing concerns it will encourage race fixing.\u201cThere are integrity issues,\u201d said Mike Rogers, the president of the racetrack division of the Stronach Group, which owns prestigious tracks in California and Florida. \u201cExchange waging allows a customer to bet a horse to lose, and we are still concerned about the current economics that is being returned to the industry.\u201dBut Betfair is pushing ahead, with its sights on what could be lucrative terrain if sports betting is legalized beyond Nevada.Legislators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and California have already pushed legislation to legalize sports betting in order to increase state revenue. A formal lobbying effort on Capitol Hill for the expansion of legalized wagering by casinos and gambling interests may begin as early as 2017.American professional sports leagues, once among the fiercest opponents, are getting ready for an era in which betting is legal. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said that betting on his league\u2019s games should be legal and regulated.The N.H.L. recently awarded its 31st franchise to Las Vegas, Sin City itself.Some see the rush to embrace gambling as just that, a rush without careful scrutiny.\u201cWe are pretty concerned about the ability of states to adequately address the impacts of legalized and expanded sports betting on problem gamblers and other vulnerable groups,\u201d said Keith S. Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, which as a group remains neutral on legalized gambling. \u201cThey have done a pretty terrible job with most other forms of legalized gambling.\u201dStill, there are signs the public wants to bet on sports. Nearly two-thirds of the population \u2014 63 percent, according to a recent poll by Seton Hall University \u2014 believes that betting on sports should be legal, and 68 percent of the respondents said sports betting\u2019s legality should be decided at the state level.Last year, Nevada sports books took in a record $4.2 billion in legal wagers, a number that is dwarfed by the billions bet illegally through offshore internet sites or operations run by organized crime. Nearly $150 billion is bet illegally by people in the United States, according to estimates by law enforcement and industry groups, a number that easily doubles when illegal wagering globally is factored in.Under a ratio used in Nevada, the American Gaming Association concluded American casinos could increase annual revenue by at least $8 billion if sports betting was extended beyond Nevada.With advanced technologies \u2014 mobile as well as online \u2014 already in place and a record of taking bets at a large scale, William Hill and Betfair have a huge head start on their American competitors.In Betfair\u2019s case, it is almost a turnkey operation. It already owns two television channels that broadcast more than 40,000 races a year and is available in more than 40 million homes in the United States.It also operates an online betting site, TVG, that handles $1 billion annually on horse racing bets in the United States.\u201cThey already got very robust services in place,\u201d said Sebastian Sinclair, president of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a research and consulting firm that specializes in gambling and entertainment. \u201cThey also have gone through the regulatory process in England and Ireland and have passed rigorous examinations. It gives them a leg up.\u201dKip Levin, president of Betfair US, acknowledged that his company is poised to reap a windfall if sports gambling is legalized in the United States. But he added that over the past eight years Betfair has devoted its efforts, as well as tens of millions of dollars, to become the dominant player in an underrated market in the United States: horse racing.Last year, for example, $3.59 billion was bet online legally in the United States on horse racing, generating roughly $700 million in revenue, according to publicly published data from state racing commissions.That total is four times the $158 million in revenue generated by online casinos, and more than double the $300 million in revenue generated by daily fantasy sports, according to numbers compiled by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a financial research firm.\u201cOur focus is, and has been, on growing horse racing through the television stations, our account wagering and now the exchange,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf sports betting becomes legal in the United States, we are ready and in the position to capitalize on it.\u201dBetfair\u2019s pursuit of gamblers in the United States began here from an office in Silicon Docks, where blue chip tech companies like Google, Facebook, Airbnb, LinkedIn and Twitter have taken root. Its interiors are familiar to start-ups the world over, rows of tabletop desks and blinking computer screens in open-air bullpen fashion.The difference is that not only are the ubiquitous television screens tuned to a never-ending stream of horse races, soccer games and almost every conceivable sporting event that can be bet on, but working alongside the engineers and programmers are seasoned bookies. Among them is Gethin Evans, 37, who started with an odds board and money box at English betting rings at racetracks like Ascot and Cheltenham.To Evans, \u201csmart is the new lucky\u201d is more than just the tag line for Betfair\u2019s American advertising campaign. It is the sum of the lessons that he learned assessing risk, crunching data and bringing it to bear for some of Europe\u2019s leading betting operators.He has been paired with Bart Barden, a product manager who previously worked for divisions of Electronic Arts and Microsoft, to spread the gospel of exchange wagering in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have a cutting edge technology,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou got to anticipate how and why your customers want to use it and then give them all the tools they need to feel comfortable. Gambling is about finding an edge or insight and being able capitalize on it.\u201dIn Betfair\u2019s case, the technology is its exchange wagering platform that allows bettors to set and lock in their wagers at their own odds while also offering bettors midrace options.So far 21 tracks in the United States have allowed their races to be part of the Betfair exchange. Among those races will be those run at the Breeders\u2019 Cup World Championships, which include one of America\u2019s most prestigious and lucrative days of racing. Unlike fixed odds books, which are at the mercy of the outcome of the bets, the exchange takes a fee for processing a transaction.In Ireland, for example, Nyquist, the Kentucky Derby champion, is the 6-5 favorite to win the Haskell at fixed-odds sports books. You either take him or leave him at those odds.In the United States, where parimutuel wagering reigns, bettors are pitted against one another. If Nyquist opens at 6-5 and you bet on him, but so does everyone else, the odds might drop to 2-5 and that is what you are stuck with. If Nyquist wins, instead of getting the $4.40 you counted on, the return is only $2.80 for a $2 bet.On the Betfair exchange, however, a wager can be created by a bettor. For instance, the bettor can bet Nyquist will lose, and seek odds of 4-1. So, if any horse in the field upsets the Kentucky Derby champ, the bettor receives $10. The bettor can also hedge that wager by betting on Nyquist to win if, as the race is being run, it is clear that the colt will not be caught.The exchange platform also offers an automated feature called Cash Out that lets a bettor ensure a profit or mitigate a loss with one click of a smartphone or laptop at any time before the race is over. The feature instantly analyzes the bettor\u2019s market position against all other trades being offered by other bettors.So, if a New Jersey gambler takes Nyqvist to win at 7-5 in and the colt is loose on the lead after six furlongs, the Cash Out feature lets the bettor take a smaller profit before Nyqvist hits the wire, whether the colt ultimately prevails or gets caught in the final jump by a closer.The company has countered concerns that the exchange provides a ripe environment for fixing horse races or sporting matches by entering agreements with various leagues and sports organizations around the world to share information on any unusual betting patterns.In Europe, the exchange\u2019s impact has been dizzying as well as lucrative. Last year, Betfair had 1.7 million customers who made about 1.2 billion bets, an average of 3,287,671 bets a day. But the statistic that gets hearts pounding in American horse racing is the average age of customers on the European exchange: 38 compared with 52, the average age of TVG account holders in the United States. Those bettors, however, are wagering on a variety of sports.\u201cIt goes to the heart of what horse racing wants here: new and younger fans,\u201d said Joe Harper, president and chief executive of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.Exchange wagering has been approved in California, but opposition from the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, as well as some prominent owners, has stalled its implementation.\u201cSomething new is not always met with open arms in the horse racing industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why it is so important that exchange wagering becomes a good experience in New Jersey. It can melt away opposition.\u201d\u201cExchanges bring in new demographics precisely because they offer a low vigorish to the most price sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSabotaging this edge sabotages the exchange\u2019s No. 1 selling point.\u201dThe early returns in New Jersey are encouraging, but company officials concede that American bettors face a steep learning curve. In the first seven weeks of operation in New Jersey, exchange wagering on thoroughbreds was $1,142,228, according to the New Jersey Racing Commission.In a typical seven-week period New Jersey handles about twice that number, $2.4 million, online and by phone.\u201cWe seem to be successful so far in attracting people from beyond the traditional tote pools, and liquidity,\u201d said Bart Barden, director of US Exchange, which is part of Betfair US. \u201cBoth of those bode well as we ramp up our marketing efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His Tiffany tableau of the Last Supper had belonged to a Japanese museum that closed, and his gridded glass panels designed by the architects Louis Sullivan and George Washington Maher came from buildings that were renovated or razed.Mr. Halim has studied how the original artists layered, rippled and painted glass to depict saints and biblical scenes. Religious sayings and names of deceased loved ones are etched and painted on some of the panes; he avoids a practice, common among window dealers and collectors, of removing inscriptions to make the pieces more generic and marketable.When Mr. Halim walks along the museum corridors under construction, he said, \u201cI discover something every day \u2014 beauty has no end.\u201dMr. Halim, a Coptic Christian who grew up in Egypt, moved to the United States in 1968 with around $900 in savings. One of his main motivations for opening the museum, he said, was to give something back to the Chicago area, which welcomed him when he was a poor immigrant.\u201cI am really indebted to this country so much that I cannot forget that,\u201d he said.His collections of antiques have filled several buildings as he has continued to buy while readying the museum.\u201cWe don\u2019t try to stop him \u2014 we just let him be,\u201d his middle daughter, Nefrette Halim, said while stepping around clocks and windows in one of his storage spaces.Mr. Halim\u2019s new gray concrete building, in the midst of low-rise brick apartment blocks, is striped with ribbon windows. Half of its six floors will be devoted to antiques, and the rest will contain terraces, a cafe, museum offices and banquet halls. Stained-glass windows and domes are being installed in the elevator, stairwells and dining rooms. Clocks will not be kept in action, but video monitors will play footage of some of them, with acrobats twirling and birds fluttering.The building is to be rented out for banquets and other events. Mr. Halim hopes to break even or turn a profit on what he described as an investment of \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d in the project.Forgeries of antique clocks and Tiffany windows that he unwittingly purchased in his collecting sprees will also be on display here and there as teaching tools. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to learn \u2014 be careful of the fakes,\u201d he said.The museum, with donations from the photography aficionados Steven Sasson and Robert Shanebrook, bought both packages for a few thousand dollars each.

{"Headline": "Facebook to Add \u2018Secret Conversations\u2019 to Messenger App", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 Two years ago, Messenger, a photo and text messaging service, appeared to be almost an afterthought at Facebook, the social networking giant.On Friday, Facebook said it would also begin testing \u201csecret conversations\u201d inside Messenger, a feature that offers end-to-end encryption on some messages to be read only on the two mobile devices that users are communicating with. While it stops short of the full encryption that other messaging services like WhatsApp have adopted, it gives Messenger a heightened mode of security that Facebook hopes will attract global audiences to download the app.\u201cThe fact that we have 1.65 billion people on Facebook already makes Messenger the best live, self-updating address book in the world,\u201d Mr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of our network, I feel like we really have a shot at this.\u201dThe moves put Facebook Messenger increasingly into competition with messaging apps that have risen to prominence in their particular regions or countries. WeChat, the mobile messaging app owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, dominates China. Kakao, another app, is widely used throughout South Korea, while the Line smartphone app is popular in Japan.\u201cJust look at how successful WeChat has become for Tencent,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson, an internet analyst with eMarketer. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of ubiquity Facebook wants to achieve with Messenger.\u201dEven as Messenger has been drawing new users, it has yet to make money. The app is free to download and Mr. Zuckerberg has said Facebook typically does not try to generate revenue until a service has a billion users.A recent American Express Messenger bot, for instance, may send someone a Facebook message with restaurant recommendations for a city they have recently bought plane tickets to visit using their American Express card. The CNN bot sends news stories based on topics a user is interested in. Airline service bots could handle customer problems in one thread.Some of Messenger\u2019s early bot offerings have been criticized as half-baked and underdeveloped. Facebook said that while early versions of bots may not be as impressive as the hype, more than 21,000 developers have signed up to develop bots since the platform\u2019s introduction.Adding more encryption with secret conversations, which Facebook plans to roll out widely by the end of the summer, is aimed at coaxing people to use the service for more communication. Someone could set a message to disappear after a period of time, which may make them more willing to exchange personal information with a company\u2019s customer service representative on Messenger. People have to opt in to use secret conversations, the company said.To keep Messenger\u2019s momentum going, Mr. Marcus said he expected the fast pace of product releases for the app to continue.\u201cTo make Messenger your preferred and primary communication platform, we have to build capabilities different from anyone else,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo Is a Case Study in Poor Timing", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsYahoo has fittingly closed a portal on tech mergers and acquisitions.The company\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon caps two decades of deals and non-deals that shaped internet history. Yahoo got lucky with Alibaba, but failed to capitalize on its dominance by not acquiring companies like Google, Facebook and eBay. Spurning Microsoft also was a mistake. It is a one-company textbook on timing.Yahoo, the web creation of Jerry Yang and David Filo, captured the popular embrace of the internet back in 1994, and a large chunk of the internet\u2019s value along with it. Its market capitalization once exceeded $140 billion, and it even occupied the exclusive Boardwalk spot in a dot-com edition of the Monopoly board game. It failed, however, to anticipate how technology would supplant human curation of the web.Its overpriced stock was successfully deployed during the heady days of tech mayhem in the 1990s, but put to poor use. It spent $3.6 billion on the web-hosting service GeoCities and another $5.7 billion on the early internet-radio service Broadcast.com. Both services eventually faded away. Yahoo first ignored Google and then quibbled over a price tag that was lower than Broadcast\u2019s. Mark Zuckerberg likewise rejected a $1 billion offer for his fledgling Facebook.Yahoo kept showcasing its inverse Midas touch. The internet-ad auction firm Overture, the photo-sharing service Flickr and other promising start-ups simply were clouded by Yahoo\u2019s miasma.It is exceptionally tough to arrest a tech business in decline. The Alibaba deal, however, gave Yahoo the financial firepower to subsist for longer than it otherwise might have. In 2005, it contributed its own Chinese business and $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba, an investment now worth some $30 billion. The lack of self-awareness by the founders about Yahoo\u2019s faltering health, however, was its downfall. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo torpedoed the generous $45 billion takeover offer in 2008 from a then-panicky Microsoft.In the end, Yahoo may have managed to gin up a frothier auction than it deserved and thus fetched an outsize price from Verizon. It will be little consolation given what might have been. At least Yahoo has left behind a case study in M.&A. that should be of significant value.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "When Yahoo Ruled the Valley: Stories of the Original \u2018Surfers\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Back in the mid-1990s, before Google even existed, the world\u2019s best guides to the internet sat in Silicon Valley cubicles, visiting websites and carefully categorizing them by hand.They were called surfers, and they were a collection of mostly 20-somethings \u2014 including a yoga lover, an ex-banker, a divinity student, a recent college grad from Ohio hungry for adventure \u2014 all hired by a start-up called Yahoo to build a directory of the world\u2019s most interesting websites.Today, with more than one billion websites across the globe, the very notion seems mad. Even then, there was a hint of insanity about the enterprise.Two decades after Yahoo\u2019s founding \u2014 the equivalent of several lifetimes in Silicon Valley \u2014 Elvis still serenades the surfers at the headquarters here in Sunnyvale, and Yahoo is at a crossroads. The company, long since eclipsed by Google and Facebook, now commands just a tiny fraction of people\u2019s attention and advertisers\u2019 dollars.Yahoo is auctioning itself off. Bids are due on Monday, the same day the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is expected to report yet another quarter of dismal financial results.Most, but not all, of the surfers have scattered across Silicon Valley and the world. The careers of some followed the arc of the tech world\u2019s obsessions and idiosyncrasies over the last 20 years. Others took their stock windfalls and dropped out to pursue other passions. Taken together, the surfers, about 10 of whom are still in the building, embody the technological and cultural changes that transformed the valley and the world \u2014 and left Yahoo in the dust.Back in 1994, when the directory was born, search engines were rudimentary and ineffectual. Newbies were just learning how to navigate the World Wide Web. The very idea of a website was novel.Two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, saw opportunity. Working from a trailer on campus, they began compiling websites into a list, organized by topic. They eventually named it Yahoo, an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.It quickly became one of the most important gateways to the web. The value proposition was simple, said one longtime surfer, Dave Sikula: \u201cWe\u2019ve done the work for you \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through the web and these are the best sites.\u201dThat required an army of people, said Srinija Srinivasan, employee No. 5 at Yahoo, who was hired to build the original surfer team.It was serious work, deciding how to label things and where to put them. What do you call a category that includes skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan? What kind of pornography should be considered for inclusion, given that \u201csex\u201d was the most popular search term from the start?Much was left to individual judgment. Matthew Mustapick, who quit a job at Wells Fargo to become a surfer in 1995, recalled creating the \u201ccannibalism\u201d category. He found sites explaining how to butcher a human body but decided they were too distasteful to include.Amey Mathews, who worked as a Yahoo surfer from 1998 to 2002 (and is now married to Mr. Mustapick), discovered in the course of her work that the Irish originally carved their jack-o\u2019-lanterns from turnips, not pumpkins. After that, the surfers held a turnip-carving contest every Halloween.The directory survived until 2014. But by then, most of the surfers\u2019 time already went to other projects. Many of them worked to improve Yahoo\u2019s search engine as it battled with Alphabet\u2019s Google subsidiary. Still, Yahoo\u2019s star continued to fade, particularly with the rise of smartphones and social applications like Facebook and Twitter.Today, some former surfers ponder the company\u2019s fate with sadness and a hint of regret at opportunities missed. \u201cYahoo Mail is still my primary email. My home page is still My Yahoo. I still look at the sports page,\u201d said Mr. Sikula, who is a stage director and freelance editor after being laid off in 2010 as part of a big surfer cutback.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know why the company exists. And I think that\u2019s what they are trying to figure out, too.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t chosen to study Japanese at Stanford, Srinija Srinivasan would never have found herself in charge of building Yahoo\u2019s directory into a guide to the internet for a curious world.Ms. Srinivasan, who grew up in Kansas, was an undergraduate attending a tech-focused Stanford program in Kyoto, Japan, when she got to know two fellow students over shared meals \u2014 Jerry Yang and David Filo. After graduation, she was working on the Cyc Project, an early effort to create artificial intelligence, when the pair asked her to help them turn their directory into a real company.\u201cJerry and David knew that I alphabetized my CDs,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan, 44, said in an interview in her Palo Alto, Calif., home. \u201cMy sock drawer is quite beautiful.\u201dWhen she joined, her business card read Ontological Yahoo, a term reflecting her philosophical approach to the job. \u201cThis is not a perfunctory file-keeping exercise. This is defining the nature of being,\u201d she said. \u201cCategories and classifications are the basis for each of our worldviews. \u201dFaced with the vastness of the web, Yahoo surfers hoped to identify the most complete, relevant or interesting sites on a given subject. To choose which topics to focus on, the surfers relied in part on a daily log of visitors\u2019 top queries.Once in a while, surfers made mistakes. For instance, they initially categorized Messianic Judaism as a Jewish sect, failing to notice that its adherents, who follow many Jewish traditions, believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, a defining trait of Christians. \u201cWe had faxes coming in nonstop from rabbis,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said.Yahoo also offered automated search tools by teaming up with various companies, including AltaVista and Google. Eventually, though, Yahoo realized that it had to develop its own version of the technology.Human judgment \u2014 what Mr. Yang referred to as \u201cthe voice of Yahoo\u201d \u2014 remained a core value of the company. When the Grateful Dead musician Jerry Garcia died in August 1995, Yahoo searches on him spiked immediately. The surfers put a Garcia link on the home page. \u201cThat was the birth of Yahoo News,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said. Today, it remains one of the most popular online news portals.The surfers\u2019 role as corporate conscience expanded with the company. They worked on a child-safe version of Yahoo, called Yahooligans. They selected the news headlines worthy of home-page display. Over time, Ms. Srinivasan and her team even fielded questions like how much cleavage to allow on home-page ads.Despite its efforts, Yahoo kept losing ground to Google in search. Microsoft made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy the weakened company in 2008. Ms. Srinivasan left two years later, soon after Mr. Yang stepped down as chief executive. \u201cIn Japan, they have a saying: Leave when the cherry blossoms are full,\u201d she said.She also sits on the board of trustees of her alma mater, Stanford, a school that has churned out several generations of Silicon Valley moguls. But unlike many former technology executives, Ms. Srinivasan focuses her attention there on the arts and humanities.\u201cTech is sexy. It\u2019s employable. Parents love it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that isn\u2019t worth a hill of beans unless we know why, to what end. We call it the humanities for a reason.\u201dYahoo, like the early web itself, was largely focused on American content. But it had global ambitions. Seana Meek, an Alberta native and a single mother, was working for Futurekids, which taught children computer basics, when Yahoo hired her to organize the Canadian sites in its directory.For Ms. Meek personally, it kicked off a 20-year career odyssey through modern Silicon Valley and some of the tech industry\u2019s most significant trends: e-commerce, virtual reality, fraud-fighting \u2014 even a mobile haircut app.When she started, Yahoo was fumbling in Canada. Technically, it had a separate Canada site, but it relied on the American directory for its searches.Employees asked her why the most popular search term among Canadian users was the word Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d Ms. Meek, 41, recalled saying. \u201cIn Canada, you do \u2018government\u2019 and you get American results. So you do \u2018government Canada.\u2019 You do anything and then you add \u2018Canada\u2019 to it.\u201dAfter the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Yahoo\u2019s dysfunctions began to surface. In 2002, the company transferred Ms. Meek\u2019s job to Toronto. Less than 90 days later, it closed that office and sent her and two engineers back to the American headquarters.She got a promotion from the mess: Yahoo put her in charge of the content, ads and business deals for Yahoo Canada. She was nicknamed Captain Canada and had a ringside seat to one of the company\u2019s biggest decisions \u2014 dumping Google as a search partner and switching to technology from its Inktomi acquisition instead. \u201cThey were scared to do it. So they did it in Canada first,\u201d she said.In 2008, she left the company, embarking on a journey through Silicon Valley\u2019s laboratory of business ideas, big and small. First she joined a tiny start-up, Picateers, that was trying to reinvent the school portrait business. It folded a year later.From there she went to Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, the tech industry\u2019s first big foray into virtual reality. Players interacted with one another online in a 3-D simulated world, where they could buy and sell things, make friends, or just gawk at the scenery.Second Life was an extraordinary experiment in human behavior, she said. An employee could change something in the virtual world, then just watch what happened. \u201cYou are literally a god,\u201d she said.Next for her was Eventbrite, an online event-planning and ticketing company. There she worked to protect against credit card fraud.And she says, she is casting about for the next challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny time in my life where there is definitely no script,\u201d she said.Working long hours in close quarters, it was inevitable that some surfers would find romance.For Matthew Mustapick and Amey Mathews, working at Yahoo didn\u2019t just lead to love. The lessons they learned \u2014 and the money they made from the stock they received as early employees \u2014 allowed them to achieve a different kind of Silicon Valley dream: dropping out of tech to do their own thing.Ms. Mathews, who had a fine arts degree from Stanford, joined in 1998 after responding to an ad looking for a speaker of Scandinavian languages. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t speak any Scandinavian languages \u2014 but I speak Italian and you should have someone who speaks Italian,\u201d she recalled during an interview at the couple\u2019s home in Soquel, Calif.Yahoo had an Italian speaker already, but she got a job anyway. Mr. Mustapick sat in a nearby cubicle, and they eventually became a couple.Surfers were free to reflect their personal interests in the directory. Ms. Mathews loved animals and indexed all the dogs, cattle, even miniature donkeys, she could find. Mr. Mustapick was fond of cataloging oddities like prosthetic testicles for pets that had been neutered.Mr. Mustapick left Yahoo in early 2002. Ms. Mathews followed later that year.\u201cI could afford to lose money for a whole year when no one came to my class,\u201d she said.Mr. Mustapick turned toward music. \u201cI always wanted to learn how to play electric guitar like Scott Henderson,\u201d he said, referring to the jazz and blues guitarist. That interest led him in an unexpected direction \u2014 he began building acoustic guitars with an eye toward selling them.Having looked at hundreds of thousands of websites while at Yahoo, he had a good sense of how to market online, well before the era of Twitter and self-promotion as a national pastime. He built a website and posted photos of guitars he was building so customers could watch the progress.And he consciously befriended the right people. \u201cThey just put the word out for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the sort of thing I learned at Yahoo that you could do.\u201dStill, she remembers Yahoo fondly. \u201cI loved being around that many smart, interesting, engaged people,\u201d she said. \u201cI actively miss that in my daily life \u2014 not enough to go get a job and give up what I\u2019m doing, but I do miss it.\u201dNine years ago, Gordon Hurd quit Yahoo for the second time. In June, he began working for the company again \u2014 Round 3 \u2014 this time as a freelance writer.In the intervening years, Mr. Hurd toured the struggling new-media landscape \u2014 first, the Yahoo archrival AOL; then, Interactive One, a network of black news and culture sites; later, First Look Media, created by the eBay founder Pierre M. Omidyar; and most recently, a men\u2019s fashion site, Man\u2019s Life. There was even a brief stint at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm and \u201cthe most corporate place you could go,\u201d he said.Mr. Hurd\u2019s first run with Yahoo started in 1998 when he was hired to organize the business and finance parts of the directory. The starting pay was only $35,000 a year, he recalled. But there were stock options.\u201cI didn\u2019t make millions by any means,\u201d said Mr. Hurd, 45, in a phone interview from Brooklyn, where he lives. But he bought a house.A restless soul, he left Yahoo in 2002 to become an investigative reporter for a local magazine. Less than a year later, with a second child on the way, Mr. Hurd returned to Yahoo, eventually helping run the influential home page.In 2007, he hopped to McKinsey and then quickly to AOL, where he ran Asylum.com, a lifestyle site aimed at men age 18 to 34. The business model was to create vast amounts of content in the hope that visitors would click on ads.That didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWhat it underlined is how much of a commodity content was,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. Asylum was shut down.Mr. Hurd moved on to Interactive One, the digital arm of Radio One, the largest black-owned radio broadcaster in the United States, which struggled to crack the content code, too. Volume trumped quality. \u201cYou know people will click on a subway-fight video, but you want to talk about what it\u2019s like to be a millennial of color,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.Which is how, today, Mr. Hurd is back at Yahoo, writing articles for its style site while he ponders his next move.More than ever, he thinks there is a need for the type of work that Yahoo\u2019s surfers did 20 years ago. \u201cThe web has gotten so big that you need people to curate it,\u201d he said.However, he sees that curation coming from subject experts, not mass-audience sites like Yahoo. Niche sites with a devoted following could work with select sponsors hoping to reach a particular audience, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019s really dedicated to the art of handmade knives, and you set out to categorize the sites of handmade knives, only you can do that. Google can never do that,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.When Becky Uline graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio in 1996, she didn\u2019t really know what she wanted to do with her life. A friend was raving that he had discovered paradise \u2014 living in Northern California and working for a company few people had ever heard of, Yahoo.She and another Bowling Green graduate, Michelle Heimburger, thought it would be a grand adventure. They both got hired as surfers and rented an apartment together.The building was so empty at first that surfers would zip through it on in-line skates. \u201cWe would sleep under our desks,\u201d Ms. Uline, 42, recalled during an interview at her current home in Oakland, Calif.In 2001, Ms. Uline gave her notice. She wanted to travel the world, financed in part by her Yahoo nest egg.Paris became a favorite haunt. \u201cI would sublet my apartment out for a few months and just go and work from wherever,\u201d she said. She freelanced for Yahoo and also tapped the vast network of surfer alumni, landing work at the visual-search start-up SearchMe and elsewhere.Yahoo\u2019s decline is sad, Ms. Uline said, but she still feels a connection. Her closest friends are former Yahoos, including Ms. Heimburger, who married yet another surfer and lives in London.A few months ago, Ms. Uline, said, she dropped Yahoo as her home page, but she missed it and changed it back. \u201cI still use Yahoo search. I want them to get the revenue,\u201d she said.When Yahoo set out to hire surfers, it invented a new job category. The closest match may have been bookstore clerk \u2014 and Kepler\u2019s Books in nearby Menlo Park turned into a recruitment hotbed. About a dozen surfers were hired away from the shop, including ConnieAlice Hungate.Ms. Hungate, 46, is still at Yahoo more than 18 years later, supervising what remains of the surfer team. She said the group, renamed content analysis and management, is still vital to the company\u2019s ambitions to remain a player in web search.Search ads bring in nearly half of Yahoo\u2019s revenue. Under a 2010 deal with Microsoft, Yahoo uses Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine for most basic queries and ads.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, has devoted vast resources to search technology \u2014 particularly on mobile devices \u2014 in an attempt to leapfrog Google, though the company has little to show for it so far.Ms. Hungate said her team helped train Yahoo\u2019s search algorithms to provide more relevant results. The mobile search app, for example, now automatically pulls up suggestions for nearby places to eat when lunchtime rolls around.The Elvis sculpture, a 1998 gift from a Yahoo user, still watches over the department, and the turnip-carving contest is held every Halloween \u2014 with results posted on Flickr, the photo-sharing service owned by Yahoo.Ms. Hungate said she was not worried about what would happen to the surfers if the company was sold. \u201cInformation management is a core need in technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll adapt.\u201dAdvertisement"}
