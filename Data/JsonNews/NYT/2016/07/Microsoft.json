{"Headline": "They Promised Us Jet Packs. They Promised the Bosses Profit.", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byIf the project had been successful \u2014 and this was always a big if \u2014 it would have changed the definition of green energy and potentially undercut some of the most important industries in the world, not least the oil business. But after two years of trying, and an undisclosed research budget, Foghorn died during a January staff meeting.The result: Everyone on the team received a bonus (they won\u2019t say how much).X, formerly called Google X, cheekily refers to itself as \u201cthe moonshot factory.\u201d They are the people behind Google\u2019s self-driving car, along with various out-there projects like Loon, an attempt to beam internet access from stratospheric balloons, and Wing, a drone delivery service. Those efforts sit atop dozens of aborted projects \u2014 some just ideas, others that consumed years \u2014 like a never built jet pack and giant blimps that would haul cargo with the same efficiency as an ocean liner.What all these efforts have in common, besides imaginative power, is that they do not make any money. X\u2019s budget and head count are a secret, but shareholders\u2019 perceptions about the division were aptly summed up by a poster board in its Mountain View, Calif., offices. It had a picture of a burning $100 bill followed by, \u201cInvestors think we do this.\u201dThat poster points to a central question for both X and Alphabet: What exactly is X\u2019s business? And how does a public company invest in such speculative ideas, most of which will never work, without irritating investors or wasting a ton of money?Building a research division is an old and often unsuccessful concept. For decades, corporate giants like AT&T, IBM, Microsoft and Xerox have tried, in varying ways, to organize research-oriented groups in hopes of finding ways to cash in on emerging technologies before their competitors.Those efforts played a role in creating some of the 20th century\u2019s most significant innovations. For instance, Bell Labs, then a division of AT&T, invented the transistor, the foundation of modern electronics. But in many cases these research arms did little for the companies that financed them.Xerox pioneered the graphical interface for computers \u2014 the idea that people could navigate with a mouse rather than typing obscure commands on a screen. But it was a young company named Apple that turned that idea into a giant business.\u201cIn general, the model of having a central research lab that the corporation funds for research into new technologies has not produced much for these companies,\u201d said G. Pascal Zachary, a professor at the Arizona State University School for the Future of Innovation in Society. \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t see many of the successful young companies today thinking about building them.\u201dX is trying to make corporate research systematic by borrowing working ideas from the past, while adding a few wrinkles \u2014 like giving people a financial incentive to admit when something is not working out \u2014 in hopes of not making the same mistakes.This effort comes at a time when Alphabet is trying to enforce financial discipline over a broad empire that was famous for not worrying about nickels and dimes.Next month will be the first anniversary of Google\u2019s surprise announcement that it would remake itself as a holding company. All the ad-driven and highly profitable businesses like search would still be called Google. The assumption was that the other divisions would have to prove they could stand on their own financially \u2014 at least over time.While investors still do not know X\u2019s budget, they at least have a sense of the limits. In the first quarter, Alphabet lost about $800 million on what it called \u201cother bets\u201d \u2014 everything outside Google\u2019s core search and advertising businesses \u2014 and it will update the figure when it reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday.At the same time, now that X is spinning off new companies that will either stand on their own or die, investors are getting something of a yardstick to judge the division\u2019s progress. If one of those new companies starts to rival search advertising as a revenue stream, X will be considered a success. If that never happens, it will be a failure (and not the good kind).For instance, X\u2019s self-driving car project, known internally as Chauffeur, recently hired a chief executive and is poised to become a stand-alone company. Another, called Verily, is a life sciences company that has developed, among other things, a glucose-sensing contact lens for people with diabetes, and has licensed that technology to Novartis. Verily became its own company shortly after Google announced the Alphabet reorganization.\u201cThe thing we created \u2014 our product \u2014 was Verily, and at the highest level we are being paid as an organization to do that somewhat regularly,\u201d said Astro Teller, X\u2019s chief executive, though his actual title is \u201ccaptain of moonshots.\u201d \u201cI would not want to promise anyone internally or externally that we\u2019re going to do it once a year.\u201dThere are two main differences between X and the corporate research arms of the past. While operations like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC worked on problems that were at least nominally related to their parent companies\u2019 core businesses, X employees can work on anything they like. In fact, they are discouraged from straying into Google\u2019s main business because Google has its own research group that focuses on machine learning and other computer science topics.And while Bell Labs and others made huge contributions to basic, university-style research, X projects are conceived as moneymaking enterprises, or things that at least seem as if they could make money sometime in the next few years. With Foghorn, the goal was to turn seawater into gasoline for no more than $5 a gallon \u2014 enough that it could conceivably find a market in some European nations where high taxes make gasoline more costly.Kathy Cooper, an engineer who led the project, said of the goal, \u201cI think we could meet it, but it would be more like 15 to 20 years.\u201d That was too far away, which was why she recommended killing it.X employees avoid talking about money, but it is not a subject they can ignore. They face financial barriers that can shut down a project if it does not pan out as quickly as planned. And they have to meet various milestones before they can hire more people for their teams.The point, several executives said, is to encourage employees to think big while staying away from creating technology for technology\u2019s sake.\u201cIf you actually want to make the world better, focus on what would actually make the world better, and the technology will take care of itself,\u201d Mr. Teller said. In other words, great ideas that solve real problems will bring in real money.One of the more public examples was a recent overhaul of a Google robotics effort whose best-known project is a robotic cheetah. The division was recently dismantled, and its disparate technologies are being re-evaluated so they can either be sold off or streamlined for a specific moonshot idea, like \u201cbuild a car that can drive itself.\u201dOver the last year, X has hardened project milestones and created an intermediate step, called Foundry. The group\u2019s leader, Obi Felten, said her job was to hone new technologies into a concrete product and to work with engineers like Ms. Cooper to help them write business plans.The idea is to create a conveyor-belt-like process that encourages employees to quickly jettison projects that seem unlikely to work and to avoid technologies that are neat ideas but would never make money.One of the best ways to save money, Mr. Teller said, is to encourage employees to kill projects before they become expensive \u2014 hence the bonus for the Foghorn team. X staff meetings begin with a \u201cpremortem\u201d process in which people predict how various technologies might fall short. Employees\u2019 laptops are decorated with stickers of crumpled-up paper that represent the end of past efforts.When Mr. Teller speaks at events like South by Southwest and TED, he ruminates so deeply on the word \u201cfail\u201d that successes are sometimes framed as \u201cfailing to fail.\u201dThe idea of celebrating failure is a Silicon Valley clich\u00e9, but Mr. Teller talks about it in the practical terms of a management consultant. Say you have a team of 20 people working on a project that is not going anywhere, he said in a recent interview. In a year those 20 people will be 30 people. The company has to pay their salaries and health insurance, and the team will inevitably hire a few consultants. Worse, they will have wasted a year.How much money could the company save if you could get them to cut bait a year earlier?\u201cThat\u2019s the magic,\u201d Mr. Teller said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do it. They will not raise their hands and say, \u2018This project is just not what we should be working on,\u2019 unless you start bonusing them, unless they can get a promotion for ending their project.\u201dFailure bonuses are also an example of how X, which was set up independent of Google from the outset, is a leading indicator of sorts for how the autonomous Alphabet could work. In Alphabet, employees who do not work for Mother Google are supposed to have their financial futures tied to their own company instead of Google\u2019s search ads. At X, that means killing things before they become too expensive.Mr. Teller\u2019s decision to start paying bonuses to employees who kill their own projects happened long before the Alphabet transition, and it was met with skepticism from Google\u2019s chief culture officer. Mr. Teller got what he wanted anyway.\u201cThey were just offended by the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we don\u2019t even talk about it anymore.\u201dX was founded in 2010, and it was originally in a brick building on the edge of Google\u2019s main campus. At the beginning, it felt like an extended 20 percent project \u2014 the extra projects Google employees are encouraged to work on outside of their main job \u2014 with little in the way of process.Former Google employees said this led to a temptation to overhype projects long before they were ready. The most notorious example of this was Google Glass, the much maligned computer glasses.The glasses were supposed to have a marketing scheme to match, and X employees hatched an idea for floating showrooms. Later, when mysterious barges showed up in Portland, Me., and San Francisco Bay, they kicked off months of speculation and conspiracy theories until finally they were towed away without a word from Google.Mr. Teller said he shut down the barges idea the first day it was his decision to make. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of agonizing about that,\u201d he said.Today, the company\u2019s offices are a few miles from Google\u2019s main campus. They are full of electric vehicles and people riding skateboardlike contraptions. Mr. Teller appears to be always on Rollerblades.Beyond the main lobby and offices, behind key-card-protected doors, sit various labs, as well as an open warehouse floor that houses a division called the Design Kitchen, which appears to be a cross between a machine shop and a cool dad\u2019s garage. Some items spotted on a recent tour included climbing rope; lots of tools; oversize plugs; a set of skateboard wheels attached to a block, wires and a 9-volt battery; a plastic ear; and beer.Unlike Google, where software engineers are kings, X is run by an eclectic batch of scientists and tinkerers whose backgrounds range from math, physics and chemistry to design, fashion and public art. The line \u201cI\u2019m not an engineer\u201d seems to be a point of pride. Rich DeVaul, who heads a \u201crapid evaluation\u201d team whose job is to hatch and kill ideas in short order, guessed that fewer than half the employees have engineering degrees (he doesn\u2019t).\u201cI would argue that the great strength of X, in fact, is that basically we aren\u2019t just a bunch of techies,\u201d he said.The combination of big ideas, lofty rhetoric and a strict code of secrecy has made X a source of endless speculation and conspiracy theories. The one you hear most frequently, usually from competitors and venture capitalists, is that X is a giant public relations plan to distract regulators from Google\u2019s search business, which is under scrutiny around the world.Cynical though that sounds, it points to something that seems fundamentally true: Many of history\u2019s great corporate research efforts, like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, have come from companies that were monopolies or close to it.Failure bonuses notwithstanding, no normal person would walk away from X thinking it looked frugal. There is a free cafeteria whose recent menu included sushi and pork tri-tip. The bathrooms have Japanese toilet seats with buttons for warmth and spritz. Listening to X executives talk about saving money is a bit like having billionaires tell you they built a $30 million house for $30 million and not a penny more.But X\u2019s success will be less about money saved than the creation of a new Google-size business whose profits wash away all the losses. And while the division has already had some successes, it has yet to produce the \u201cmoonshot\u201d Mr. Teller is hoping for.Arguably the biggest success, Google Brain, is the one people know the least about. It was an artificial intelligence effort that was spun back into core Google in 2012 and is now embedded in products like voice search and the Google Photos app, in which users can search their albums for images like \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmountains.\u201dInvestors would prefer a shiny new business that does not rely on advertising. Mr. DeVaul hopes that if X can deliver a big hit, it will encourage other companies to copy the entire concept. Management science is a lot less interesting than moonshots, but until X hits the moon, that is what it is selling.\u201cWe could have five or 10 other world-class organizations doing this, and we would not be able to scratch the surface of the crazy big hard challenges out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist: I believe that there is an endless supply of huge problems affecting humanity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taser International Dominates the Police Body Camera Market", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byWhen Micah Johnson went on a deadly shooting rampage in Dallas last week, body cameras worn by police officers were rolling, capturing at least 170 hours of video of the mayhem.That footage is now stored on a sophisticated cloud computing system that lets police manage digital evidence and hosts more hours of video than Netflix has available to stream.These paired offerings \u2014 body cameras for police and cloud storage \u2014 have transformed policing in recent years, adding a new level of transparency and accountability but also raising questions about privacy and who has the right to view those videos.Behind the scenes, one company is at the center of it all: Taser International. Best known for making Taser stun guns, it controls about three-quarters of the body camera business in the United States.Until recently a one-note provider of electrical weapons, Taser has swiftly cornered the market for body cameras and related software, making it one of the most important suppliers of technology to law enforcement today.Its Axon body cameras are worn by officers in dozens of big cities including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington and, yes, Dallas. And using computing power from Microsoft and Amazon, Taser runs Evidence.com, the site that lets police host and manage body camera video.Demand for the products has soared in the two years since Michael Brown was shot dead by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., and analysts now estimate that the market will soon be worth $1 billion a year.\u201cWhen the rest of us are snapping pictures and videos, police can\u2019t pull out a note pad and start writing,\u201d said Patrick W. Smith, the chief executive of Taser. \u201cThere\u2019s now an expectation from society that they\u2019re getting good documentation of what they\u2019re involved in. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to know what happened.\u201dMr. Smith and his brother, Thomas, founded Taser in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1993, and the company now is worth about $1.3 billion. Taser cameras have captured thousands of altercations between the police and the public and several controversial police shootings, including ones in Albuquerque and Cincinnati.Yet as Taser works to sell cameras and software to more departments, it is coming under fire for questionable business practices. In some instances, it has paid police chiefs to travel to Taser conferences. In other cases, chiefs who have bought Taser products have joined the company as consultants shortly after leaving public service. And several cities have awarded contracts to Taser without competitive bidding.So far, these issues have done little to blunt Taser\u2019s momentum. Last quarter, for the first time, Taser booked more sales for body cameras and related software than it did for its stun guns.Interest in body cameras was already picking up two years ago, as police departments around the country started responding to calls for greater accountability. Then, in August 2014, a white police officer killed Mr. Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson. The officer was not wearing a body camera, and witnesses disputed his account of the altercation that led to the shooting. The officer was not charged, and critics said that had he been wearing a body camera, the outcome might have been different.At times, the video can exonerate officers. In 2009, shortly after Taser began selling its cameras through its Axon division, Sgt. Brandon Davis shot and killed a man in Fort Smith, Ark. Video recorded by his body camera captured the shooting, and Mr. Davis was cleared of wrongdoing.In other instances, the footage can portray police as needlessly aggressive. In 2014, a Taser Axon camera worn by an officer in Albuquerque captured the fatal shooting of a homeless man by officers who did not appear to be threatened. The two officers have been charged with second-degree murder and are expected to stand trial soon.Even when body cameras are worn, they are not always effective. When two police officers fatally shot Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., on July 5, they were wearing body cameras made by a Taser competitor. A police spokesman said the cameras became dislodged during the altercation with Mr. Sterling, and the video was unlikely to reveal much; Baton Rouge is making a transition to Taser cameras.In another incident last week, the officer who killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn., was not wearing a body camera. But Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live.\u201cThe whole world wants to know what the heck happened in the moments leading up to that shooting,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Taser. \u201cWould a body camera have changed the behavior? Maybe. But it sure would have answered some questions.\u201dJust a few years ago, many police were reluctant to wear body cameras, fearing that their every action would be scrutinized.\u201cThere was a real hesitation at first,\u201d said Officer Jeff Garwacki, who oversees the body camera program at the Fort Worth Police Department.But as the devices have become more common, many police officers have come to rely on them. In Fort Worth, which has bought 800 body cameras from Taser and uses its Evidence.com service, Mr. Garwacki said most officers wanted to wear cameras at all times. \u201cThe body cameras are showing that the officers are doing what they say they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen police use body cameras and tell people that they are using them, it tends to produce better behavior by both the police and the public,\u201d said Chad Marlow, advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.Yet Mr. Marlow expressed concern that Taser had achieved such dominance in the body camera industry so quickly.\u201cThe fact that a lot of police departments are familiar with Taser has created an inclination to go with them,\u201d said Mr. Marlow. \u201cOther companies are not getting the opportunity to show off their products.\u201dSome of Taser\u2019s rivals, Mr. Marlow said, were developing software that made it easier to redact identifying features of people captured on camera, better protecting their privacy.There is no doubt that Taser has managed to use its longstanding relationships with police departments, which have used the company\u2019s stun guns for decades, to gain its early lead in the market for body cameras and related software.But several competitors, and some city officials, accuse the company of cozying up to police chiefs to secure lucrative contracts. Nearly all of the roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States have bought Taser\u2019s stun guns. \u201cTaser is very much intertwined with police departments,\u201d said Mark Strouse, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.In several instances around the country, Taser has either paid for the travel of police chiefs who went on to award the company contracts, or hired recently retired chiefs who had awarded Taser contracts.\u201cWe think there\u2019s an ongoing pattern of police chiefs getting lucrative consulting contracts after they retire, if they give Taser contracts,\u201d said Robert McKeeman, chief executive of Utility, which makes a rival body camera.Taser defended its sales tactics, saying they were commonplace, and said that many police departments were familiar with the company. It now makes law enforcement officials wait a year after leaving government service before it will hire them as consultants. Taser also said that while it was sometimes awarded sole-source bids, the departments doing the purchasing have often run a competitive process to test other cameras.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to solve customers\u2019 needs, you have to have close relationships,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything that was misleading.\u201dThe company struggled for several years. Ill-fated brand extensions like the Auto Taser, a device that electrified steering wheels to prevent car theft, nearly bankrupted the company.But sales picked up when Taser introduced a powerful electrical weapon, the M26, which resembled a handgun. Taser went public in 2001.The company began selling video recorders that worked with Taser weapons in 2006, and it introduced its first body camera, the Axon Pro, in 2009.Mr. Smith predicted that sales of Axon cameras and Evidence.com would soon dwarf sales of Taser\u2019s weapons, and that the company would one day be renamed to reflect the growing prominence of its body camera business.\u201cWe had a very successful business selling Taser weapons,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bull Market Blues", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe answer, I\u2019d suggest, isn\u2019t entirely positive. In fact, in some ways the stock market\u2019s gains reflect economic weaknesses, not strengths. And understanding how that works may help us make sense of the troubling state our economy is in.The truth, in any case, is that there are three big points of slippage between stock prices and the success of the economy in general. First, stock prices reflect profits, not overall incomes. Second, they also reflect the availability of other investment opportunities \u2014 or the lack thereof. Finally, the relationship between stock prices and real investment that expands the economy\u2019s capacity has gotten very tenuous.On the first point: We measure the economy\u2019s success by the extent to which it generates rising incomes for the population. But stocks don\u2019t reflect incomes in general; they only reflect the part of income that shows up as profits.On the second point: When investors buy stocks, they\u2019re buying a share of future profits. What that\u2019s worth to them depends on what other options they have for converting money today into income tomorrow. And these days those options are pretty poor, with interest rates on long-term government bonds not only very low by historical standards but zero or negative once you adjust for inflation. So investors are willing to pay a lot for future income, hence high stock prices for any given level of profits.This may seem, however, to present a paradox. If the private sector doesn\u2019t see itself as having a lot of good investment opportunities, how can profits be so high? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that these days profits often seem to bear little relationship to investment in new capacity. Instead, profits come from some kind of market power \u2014 brand position, the advantages of an established network, or good old-fashioned monopoly. And companies making profits from such power can simultaneously have high stock prices and little reason to spend.In other words, while record stock prices do put the lie to claims that the Obama administration has been anti-business, they\u2019re not evidence of a healthy economy. If anything, they\u2019re a sign of an economy with too few opportunities for productive investment and too much monopoly power.So when you read headlines about stock prices, remember: What\u2019s good for the Dow isn\u2019t necessarily good for America, or vice versa.Advertisement"}

This was working perfectly, sort of; I lost the first 20 or so points,  but he was starting to look a bit exasperated.   At  one point, after retrieving one of my errant shots, I thought I saw him clutch at his lower back a bit like I might have aggravated an old injury.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.A big part of what has made Amazon\u2019s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon\u2019s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers \u2014 the warehouses from which it processes customer orders \u2014 in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year.Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon.\u201cI would not take our financial results as an indication we\u2019re running out of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to really prove out their profitability,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Amazon\u2019s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results.The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business.The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing.Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google.Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company\u2019s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.The company\u2019s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\u201cThey are defying the laws of gravity,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt shows their level of market share gains is increasing.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings misstated the number of consecutive quarters in which Amazon has shown a record profit.

{"Headline": "Google Races to Catch Up in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byBitsWhen it comes to cloud computing, Google is in a very unfamiliar position: seriously behind.\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest maker of computer servers is making machines just for these guys,\u201d said John Lovelock, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt\u2019s the nexus of things like big data, social networks and mobility, and the next big thing, which is artificial intelligence.\u201dFor Google, a loss in cloud computing would be a rare misstep for a company that revolutionized media with its advertising business, and then made the world\u2019s leading smartphone operating system.A victory for Google, however, could change how we work, turning advanced computing into an everyday utility that we use to run factories, interact in virtual reality or read one another\u2019s emotions. Given Google\u2019s track record, it\u2019s worth considering the prospect.But it will be an uphill climb.Google is moving rapidly to change things. Three announcements it made last week show how it hopes to gain ground on Amazon Web Services and Azure.First, the company said it has used artificial intelligence to cut the power use in its data centers 15 percent, a huge decrease considering how efficient these data factories were already.Power is probably the largest single cost for all three of the cloud companies. Google is almost certain to use its savings to reduce prices, much the way it won in search advertising by figuring out its competitors\u2019 costs, then undercutting them.\u201cThis certainly gives Google an edge,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people focused on narrow problems. We\u2019ve focused on the widest possible problem.\u201dGoogle also released for public use ways to transcribe and analyze recorded speech for things like meaning, emotional content and whether a speaker was happy or sad. An outside company that worked on the project \u2014 Google would not say which one \u2014 used it to analyze over two billion minutes of customer service calls. It works in 80 languages, Google said.At the same time, the company moved its customers on the United States West Coast from a data center in Iowa to facilities in Oregon. Google\u2019s network, which it claims is larger than the internet, can send the equivalent of 375 hours of video a second.A move like that only makes sense when a company wants to offer the kind of split-second performance needed for virtual reality or instantaneous customer interactions over networks of cellphones and sensors.Can faster networks, lower prices and lots of artificial intelligence put Google ahead? Amazon\u2019s lead seems to give it an edge for at least the next couple of years, as its cloud branch has perfected a method of developing hundreds of new cloud features annually. Yet while the company appears to have some basic artificial intelligence features, called machine learning, it seems to have little in the way of speech recognition or translation.Mr. Lovelock, the Gartner analyst, predicted that Google would offer businesses the insights it has gained from years of watching people online. \u201cAmazon views the customer as the person paying the bill, while Google believes the customer is the end user of a service,\u201d he said. And Microsoft is promoting itself as the company that has products customers already know and use.\u201cEveryone has to play to the strengths the market already sees they have,\u201d Mr. Lovelock said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Valuation Quirks Help End Proposed Polycom-Mitel Merger", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsOverpriced Silicon Valley unicorns are not the only technology-sector valuation oddities. Polycom, a struggling videoconferencing company, and its Canadian rival Mitel Networks just created one by scrapping their merger deal.Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management originally played matchmaker. Last October, the activist hedge fund bought stakes in Polycom and Mitel and urged them to unite. With Polycom as buyer, Elliott reckoned the stock would more than double in a couple of years. About six months later, the idea came to fruition, albeit with the smaller Mitel acquiring Polycom for $2 billion.The cash-and-stock deal offered a 22 percent premium to Polycom shareholders, who also would have owned three-fifths of the enlarged entity. An anticipated $160 million of annual synergies, worth some $1.3 billion once taxed and capitalized, should have foretold plenty of upside.Even so, as often happens with technology companies generating little or no growth, investors were unimpressed. Polycom\u2019s revenue had tumbled 10 percent and its operating income by a third since 2011. Mitel lost money in each of the last three years. Both are under threat from larger competitors such as Cisco as well as from new workplace communication tools offered by the likes of Facebook and Slack.With the deal worth 20 percent less than when it was struck, Polycom last week decided to abandon it in favor of an all-cash offer from the private equity firm Siris Capital. The price is 9 percent lower per share than the original Mitel bid, and Siris will keep all the benefits of any savings. Yet shares of both public companies rose on the news. Though part of that was because of investors who bet on the deal\u2019s prospects unwinding their positions, the episode exemplifies the strange prism through which investors see tech opportunities.In addition to the riches heaped on fast-growing start-ups like Uber, Microsoft can pay a 50 percent premium to buy a weakening but hyped LinkedIn for $26 billion, promise no synergies and still receive a warm reception from the market. A company like Polycom, with dubious prospects, is rewarded more generously for facing its struggles in private than embarking on a money-saving merger with another public company. The same logic used to build tech products doesn\u2019t always get applied when valuing them.An earlier version of the headline on this article misspelled the name of one of the prospective merger partners. It is Polycom, not Ploycom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Wins Appeal on Overseas Data Searches", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byFor the last few years, American technology giants have been embroiled in a power struggle with the United States government over when authorities get to see and use the digital data that the companies collect.On Thursday, Microsoft won a surprise victory in one such legal battle against the government over access to data that is stored outside the United States.Had the United States government prevailed, Microsoft and others warned, it would set a dangerous precedent that would make it increasingly difficult to resist orders from foreign courts demanding data, such as email from human rights activists or political dissidents. Corporate and government customers abroad also might be unwilling to use cloud services from Microsoft if they thought their data could be seized by American courts, Microsoft said.The Justice Department, which brought the case, had argued that Microsoft\u2019s status as a company based in the United States gave it authority to obtain its data, even if the data was stored outside the country.On Thursday, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said the court\u2019s ruling was a victory for digital privacy rights. He added that the adoption of cloud services by customers in some countries, especially in the public sector, had slowed as a result of the uncertainty around the privacy of their communications.\u201cWe\u2019ve all been worrying about a lack of confidence that people in other countries had when it came to using U.S. cloud services because of their concern the U.S. government would try to reach into their borders,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is, I think, very important in bolstering confidence for our customers around the world.\u201dThe government is likely to appeal the ruling, legal experts said. In a statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said, \u201cWe are disappointed with the court\u2019s decision and are considering our options.\u201dWhatever path the case ends up taking, Thursday\u2019s decision has big implications for other tech companies like Apple and Amazon, both of which supported Microsoft\u2019s position in the case. The behemoths can use the ruling to argue against future attempts by governments to obtain communications beyond their borders.\u201cThe tech community is breathing a collective sigh of relief,\u201d said Craig A. Newman, a lawyer with Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler. \u201cUntil this ruling, tech companies with data centers outside the U.S. were stuck in this proverbial rock and a hard place.\u201d\u201cThree decades ago, international boundaries were not so routinely crossed as they are today, when service providers rely on worldwide networks of hardware to satisfy users\u2019 21st\u2013century demands for access and speed and their related, evolving expectations of privacy,\u201d the court wrote in its decision.The office of the Irish Data Commissioner, which sets online privacy rules in Ireland, did not respond to a request for comment.Digital rights groups praised the decision and joined Microsoft and other technology companies in calling on Congress to modernize laws on electronic communications.\u201cThis is a significant decision and yet another reminder that the laws that protect our privacy online are dangerously out of date,\u201d said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cAs the concurring opinion points out, our online privacy laws are not the bulwarks of privacy that Congress thought they were when it enacted them in 1986.\u201dThe decision caught some people off guard because earlier rulings by other courts had gone against Microsoft.An earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, the day of the court\u2019s ruling.

They were far more interested in whether Yahoo\u2019s web, email, news and other businesses will finally be sold \u2014 and at what price.Ms. Mayer had little to say about the potential sale in a webcast with investors to discuss the results. She noted that the company had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d on the strategic review process but offered no timeline for a decision.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s flailing business will make it difficult to get top dollar for the company. According to the research firm eMarketer, Yahoo will get about 1.5 percent of the world\u2019s digital ad revenue this year, down from 2.1 percent last year. By comparison, Google is expected to command 30.9 percent of the market and Facebook is expected to garner 12 percent.Analysts expect the final bids to come in at $3.5 billion to $6 billion, including Yahoo\u2019s land and patents.The write-off of most of the value of the Tumblr blogging network is emblematic of the failure of Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategy to expand Yahoo by luring the mobile young users who drive the business of its chief rivals, Google and Facebook.Yahoo said it was writing off an additional $482 million of Tumblr\u2019s purchase price on top of the $230 million write-off it took in the first quarter.In the second quarter, Yahoo\u2019s revenue was $1.31 billion, up from $1.24 billion in the same quarter a year ago. But the most recent quarter\u2019s revenue rose only because of a change in how Yahoo accounts for revenue from its search partnership with Microsoft. Excluding those changes, revenue fell 15 percent, and both search ads and display ads posted significant drops.The company reported a net loss of $440 million, or 46 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss $22 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the Tumblr write-off and other adjustments, the company\u2019s operating profit fell 64 percent.Shares of Yahoo were down slightly in after-hours trading Monday evening.Ms. Mayer noted that one bright spot for the industry, video advertising, was beginning to see price drops in the face of a glut of inventory as Facebook, Twitter and others churn out more live video and clips. \u201cThere\u2019s so much video, particularly mobile video, coming online that there is some price compression,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Trains were rerouted, forcing riders to disembark and walk several blocks or ride a shuttle bus to get back on a train.So Mr. Alyajouri turned to his cellphone to find a better solution.As cities grow and concerns about pollution and congestion rise, commuters in urban areas are increasingly turning to apps to compare and combine public and private transportation alternatives. \u201cThe shared modes complement public transit, enhancing urban mobility,\u201d said Darnell Grisby, director of policy development and research at the American Public Transportation Association, a trade group based in Washington.Mr. Alyajouri downloaded RideTap, located and booked a Car2Go while still on the train, disembarked and walked to his reserved car to drive downtown.Nationwide, mass transit use stalled during the last decade. According to the Census Bureau, 76.5 percent of commuters drove alone, 9.2 percent car-pooled and 5.2 percent used mass transit in 2014, the latest year for which figures were available. In 2005, 77 percent drove alone, 10.7 percent car-pooled and 4.7 percent used public transportation.Apps hold the promise of altering those percentages by showing passengers how to travel from home to a transit stop and then to their ultimate destination, the so-called first mile-last mile of a commute. Since January, app-based pilot projects have been introduced in Los Angeles, Denver, Portland, Memphis, the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina, and Kansas City, Mo.Cities \u201care in competition with each other for very scarce dollars,\u201d said Ray LaHood, a former secretary of transportation. In May, the Federal Transit Administration announced $8 million in funding to support research and technology so cities could experiment with new operational models.

Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.\u201cIt\u2019s on-demand microtransit,\u201d said Robbie Makinen, president and chief executive of the authority.The $1.50 fare is the same as city bus passengers pay. Mr. Makinen said he anticipated a total ridership of 200 passengers a day after the first six months.Tina Rainey traded a two-bus commute for a single van ride of five minutes to her job as a transporter at the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. At the end of her 4 p.m. shift, oftentimes, \u201cI\u2019m the only one in the van,\u201d she said.Co-workers told her they couldn\u2019t use the service because it stopped running a half-hour before their shifts ended at 7 p.m. The transit authority said it was aware of unmet needs, and Mr. Makinen said he was optimistic about securing funding.Some say the efforts by Ford, which supplies vans in Kansas City, and Daimler, which owns Moovel and Car2Go, in Portland signal a new model for getting access to cars for shorter and more efficient commutes.\u201cMany automobile companies are now investing in shared mobility or transportation as a service either through direct provision of these services, acquisitions, investments and public-private partnerships, or all of the above,\u201d Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email. \u201cThey are also investing in connected and automated vehicle technology, which is now converging with transportation as a service.\u201dExperts expect these experiments to continue.\u201cThere\u2019s an insatiable demand,\u201d said Robert J.

{"Headline": "Slowdown in Merger Deals Attributed to Political Uncertainty", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byUncertainty is often a deal breaker.It can be largely blamed for a string of declines in acquisitions announced during the first half of the year in almost every sector, location and size compared with the same period in 2015. Many executives were hesitant to pull the trigger.About $1.6 trillion worth of deals were announced this year through Thursday, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That represented a 19 percent slump from the first half of the year in 2015 and a slight increase from the same period in 2014. The number of deals \u2014 21,086 \u2014 represented an almost 5 percent decline, indicating that the transactions are smaller.Then, of course, there is the multitude of unknowns surrounding Britain\u2019s unexpected vote to leave the European Union.\u201cBrexit is just the cherry on top,\u201d Kai Liekefett, a partner in the mergers and acquisitions group at Vinson & Elkins, said in a phone interview. \u201cA very bitter cherry.\u201dBritain\u2019s referendum caught many mergers and acquisitions professionals by surprise. A survey by Intralinks published on June 17 showed that 80 percent of deal makers did not believe Britain would leave the E.U. About two-thirds of those surveyed believed that Britain\u2019s departure would have a negative impact on merger activity throughout Europe.Since the vote on June 23, deal makers have been scrambling to determine what it means for clients. So far only a few deals, such as Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s acquisition of the London Stock Exchange, appear to be on thin ice after the vote.Some bankers in the United States have decided to work through the Fourth of July holiday weekend to figure it out.Others have extrapolated what Brexit might indicate about the election in the United States in November. Historically, elections have influenced executives\u2019 willingness to do larger deals because of the turnover expected among regulators who oversee corporate matters and those who handle antitrust concerns.\u201cThe Brexit vote has brought the notion of what is this global populist moment going to do to the global economy,\u201d said Paul Stefanick, head of Americas corporate and investment banking at Deutsche Bank. \u201cPeople are getting more risk-averse until they see the outcome of the election.\u201dThat is not to say deal making will be completely dormant. On Thursday, Lionsgate, the movie studio behind \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d agreed to buy Starz, the premium cable channel, for about $4.4 billion. Just a few weeks ago, Microsoft agreed to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. About six weeks earlier, Abbott signed a deal with St. Jude Medical for $25 billion to enhance its offerings for medical devices. Bankers and lawyers say other deals are in the works, but many do not expect them to reach the level of the activity seen in 2015.To be fair, 2015 was a record year in terms of global deal volume, with about $4.7 trillion worth of deals signed. Some of those have since fallen apart.After the Treasury Department introduced new tax rules, Pfizer abandoned its $152 billion merger with Allergan. Buyers\u2019 remorse led to the termination of Energy Transfer Equity and Williams Companies\u2019 $38 billion combination, after a judge ruled that Energy Transfer could get out. Antitrust concerns caused the breakup of Baker Hughes\u2019 $35 billion proposed combination with fellow oil-field services company Halliburton. Those concerns also thwarted the $6.3 billion Staples-Office Depot deal.Ron Sargent, the chief executive of Staples, said in May that he was stepping down, a signal to other executives that undergoing tricky deals could cost them their jobs.\u201cConfidence is shattered in the executive level,\u201d said Mario Ponce, co-head of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett\u2019s mergers and acquisitions practice. \u201cPeople are pausing and being very thoughtful and hunkering down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Case Shows the Limits of a Data Privacy Law", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchThe battle over the privacy of electronic communications sought in government investigations shifted against the Justice Department last week.The question is whether a judicial decision preventing investigators from obtaining emails stored abroad will finally push Congress to address just how much protection should be afforded to digital information.The case turned on how broadly a court can apply the Stored Communications Act, a law adopted in 1986 as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to give a measure of protection to the then-nascent technology of email. Like almost any 30-year-old law dealing with technology, it is hopelessly out of date because it has not been meaningfully updated by Congress to address how digital information is created and stored.The Second Circuit read the scope of the Stored Communications Act along the same lines, limiting the application of any warrant to what is within this country\u2019s borders because there was no indication in the statute that Congress wanted the law to permit searches outside the United States.As a result, the warrants authorized by the statute are much like ordinary search warrants that can be executed only in the United States because American courts do not have the authority to authorize a search abroad.Of course, digital information does not exist in the same sense that a piece of paper can be found in a specific location. With a few keystrokes, electronic files can be whisked across the globe, and it would have been easy for Microsoft simply to move the information in the customer\u2019s email account to the United States. While the files were in Ireland, that was more a product of how the company chose to store them rather than a conscious decision by the account owner to try to keep them outside the United States.The whole idea behind cloud storage is that electronic information would be available anywhere, so focusing on a particular server may not reflect how the data is stored and retrieved. The very notion that electronic communications are in one particular country may be unrealistic about what actually takes place with data. Email files can be scattered throughout the world and broken into different parts, and may be shifted almost continuously through a company\u2019s system. This is far from the storage of files in the equivalent of locked cabinets that much of the law seems to envision.The incentives created by the Second Circuit\u2019s decision are likely to prove highly problematic for investigators dealing with foreign suspects. It could even affect cases involving domestic conduct if communication providers were to read the opinion as authorizing them to shift data overseas to avoid having to produce customer information in an investigation.Take it a step further by imagining the possibility that a company might offer an email service \u2014 perhaps called \u201cCrim Mail\u201d \u2014 guaranteeing users that their electronic files would be stored overseas. It could even choose to put servers in a location that is notably hostile to the United States and that would welcome the chance to throw a wrench in law enforcement efforts. The company could charge a premium to have files maintained only in specified locations, making it almost impossible for investigators to ever gain access to them.Judge Lynch ended his opinion with a call for Congress to revise the Stored Communications Act. \u201cI believe even more strongly that the statute should be revised, with a view to maintaining and strengthening the act\u2019s privacy protections, rationalizing and modernizing the provisions permitting law enforcement access to stored electronic communications and other data where compelling interests warrant it, and clarifying the international reach of those provisions,\u201d he wrote.There was a push this year to mandate that the government always use a warrant to obtain electronic communications, but opposition from the Securities and Exchange Commission helped scuttle the legislation in the Senate. As a civil regulatory agency, the S.E.C. does not have the authority to obtain a warrant, so it claimed it would be hamstrung in trying to obtain email evidence in its securities fraud investigations.The limits of the Stored Communications Act are now on full display, and it will be up to Congress to solve the puzzle of how much protection should be afforded to personal communications while allowing investigators to gather evidence.

Yet there can be some benefits to upgrading now.If you are hopping on the early-upgrade train for iOS, here are some tips for making the experience smoother and for avoiding disaster.After enrolling, you will receive an email with steps on installing the upgrade.Before installing the upgrade, it is crucial to back up your device data in case something goes wrong. Apple recommends backing up your iPhone or iPad over a wired connection to a computer running the latest version of its iTunes software. After opening iTunes, select your Apple device and hit the Back Up Now button to create a backup on the computer.For now, a new Messages app, which lets you send drawings and animations to other iOS 10 users, will be the biggest change. Apple also made its Photos app smarter \u2014 a feature called Memories will automatically compile multiple photos from an occasion, like your trip to Spain, into video montages. You can also test Apple\u2019s redesigned apps for music, maps and news.A bonus for iPhone 6S or 6S Plus owners is they can use 3D Touch, the feature that triggers different actions based on how hard you press the touch screen, to try some new tricks in iOS 10.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Earnings Are Up, Cushioned by Its Cloud Business", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft is best known for software products like Windows and Office. If you bought a PC, more often than not it came with Windows, and chances are you bought a copy of Office to go with it.But the personal computers that Microsoft makes a lot of software for aren\u2019t selling the way they once did. And the company\u2019s entry into the smartphone business \u2014 which has been eating into PC sales for several years \u2014 was a disaster.It\u2019s a good thing Microsoft is determined not to miss the boat on cloud computing, a current trend that connects people over the internet to software hosted in big data centers.On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter.Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers.\u201cI think they\u2019ve done extraordinarily well,\u201d said Merv Adrian, an analyst at the technology research firm Gartner. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody else who is arguably the challenger to Amazon that Microsoft is.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer.There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable \u2014 a trade-off for slimmer margins.After Microsoft\u2019s misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business.Microsoft bought Nokia\u2019s mobile handset business in 2014 for $9.4 billion, with the goal of making Windows relevant in smartphones, a market dominated by Google\u2019s Android software and Apple\u2019s iPhones.Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago.For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier.Still, Microsoft sometimes manages to outperform the PC market, as it did this quarter, often through sales of the operating systems for higher-end machines.The company\u2019s Windows revenue from PCs sold for the professional market rose 2 percent in the quarter. Windows revenue from the nonprofessional market rose 27 percent, though that was in comparison with an unusually weak quarter last year.For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.The company\u2019s shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.The loss a year ago included $8.4 billion in charges related to a write-down in the value of the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia, along with expenses from layoffs in that group. The pain continued in its most recent quarter with further write-downs and restructuring charges related to its phone business totaling $1.1 billion.Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.Without the deferral, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion, better than the $22.14 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. And excluding the deferral and phone business charges, it earned 69 cents a share, better than the 58 cents a share average estimate of analysts.About 6 cents a share of the upside in its earnings was the result of a lower-than-expected tax rate, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a phone interview.\u201cThis is a nice strong quarter,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s still a company in a pivot with some declining legacy businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Snowden to Help Develop a Safer Phone for Journalists", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 The former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden said Thursday that he planned to help develop a modified version of Apple\u2019s iPhone for journalists who are concerned that they may be the target of government surveillance.The announcement was made during a one-day conference on \u201cForbidden Research\u201d held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Media Lab.Mr. Snowden, who spoke via a video connection from Russia, where he is living in exile, said he was working with Andrew Huang, a computer hacker known as Bunnie who studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., to see if it would be possible to modify a smartphone to alert journalists working in dangerous environments to electronic surveillance.As an example of the dangers of location data, he cited the mortar attack in 2012 by the Syrian government that killed Marie Colvin, an American journalist who was reporting in Homs, Syria, for The Sunday Times of London.\u201cThe radio frequency emissions of her communications that she used to file those news reports were intercepted by the Syrian Army,\u201d he said.He said it was increasingly difficult for users to trust their smartphones. They may be tampered with by malware programs, causing them to transmit location information even when the user may believe that the device has been placed into a safe \u201cairplane mode.\u201dMr. Huang said the project was still experimental, but he hoped it would provide journalists with modified phones that would come in a special case with a separate display that would provide an alert when the phone was active and transmitting data at improper times.The conference focused on issues raised by computer hacking, as well as controversial scientific research in areas such as genetic engineering and geoengineering.\u201cIt will go to a person or group engaged in what we believe is excellent disobedience for the benefit of society. The disobedience that we would like to call out is the kind that seeks to change society in a positive way, and is consistent with a set of key principles,\u201d wrote Joichi Ito, director of the M.I.T.

{"Headline": "High-Tech Wagering Sees Gateway Into America: The Horse Track", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 Ever since the first bookie stood on a step ladder and scrawled odds on a chalkboard, betting on horse racing was just about picking winners.No more.Here, where betting on a horse race (or anything at all) is a cherished pastime, you can wager on a horse to lose.You can bet in the middle of a race \u2014 much the way Wall Street traders buy and sell stock based on market fluctuations \u2014 and even cash out a winning ticket before the race is over, if the price is right.This new style of betting, called exchange wagering, was pioneered by Paddy Power Betfair, helping it become the world\u2019s largest publicly traded online gambling company.Exchange wagering has been available since May in New Jersey, where Betfair will sponsor the Haskell Stakes on Sunday at Monmouth Park in Oceanport. It is part of a broader strategy to woo young gamblers comfortable with fast-paced, tech-focused betting and get ahead in what is expected to be the widespread legalization of sports gambling in the United States.Betfair is not the only European bookmaker to target the United States, where momentum for legalizing sports betting is at a high. The bookmaker William Hill, based in London, has become a dominant operator of sports books in Nevada, where betting on games is already legal.But Paddy Power, through its subsidiary Betfair US, has chosen horse racing as its American beachhead and exchange wagering as its lure to draw new customers. Think eBay for gamblers, with wagers being made in real time by traders allowed to post odds and prices for peers to accept or reject.In betting parlance, the over/under is five years on when legalized sports gambling will be available outside Nevada.\u201cThere is no question in my mind we\u2019re going to have this happen,\u201d Tim Wilmott, the chief executive of Penn National Gaming, a company with 27 casinos and racetracks in 17 states, said recently at the East Coast Gaming Congress in Atlantic City.The European incursion has met resistance from American racetrack operators, many of whom are also gambling companies. Two of the biggest, Churchill Downs Inc. and the Stronach Group, fear exchange wagering will cut into their profits. While Churchill operates the Kentucky Derby and the Stronach Group the Preakness Stakes, both have prohibited Betfair\u2019s exchange wagering, citing concerns it will encourage race fixing.\u201cThere are integrity issues,\u201d said Mike Rogers, the president of the racetrack division of the Stronach Group, which owns prestigious tracks in California and Florida. \u201cExchange waging allows a customer to bet a horse to lose, and we are still concerned about the current economics that is being returned to the industry.\u201dBut Betfair is pushing ahead, with its sights on what could be lucrative terrain if sports betting is legalized beyond Nevada.Legislators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and California have already pushed legislation to legalize sports betting in order to increase state revenue. A formal lobbying effort on Capitol Hill for the expansion of legalized wagering by casinos and gambling interests may begin as early as 2017.American professional sports leagues, once among the fiercest opponents, are getting ready for an era in which betting is legal. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said that betting on his league\u2019s games should be legal and regulated.The N.H.L. recently awarded its 31st franchise to Las Vegas, Sin City itself.Some see the rush to embrace gambling as just that, a rush without careful scrutiny.\u201cWe are pretty concerned about the ability of states to adequately address the impacts of legalized and expanded sports betting on problem gamblers and other vulnerable groups,\u201d said Keith S. Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, which as a group remains neutral on legalized gambling. \u201cThey have done a pretty terrible job with most other forms of legalized gambling.\u201dStill, there are signs the public wants to bet on sports. Nearly two-thirds of the population \u2014 63 percent, according to a recent poll by Seton Hall University \u2014 believes that betting on sports should be legal, and 68 percent of the respondents said sports betting\u2019s legality should be decided at the state level.Last year, Nevada sports books took in a record $4.2 billion in legal wagers, a number that is dwarfed by the billions bet illegally through offshore internet sites or operations run by organized crime. Nearly $150 billion is bet illegally by people in the United States, according to estimates by law enforcement and industry groups, a number that easily doubles when illegal wagering globally is factored in.Under a ratio used in Nevada, the American Gaming Association concluded American casinos could increase annual revenue by at least $8 billion if sports betting was extended beyond Nevada.With advanced technologies \u2014 mobile as well as online \u2014 already in place and a record of taking bets at a large scale, William Hill and Betfair have a huge head start on their American competitors.In Betfair\u2019s case, it is almost a turnkey operation. It already owns two television channels that broadcast more than 40,000 races a year and is available in more than 40 million homes in the United States.It also operates an online betting site, TVG, that handles $1 billion annually on horse racing bets in the United States.\u201cThey already got very robust services in place,\u201d said Sebastian Sinclair, president of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a research and consulting firm that specializes in gambling and entertainment. \u201cThey also have gone through the regulatory process in England and Ireland and have passed rigorous examinations. It gives them a leg up.\u201dKip Levin, president of Betfair US, acknowledged that his company is poised to reap a windfall if sports gambling is legalized in the United States. But he added that over the past eight years Betfair has devoted its efforts, as well as tens of millions of dollars, to become the dominant player in an underrated market in the United States: horse racing.Last year, for example, $3.59 billion was bet online legally in the United States on horse racing, generating roughly $700 million in revenue, according to publicly published data from state racing commissions.That total is four times the $158 million in revenue generated by online casinos, and more than double the $300 million in revenue generated by daily fantasy sports, according to numbers compiled by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a financial research firm.\u201cOur focus is, and has been, on growing horse racing through the television stations, our account wagering and now the exchange,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf sports betting becomes legal in the United States, we are ready and in the position to capitalize on it.\u201dBetfair\u2019s pursuit of gamblers in the United States began here from an office in Silicon Docks, where blue chip tech companies like Google, Facebook, Airbnb, LinkedIn and Twitter have taken root. Its interiors are familiar to start-ups the world over, rows of tabletop desks and blinking computer screens in open-air bullpen fashion.The difference is that not only are the ubiquitous television screens tuned to a never-ending stream of horse races, soccer games and almost every conceivable sporting event that can be bet on, but working alongside the engineers and programmers are seasoned bookies. Among them is Gethin Evans, 37, who started with an odds board and money box at English betting rings at racetracks like Ascot and Cheltenham.To Evans, \u201csmart is the new lucky\u201d is more than just the tag line for Betfair\u2019s American advertising campaign. It is the sum of the lessons that he learned assessing risk, crunching data and bringing it to bear for some of Europe\u2019s leading betting operators.He has been paired with Bart Barden, a product manager who previously worked for divisions of Electronic Arts and Microsoft, to spread the gospel of exchange wagering in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have a cutting edge technology,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou got to anticipate how and why your customers want to use it and then give them all the tools they need to feel comfortable. Gambling is about finding an edge or insight and being able capitalize on it.\u201dIn Betfair\u2019s case, the technology is its exchange wagering platform that allows bettors to set and lock in their wagers at their own odds while also offering bettors midrace options.So far 21 tracks in the United States have allowed their races to be part of the Betfair exchange. Among those races will be those run at the Breeders\u2019 Cup World Championships, which include one of America\u2019s most prestigious and lucrative days of racing. Unlike fixed odds books, which are at the mercy of the outcome of the bets, the exchange takes a fee for processing a transaction.In Ireland, for example, Nyquist, the Kentucky Derby champion, is the 6-5 favorite to win the Haskell at fixed-odds sports books. You either take him or leave him at those odds.In the United States, where parimutuel wagering reigns, bettors are pitted against one another. If Nyquist opens at 6-5 and you bet on him, but so does everyone else, the odds might drop to 2-5 and that is what you are stuck with. If Nyquist wins, instead of getting the $4.40 you counted on, the return is only $2.80 for a $2 bet.On the Betfair exchange, however, a wager can be created by a bettor. For instance, the bettor can bet Nyquist will lose, and seek odds of 4-1. So, if any horse in the field upsets the Kentucky Derby champ, the bettor receives $10. The bettor can also hedge that wager by betting on Nyquist to win if, as the race is being run, it is clear that the colt will not be caught.The exchange platform also offers an automated feature called Cash Out that lets a bettor ensure a profit or mitigate a loss with one click of a smartphone or laptop at any time before the race is over. The feature instantly analyzes the bettor\u2019s market position against all other trades being offered by other bettors.So, if a New Jersey gambler takes Nyqvist to win at 7-5 in and the colt is loose on the lead after six furlongs, the Cash Out feature lets the bettor take a smaller profit before Nyqvist hits the wire, whether the colt ultimately prevails or gets caught in the final jump by a closer.The company has countered concerns that the exchange provides a ripe environment for fixing horse races or sporting matches by entering agreements with various leagues and sports organizations around the world to share information on any unusual betting patterns.In Europe, the exchange\u2019s impact has been dizzying as well as lucrative. Last year, Betfair had 1.7 million customers who made about 1.2 billion bets, an average of 3,287,671 bets a day. But the statistic that gets hearts pounding in American horse racing is the average age of customers on the European exchange: 38 compared with 52, the average age of TVG account holders in the United States. Those bettors, however, are wagering on a variety of sports.\u201cIt goes to the heart of what horse racing wants here: new and younger fans,\u201d said Joe Harper, president and chief executive of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.Exchange wagering has been approved in California, but opposition from the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, as well as some prominent owners, has stalled its implementation.\u201cSomething new is not always met with open arms in the horse racing industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why it is so important that exchange wagering becomes a good experience in New Jersey. It can melt away opposition.\u201d\u201cExchanges bring in new demographics precisely because they offer a low vigorish to the most price sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSabotaging this edge sabotages the exchange\u2019s No. 1 selling point.\u201dThe early returns in New Jersey are encouraging, but company officials concede that American bettors face a steep learning curve. In the first seven weeks of operation in New Jersey, exchange wagering on thoroughbreds was $1,142,228, according to the New Jersey Racing Commission.In a typical seven-week period New Jersey handles about twice that number, $2.4 million, online and by phone.\u201cWe seem to be successful so far in attracting people from beyond the traditional tote pools, and liquidity,\u201d said Bart Barden, director of US Exchange, which is part of Betfair US. \u201cBoth of those bode well as we ramp up our marketing efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Downside to Cord-Cutting", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byTech FixThis year, Michael Gartenberg, a former technology analyst, took the brave step of canceling his cable subscription. After six months of tinkering with alternatives, he went running back.Mr. Gartenberg eventually wondered whether Vue was worth the money he was saving. \u201cAt that point, there had to be better alternatives than this, and it turned out there was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was cable.\u201dYet the overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 about 100 million homes \u2014 still cling to cable.After testing the two for a week, I had an answer: Neither streaming service felt like an adequate substitute for a cable package, largely because of content restrictions, broadcast delays and the difficulty of using a game controller with one of the services.What do Sony\u2019s Vue and Sling TV actually offer? Vue\u2019s starter bundle has more than 55 channels, including ESPN, NBC and Disney, for $30 a month. The higher-tier bundles have 70 channels a month for $35 a month and 100 channels for $45 a month.Sling TV\u2019s base bundle of about 25 channels, which includes ESPN, AMC and CNN, starts at $20 a month. From there, you can add mini bundles, like an extra $5 a month for a group of sports channels, or an additional $5 a month for a children\u2019s bundle including Disney Junior and Nick Toons.Users should be aware that Vue was designed primarily for Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4, which costs about $350. That means the default setup is to use a game controller with the service, though Sony also offers a universal PlayStation 4 remote control that works with Vue for about $30.Sony also offers Vue apps for iPhones, iPads and Android devices, as well as the Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire streaming gadgets.Sling TV works on more devices, including iPhones, iPads and Android devices, plus Apple TV, the Amazon Fire, Roku, Chromecast and the Microsoft Xbox, among others.Another difference is that Vue includes DVR, or the ability to record programs to watch later. You can tag your favorite shows and watch episodes for up to 28 days. Sling TV lacks this ability.For longtime cable subscribers, the limitations on content on Vue and Sling TV may be the toughest to digest. The snags include delays in live broadcasts, the inability to fast-forward through some content, and some missing important channels.With Sling TV, there were long delays when watching live sports. When streaming the Wimbledon tournament, for example, tennis matches were at least 30 seconds behind the live broadcast of the same match on a cable box. This defeats the purpose of watching live sports \u2014 the scores I saw on the screen were behind the scores shown on cable TV or those popping up on Twitter.Sling TV said a number of factors caused broadcast delays, including the internet connection, type of content and channel. By contrast, there was no noticeable delay when watching live sports on Vue.Both services also offer some programs for on-demand viewing, or the ability to watch them whenever you want \u2014 yet for many shows on both services, the services were forbidden to fast-forward through on-demand content. Sony and Sling said the inability to skip through some recorded content was because of agreements with content partners \u2014 in other words, they want you to watch the commercials. The old-school setup of a cable box with TiVo is still more convenient.There are other restrictions, like some major channels missing from both bundles. Sling TV lacks CBS, CW and Discovery, among others. PlayStation Vue also lacks major channels including CW, BBC America and A&E.Another limitation on Vue is that your PlayStation needs to stay put \u2014 meaning if you activated Vue in your house and then took the PlayStation to your family member\u2019s house, you could not log in to Vue. Sony said that network providers designed this restriction to limit TV viewing to your home.Watching TV on a big screen is a group experience, so it\u2019s important to be able to hand the remote control to others to let them channel surf. So I invited my neighbors over and asked them to do something simple with Vue and Sling TV: Find something they wanted to watch. They accomplished the tasks fairly quickly on both services, though they struggled with the PlayStation game controller.One neighbor, who works for a utility company, took about three minutes to figure out how to use the PlayStation controller to load the TV guide and pick something to watch. His wife, a scientist, took about a minute. A third neighbor, a museum worker, fumbled with the controller for about four minutes before finding an episode of \u201cScandal.\u201d They all found the universal remote control, which Sony sells separately, much more intuitive.By contrast, the test subjects all immediately knew how to use Sling TV to pick TV shows or sports events they wanted to watch, using a Roku TV remote, largely because its interface was more streamlined than the Vue\u2019s.It\u2019s tough to recommend either Vue or Sling TV as replacements for a majority of cable subscribers. Technologically, both Vue and Sling TV have better-designed software than a traditional cable box from Comcast, Time Warner or Charter. But because there are some missing major channels and annoying restrictions on how content can be watched, most consumers are better off sticking with cable.Sports fans may enjoy getting access to ESPN and other sports channels on either Vue or Sling TV for less than the cost of a traditional cable subscription. But the broadcast delay on Sling TV is a deal breaker. And if you don\u2019t regularly play video games, buying a PlayStation 4 just for watching sports is costly and impractical. (The Vue apps made for cheaper streaming devices, like Roku and Fire TV, aren\u2019t as powerful as the PlayStation app.)Roger Lynch, the chief executive of Sling TV, said the service gave people the flexibility to subscribe to bundles based on their preferences. \u201cEveryone has their own reasons for becoming a Sling subscriber,\u201d he said in an interview.Eric Lempel, a marketing executive for Sony, said, \u201cWe wanted to give you all the channels that you want,\u201d without the need to pay for hundreds of unnecessary channels.For a small set of cable subscribers, both Vue and Sling TV will have all the channels they want, but they will also include unwanted channels, too.In a perfect world, consumers could pick each channel they want and pay for it, \u00e0 la carte. But the content providers still hold the cards, and there is no easy way to do that quite yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter, Grappling with Anemic Growth, Tries to Bolster Its Advertising Business", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a description that is also applicable to Twitter.Not so for Twitter. For months, the San Francisco-based company has been grappling with worsening advertising growth and anemic audience growth. It risks losing out on top talent and deals to other bigger, stronger companies.Twitter posted revenue of $602 million for the quarter, up 20 percent from a year ago and below Wall Street estimates of $607 million. Its net loss narrowed to $107 million, or 15 cents a share. Twitter\u2019s users grew 3 percent from a year ago, to 313 million.Looking ahead, the company projected revenue of $590 million to $610 million for the current quarter, far below analyst estimates of $681 million.Still, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, struck an upbeat note.\u201cAs C.E.O., I\u2019ve seen a lot of the benefit of our focus and execution over the past year,\u201d he said in a conference call with investors on Tuesday.At the heart of the problem is that the 10-year-old company is still struggling with how to make its product appealing to an audience on a larger scale. Part of the challenge has been direct comparisons to Facebook, which lures more than 1.65 billion monthly visitors to its site.For a time, Twitter was able to sidestep concerns about its ability to add new users because of the strength of its advertising business; revenue was growing in the high double-digit figures.That has changed. Over the last six months, Twitter has experienced slower growth in advertiser demand, spooking investors and causing its stock to plummet.Twitter\u2019s inability to attract new users caught up to it, analysts said, causing a stagnation in advertiser demand. As Twitter is less able to increase the size of its user base, advertisers are more likely to buy ads on Facebook, which has a huge global reach, or perhaps Snapchat, which caters largely to younger audiences.\u201cIt all goes back to the company focusing on building a ubiquitous product and failing to deliver on that promise,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.To turn itself around, Twitter has bet on live streaming video. The company has struck agreements with the National Football League, Bloomberg and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, among others, to live stream events. Twitter will also try to sell more costly ads \u2014 namely video ads, which carry a much higher premium \u2014 to its existing advertiser base.\u201cWe\u2019ve become a video-centric platform,\u201d Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in the company\u2019s conference call on Tuesday. \u201cIt is now the No. 1 ad format in terms of revenue on Twitter.\u201dThe company is also working on bolstering what is called direct response advertising, which prompts users to take an action like downloading a mobile app or signing up for a newsletter. The effectiveness of those ads, Twitter said, is easier to measure, which could provide repeat business. While such ads are currently a small portion of the company\u2019s overall advertising revenue, Twitter hopes to increase it over time, said Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer.\u201cWe\u2019re focused now on what matters most, and what we need to fix,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kevin Turner, Microsoft Executive, to Join Citadel Securities", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 A top Microsoft executive, Kevin Turner, is leaving the company to join Citadel Securities as its new chief executive, continuing a wave of executive departures of technology industry leaders to financial firms.Mr. Turner, Microsoft\u2019s chief operating officer, oversaw Microsoft\u2019s large sales organization, but Microsoft said he would not be replaced. His duties will instead be distributed among several other company executives.Mr. Turner was widely known to have ambitions of being a chief executive himself, so his departure was little surprise. When Microsoft\u2019s previous chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, announced his retirement, Mr. Turner was among several internal candidates at the company vying to replace him.The job eventually went to another internal candidate, Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in early 2014.\u201cHe was not chosen as Ballmer\u2019s successor, and it\u2019s interesting that it has been this long that he chose to leave,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.\u201cHe built the sales force into the strategic asset it is today with incredible talent, while at the same time more than doubling our revenue and driving customer satisfaction scores to the highest in company history,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a statement.In the two biggest executive promotions that will result from Mr. Turner\u2019s departure, Mr. Nadella said Judson Althoff will lead the company\u2019s worldwide commercial business and Jean-Philippe Courtois will run global sales, marketing and operations. Both men will report to Mr. Nadella and join the company\u2019s senior leadership team.Mr. Nadella said that Mr. Turner, who was with Microsoft for 11 years after spending nearly two decades as an executive at Walmart, will be at Microsoft through the end of July.And Two Sigma Investments, a quantitative hedge fund based in New York, hired Alfred Spector, a senior executive at Google, to be chief technology officer last year.Citadel Securities is owned by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, who also founded a $25 billion hedge fund called Citadel. Mr. Griffin founded the hedge fund 25 years ago as a young graduate after successfully trading bonds out of his Harvard dorm.In recent years, Mr. Griffin has made a big push into market, making and electronic trading with Citadel Securities, disrupting a business that was once the domain of banks. It operates dark pools \u2014 platforms to match buyers and sellers of securities off public exchanges \u2014 and places trades for both retail and institutional investors, processing more than a billion shares each day. It also claims to have 35 percent share of daily retail stock trading in the United States.Citadel appears in Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys,\u201d which tells the story of technology firms that have contributed to the breakup of central stock exchanges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smart Doesn\u2019t Always Mean an Easy Home", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s a reason they call them Smart Homes, not Easy Homes.But setting up the system turned out to be a \u201cherculean task,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. Eventually, he got the lights to work remotely, but the door lock never did, so he quit trying.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately what I am looking for: Fire it up, take some time setting it up, then it just works.\u201dThese days, even a technophobe can set up a remote-control light switch or thermostat and operate it by phone. Improvements in technology, including voice recognition, artificial intelligence and more affordable sensors, have made home automation easier to use. Cheaper, too.The smart home still isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 or easy, exactly. But if you haven\u2019t used any of this technology yet, it might be time to start thinking about it. Here\u2019s what you need to know first.Smart home technology is a catchall term that includes household appliances and devices that connect to the internet, so you can see and control them remotely using a phone, tablet or computer. That can mean being able to turn on a single lamp, or controlling and monitoring almost everything in a house, including heating and cooling, security cameras, lawn sprinklers, televisions, stereos, robotic vacuums, a doorbell, door locks, lights, air quality, fire alarms, baby monitors and more. It means you\u2019ll always have the answer to the question, \u201cDid I leave the stove on?\u201dIf you stick to a single system \u2014 say, all lights or electrical outlets from the same manufacturer \u2014 setup is pretty easy. But chances are, you\u2019ll want to use products from more than one company, and that\u2019s where the difficulty comes in: Different brands use different technology, and they don\u2019t always talk to each other.The chief appeal of Apple\u2019s HomeKit is that it\u2019s comparatively easy to set up and use. Devices are paired with your phone or tablet, in much the same way you\u2019d connect a Bluetooth headset or speaker, only with more steps. And the company\u2019s next software update, due this fall, will group all the controls on one screen, so you can run your whole house from a single app. The downside: HomeKit doesn\u2019t have as many accessories as some other systems do.But tricks like these take some know-how to set up and manage. And neither Apple nor Amazon makes the plugs, switches and sensors that their systems run, which is why these systems can be a technological patchwork. Some of the accessories communicate by Wi-Fi; others use Bluetooth, radio or electrical lines, or a combination.Once you\u2019ve installed and run a simple accessory, like an on/off switch, you should feel comfortable enough to try something a little more complicated.You might start by creating \u201cscenes,\u201d which send instructions to several devices with a single voice command. This can take some time to set up, as you have to tell the central control what you want each of the individual devices to do. But by issuing a simple command like \u201cLet\u2019s watch a movie,\u201d you could have the curtains close, the lights dim and the television and DVD player turn on.\u201cEvery hour on the hour, there is a new scene,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. And he didn\u2019t stop there. He created other scenes for watching television, listening to music, eating dinner \u2014 more than a dozen in all. \u201cAt this point,\u201d he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to a normal bulb.\u201dEven so, that\u2019s not enough, Mr. Dumas said. If you follow a predictable routine, he explained, \u201cAfter a few times, it should ask, \u2018We notice when you get home and it\u2019s dark out, you turn on the hallway light, then turn on ESPN; do you want us to do that?\u2019 \u201dBut that\u2019s easier said than done.\u201cIt\u2019s so simple to comprehend the internet of Things 2.0, and people think we are there, and we aren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Dumas said. \u201cWe are at 1.0, and there is a lot of value there, but 2.0 is where we need to go.\u201dMost of the smart home devices I tried were pretty simple to use. But the more I piled on the network, the glitchier things got. My suggestion: Stick with as few brands as possible or resign yourself to using some apps in lieu of voice control.Apple HomeKitAmazon EchoLutronElgatoPhilips HueAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Trying to Endear Itself to Europe, Spreads $450 Million Around", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byA yearlong digital training course for Irish high school teachers started in 2014. A fund to help European news outlets adapt to the web popped up in 2015. And in March, a virtual reality exhibition began at a Belgian museum to showcase a Renaissance painter.All these projects are aimed at supporting European culture and education, helping the region embrace the fast-changing online world. And all are financed by Google.Google has been staging a full-court press in Europe to finance everything from start-up offices to YouTube-sponsored music concerts, trying to remake its image in the region as it battles a mounting list of regulatory woes.Those efforts represent a campaign of \u201csoft lobbying\u201d where instead of, or alongside, paying registered lobbyists to advocate its case in the corridors of power, a company looks to change the minds of the public at large. In Google\u2019s case, experts say, its push to sponsor digital skills training, museum exhibitions and other programs equates to an almost unprecedented effort by a United States tech company to change the perceptions of Europeans, many of whom still see it as an American interloper that does not play by the rules.Google\u2019s soft lobbying efforts are by no means unique, and have filled a funding gap that governments and European rivals are unwilling, or incapable, of matching.But the company has ramped up its campaign in recent years, earmarking about $450 million from 2015 to 2017 \u2014 based on Google\u2019s public filings and industry estimates of its activities \u2014 to revamp its reputation with Europeans and, more important, the region\u2019s policy makers who have the power to issue fines totaling billions of dollars.Google\u2019s vast array of programs \u201care important for our partners, for us and for the countries where we work,\u201d he added.Even before its recent charm offensive, it was one of the largest spenders on direct lobbying in Brussels, home to most of its European regulatory headaches.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cOf course, Google has its own agenda to show to Europe\u2019s political powers that they aren\u2019t bad guys,\u201d said Michael Peters, chief executive of Euronews. \u201cBut this gives organizations like ours the chance to do these types of projects. It wouldn\u2019t have happened without Google.\u201dThe Silicon Valley company is also tapping into a more friendly audience: Europe\u2019s tech community.In Dublin, home to Google\u2019s European headquarters, that has involved a one-year course in software coding for local teachers. Participants in the class, run by Trinity College Dublin, have been invited to the company\u2019s glass-fronted offices on the shores of the Liffey River to learn directly from Google staff members.\u201cI\u2019m so confident now that I can teach my students anything and they can just run with it,\u201d said Helen O\u2019Kelly, 38, a former Microsoft employee who retrained to become an I.T. teacher.Not all of Google\u2019s good will activities have been so well accepted.Museums still regularly question Google\u2019s motives because the tools like high-definition cameras to digitize artwork are all free. Institutions also have raised concerns about who controls the copyright of the masterpieces (Google says all rights remain with the institutions).The tech giant has often picked museums with a digital connection. That includes the restoration of Bletchley Park, a museum on the outskirts of London that housed British codebreakers during World War II and that helped spur the creation of modern-day computers.\u201cThat\u2019s typical of Americans,\u201d she said when asked about a large poster at the entrance to Bletchley Park highlighting Google\u2019s financial support.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Europeans that Google hopes to train on digital skills. The company expects to train two million, not three million, by the end of the year.Advertisement"}

Venture capitalists have a special term for investment opportunities that offer the potential for a big return but also carry a great deal of risk: high beta. For Silicon Valley\u2019s political aspirations, Mr. Thiel\u2019s speech is the ultimate high-beta performance.On the one hand, an emissary from tech will have a national platform to push the industry\u2019s agenda and, more important, its worldview. By the end of Mr. Thiel\u2019s speech on Thursday night, it\u2019s possible he will have succeeded in showing off an ideology that is rarely encountered in public \u2014 the hands-off-my-stuff, techno-libertarian vision that is a hobbyhorse of Mr. Thiel and a few other Silicon Valley bigwigs.On the other hand, this could end quite badly.Here\u2019s how we analyzed the third night of the Republican National Convention, which featured Mike Pence, Ted Cruz and more.The danger, then, is that not only could Mr. Thiel\u2019s public embrace of Mr. Trump backfire on him, but it could also become another plot point in the larger story line that Silicon Valley is exclusionary and narrow-minded and that its innovations are advancing global inequality.What\u2019s more, the speech could spoil what had been growing areas of overlap between the Republicans and the tech industry. In the Obama years, much of Silicon Valley has become very close to Democrats. This year there was an opportunity for a Republican to make overtures to tech \u2014 but with Mr. Trump, that chance seems to have passed.\u201cWhere Trump has stood on immigration reform, or how he called for a boycott of Apple, or on a number of other issues, it almost seems like he\u2019s gone out of his way to smite Silicon Valley leaders on the issues they care about,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Silicon Valley Republican who has worked for several presidential campaigns, including Mitt Romney\u2019s and John McCain\u2019s. Mr. Harrison said he would vote this year for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential candidate.Mr. Harrison was one of the few Silicon Valley Republicans willing to chat openly about their options this year. Virtually every prominent Republican in the industry whom I called declined to comment or was willing to speak only anonymously about the strained connection between the tech industry and the Republican Party.Mr. Thiel, a billionaire known for his unusual positions, does not appear to be too bothered by kryptonite. And some on the right said they were open to hearing what Mr. Thiel had to say in defense of Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is our democratic process, and I don\u2019t think we should try to shout down Peter Thiel because he\u2019s not saying the same thing that everyone else here is saying,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Initiative, a tech-policy research group. But Mr. Johnson, an African-American Republican who said he was also voting for the Libertarian candidate this year, said he doubted that Mr. Thiel could persuade him to support Mr. Trump.\u201cAs a black guy in Silicon Valley, I just find it very hard to support a candidate who has been called racist,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Make Conventions Great Again", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byPolitical conventions used to mean something important. Specifically, they used to mean: \u201cHere is where we will pick our party\u2019s nominee.\u201dBut today\u2019s political conventions are largely dog and pony shows to make the delegates feel special, give the news media something to talk about, and benefit the host city, all while promoting the party\u2019s agenda.Party conventions \u2014 perhaps not in terms of their importance, but the sheer logistical headaches they impose \u2014 are the political equivalent of the Olympics. And what with delegates, alternates, reporters, party officials and other attendees, Cleveland is expecting roughly 50,000 people to show up for the Republican National Convention next week. (Convention planners had less time than anticipated to get Quicken Loans Arena ready, thanks to the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 run in the N.B.A. finals.)In a normal election year, a party\u2019s convention would attract a high-profile slate of speakers, including up-and-comers. (A young state senator named Barack Obama made his national debut at the 2004 Democratic convention, for example.) But this is not a normal election year, and a stunning number of Republican leaders have decided not to attend the convention.Apart from the question of star power, there is the question of money. Conventions, like the Olympics, can be a branding boost for the host cities, which is why they lobby so hard to win bids.Despite talk that the polarizing campaign would make it difficult to fund-raise for the convention this year, David Gilbert, the president and chief executive of the nonpartisan Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, said his group has raised more than 90 percent of the $64 million it was given the task of getting, \u201cfar more than any other convention in history.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve always said this was not about red or blue; it was about green,\u201d he said.Even companies that decided to stay in the convention tried to distance themselves from the presumptive Republican nominee, according to Rashad Robinson, a spokesman for Color of Change PAC. He recalled talking to an AT&T representative who stressed the company\u2019s support for immigration reform, in contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\u201cIf any one of their employees came to work and said the things that Donald Trump says in front of the media, on the campaign trail, they\u2019d be fired,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last three standard-bearers for the Republican Party aren\u2019t even going to the convention, so why do these companies feel that they need to?\u201d\u201cTo me, they\u2019re supporting democracy and the democratic process,\u201d said Chip DiPaula, a Baltimore businessman who helped organize the Republican conventions in 1996 and 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s an important celebration of American ideals that are over and above any particular nominee.\u201dMr. Robinson disagreed.\u201cThose companies are on the wrong side of history,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t give credit to people who have empathy. History gives credit to people who stand up and make decisions that are sometimes tough.\u201dMr. Gilbert, the Cleveland convention president, said this year presents \u201ccertainly a more politically charged convention cycle than we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d but added that he felt the city is well prepared.\u201cOne of the problems with this is, it\u2019s just like running any big event,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can prepare. You can plan. But until the event is over, it\u2019s not over.\u201dManaging a convention can make even the most absurd logistical problems seem important. Maria Cino, who has been attending Republican conventions since 1984, and was president and chief executive of the 2008 convention in St. Paul, recalled a particular problem in 1996. The Republicans met in San Diego that year, and the convention center\u2019s ceilings were just 25 feet high, making a traditional balloon drop unfeasible. Instead, engineers shot balloons into the air from cannons. Ms. Cino said it was \u201ca bit of a nightmare.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we would do that again,\u201d she said.Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton, said scenes from this year\u2019s Republican convention could mirror the protests and riots seen outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago.

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s $9.3 Billion Deal for NetSuite Will Bolster Its Cloud Offerings", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Evan M. Goldberg founded NetSuite in 1998, he did so with backing from his former boss, Lawrence J. Ellison, who started the software giant Oracle.On Thursday, their relationship came full circle as Oracle agreed to acquire NetSuite for $9.3 billion to beef up its cloud offerings.It made Oracle bigger, but it did not change its business model. About 5,000 PeopleSoft employees, close to half the company, were laid off in the following months.The NetSuite purchase, on the other hand, is at the heart of Oracle\u2019s fight to remake itself for the modern world of cloud computing, or providing accessing to vast computational resources over the internet. This transition has shaken up the software business for the last several years. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created markets worth billions, and older companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have struggled to change the way they make and sell their products.The deal also illustrates that, for all the reach and novelty of tech, Silicon Valley remains a very small place with long personal histories. Mr. Goldberg got the idea for NetSuite after conversations with Mr. Ellison about where else the internet might go. Down the hall was another rising star at Oracle, named Marc Benioff.Mr. Benioff started a company called Salesforce.com within weeks of NetSuite\u2019s start, also with backing from Mr. Ellison. Today, Salesforce is regarded as the leading company selling only cloud software, with a market capitalization of $55.7 billion.NetSuite\u2019s chief executive, Zachary Nelson, is a well-regarded leader who also worked at Oracle and is close to Mr. Ellison. NetSuite has held customer events at Mr. Ellison\u2019s Silicon Valley estate. He is likely to occupy a senior role at Oracle.Mr. Ellison, through personal and family holdings, owns more than 40 percent of NetSuite, which makes the deal to acquire it a phenomenal payday for a man who was already among the world\u2019s richest.NetSuite has more than 5,000 employees and specializes in accounting and other back-office e-commerce software, particularly for smaller businesses. It has also created online software for manufacturing that is akin to some of Oracle\u2019s software applications. But that online software is created, sold and serviced differently.Oracle has, for most of the last decade, bought cloud companies and spent big on remaking its engineering and sales staff for the cloud world. That has paid off some: In the last fiscal year, the company had $12.2 billion in core cloud software sales, an increase of 49 percent from fiscal 2014.That is enough to make Oracle one of the largest cloud companies, but it was still just 8 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Overall revenue shrank 3 percent last year, as demand for older products fell.It might have been worse. Giant tech companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard have endured sharp revenue drops as cloud computing becomes more important, and have struggled to cope in the new environment.Oracle has fared relatively well, in part because its core product, a powerful database used for financial and managerial work, is at the center of most major companies worldwide. Competitors are trying to sell more modern databases to replace Oracle, with relatively little success so far.\u201cOracle and NetSuite cloud applications are complementary, and will coexist in the marketplace forever,\u201d Mark Hurd, chief executive of Oracle, said in the statement.An Oracle special committee made up of independent directors led the process to sign a deal with NetSuite. The transaction is expected to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals and agreement by a majority of NetSuite\u2019s shareholders, not including shares owned by executives of NetSuite or anyone affiliated with Mr. Ellison.Shares of NetSuite surged to a level just below the deal price in early trading on Thursday and closed at $108.41.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Ends an Era for a Web Pioneer", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo was the front door to the web for an early generation of internet users, and its services still attract a billion visitors a month.But the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterday\u2019s great idea, and Yahoo has now reached the end of the line as an independent company.The board of the Silicon Valley company has agreed to sell Yahoo\u2019s core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.That compares with Yahoo\u2019s peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is not expected to join Verizon, but she is due to receive a severance payout worth about $57 million, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.Verizon and Yahoo declined to comment on the deal.Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.For a long time, the model worked. It seemed as if every company in America \u2014 and across much of the world \u2014 wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured into Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival required a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancies, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.Ms. Mayer, who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief executive four years ago but failed to halt its decline, was nevertheless rewarded handsomely for her efforts. Including the severance, she will have received cash and stock compensation worth about $218 million during her time at Yahoo, according to Equilar\u2019s calculations.Created by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo was originally a hand-selected directory to the nascent World Wide Web, but it quickly expanded its ambitions.\u201cYahoo is where you start,\u201d Jeff Mallett, the company\u2019s first chief operating officer, explained during a 1996 interview with a job candidate, Dan Finnigan. Mr. Finnigan, now the chief executive of Jobvite, said that he was skeptical of Yahoo\u2019s quest to dominate every category of content, but he later joined the company to run its HotJobs division.Google, which emerged a few years later, used a superior, more automated approach to indexing the web. Under its first chief executive, Timothy Koogle, Yahoo struck a four-year deal with Google in June 2000 to make Google\u2019s search engine the default on its website. Yahoo\u2019s leaders also tried to buy Google but eventually settled on building their own search tool.While Google was singularly focused on search, Yahoo recast itself as a content company under its second chief executive, Terry Semel, who succeeded Mr. Koogle in 2001.Yahoo then went through two more chief executives and two interim bosses in about three years, before hiring Ms. Mayer, a former Google search executive and tech celebrity, in July 2012.Despite her acclaim, Ms. Mayer failed to resolve Yahoo\u2019s central problem: a lack of focus.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The Alibaba offering put pressure on Ms. Mayer to come up with a plan to distribute that windfall to shareholders and prove that her turnaround plan was working.\u201cShe knew she was holding a melting ice cube in her hand. Rather than focus on slowing down the rate it was melting, she said, \u2018Let\u2019s look three, four, five years out,\u2019\u201d said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Company, who has followed the company for a decade.Mr. Finnigan, the former Yahoo executive, said that in hindsight, the company tried to compete in so many areas that it was difficult to succeed.\u201cYou have to be Coke or Pepsi. You don\u2019t want to be RC Cola. They let a lot of these verticals become RC Cola,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a sad day for those Yahoos who tried as hard as they did to create value.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley of Space Start-Ups? It Could Be Seattle", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside an office in this city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby.There\u2019s more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle\u2019s abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.\u201cThe reason for it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don\u2019t seem to want to move to L.A.\u201d\u201cAbandoned in Place,\u201d a new book of photographs by Roland Miller, finds haunting beauty in derelict launch pads, rusting towers and other detritus of the American space race.One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun\u2019s energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won\u2019t say how much they\u2019ve invested.\u201cMany of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,\u201d said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s director of marketing and business development.Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in which Boeing is based. It is Chicago, not Seattle. (Though the company moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001, about half of its workforce is still in Seattle.)Advertisement"}

We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential.I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not.Notice how today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses.Yahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed.I will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers.Problem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn\u2019t the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully.It\u2019s probably more nuanced than this, but we\u2019re out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog.

Their task is to nominate the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the election in November. There is a single contender: Donald J. Trump, the property tycoon, reality TV star and \u2014 after a successful primary campaign that upended American politics this spring \u2014 the man poised to take the nomination.Is the outcome in doubt?Not really, although there could be complications. In a normal year, conventions are pageants of carefully choreographed political theater in which the party seeks to heal the wounds of the primary election, unite behind a candidate and galvanize its base for the larger battle of the presidential election.However, Facebook and Microsoft will provide services.Who\u2019s backing Mr. Trump?Survivors of the 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, are scheduled to speak, as are several of Mr. Trump\u2019s vanquished rivals from the primary contest, like Senator Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.Although many senior Republicans are skipping the conference, it will be hosted by Paul D.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Is a Case Study in Poor Timing", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsYahoo has fittingly closed a portal on tech mergers and acquisitions.The company\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon caps two decades of deals and non-deals that shaped internet history. Yahoo got lucky with Alibaba, but failed to capitalize on its dominance by not acquiring companies like Google, Facebook and eBay. Spurning Microsoft also was a mistake. It is a one-company textbook on timing.Yahoo, the web creation of Jerry Yang and David Filo, captured the popular embrace of the internet back in 1994, and a large chunk of the internet\u2019s value along with it. Its market capitalization once exceeded $140 billion, and it even occupied the exclusive Boardwalk spot in a dot-com edition of the Monopoly board game. It failed, however, to anticipate how technology would supplant human curation of the web.Its overpriced stock was successfully deployed during the heady days of tech mayhem in the 1990s, but put to poor use. It spent $3.6 billion on the web-hosting service GeoCities and another $5.7 billion on the early internet-radio service Broadcast.com. Both services eventually faded away. Yahoo first ignored Google and then quibbled over a price tag that was lower than Broadcast\u2019s. Mark Zuckerberg likewise rejected a $1 billion offer for his fledgling Facebook.Yahoo kept showcasing its inverse Midas touch. The internet-ad auction firm Overture, the photo-sharing service Flickr and other promising start-ups simply were clouded by Yahoo\u2019s miasma.It is exceptionally tough to arrest a tech business in decline. The Alibaba deal, however, gave Yahoo the financial firepower to subsist for longer than it otherwise might have. In 2005, it contributed its own Chinese business and $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba, an investment now worth some $30 billion. The lack of self-awareness by the founders about Yahoo\u2019s faltering health, however, was its downfall. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo torpedoed the generous $45 billion takeover offer in 2008 from a then-panicky Microsoft.In the end, Yahoo may have managed to gin up a frothier auction than it deserved and thus fetched an outsize price from Verizon. It will be little consolation given what might have been. At least Yahoo has left behind a case study in M.&A. that should be of significant value.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "A Small Corner of Mexico Is Experiencing a Rising Tide of Property Investment", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byPUNTA DE MITA, Mexico \u2014 Interest in this small corner of Mexico by one of the world\u2019s richest men has helped attract an influx of wealthy investors.In 2014, Cascade Investment, the private investment firm of Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, bought 19.5 hectares, or 48 acres, of undeveloped beachfront land and the Four Seasons hotel site in Punta Mita, a gated residential resort on the Riviera Nayarit, 40 minutes north of the town of Puerto Vallarta. The cost was reported to be $200 million.\u201cBill Gates buying land in the area has had a real impact,\u201d said Aaron Fisher, the sales director at Punta Sayulita, another residential development on the Riviera Nayarit. \u201cWe needed high-end clients and now they\u2019re coming.\u201dThe purchase was seen as an endorsement of the region\u2019s potential, and the ripple effect has begun to reach surrounding communities. These include Sayulita, a charming, bustling town with a stretch of beach, ideal surf conditions and warren of small streets.The town has been a draw for watersport enthusiasts and those wanting a more bohemian lifestyle for several decades. But a new wave of cosmopolitan, higher-spending residents has begun to roll in.\u201cBuyers are primarily American, or from Mexico and Canada,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cIn particular the Pacific Northwest. There\u2019s a big tech contingent but also financiers and media people.\u201dProperties in this region of Mexico are usually priced in United States dollars. Building lots around town are available from $80,000. Small one- or two-bedroom homes start at $130,000, and upmarket two-bedroom apartments in purpose-built blocks start at about $250,000. Hillside villas on large plots with the best views are priced from about $800,000.Punta Sayulita is a small-scale, luxury project five minutes by golf cart from the town center and commands some of the highest prices in the area. Villas, which are open-plan and designed in Hawaiian style, range from 279 square meters, or 3,000 square feet, to 743 square meters, and start at $1.45 million.There is access to a residents\u2019 beach club, bar and spa, but Mr. Fisher said that a big appeal to many buyers is the proximity to the town of Sayulita. \u201cResidents can work from here, send their kids to the local international school and walk to town for the restaurants, bars and shopping,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can even paddleboard across the bay.\u201dSuch is the appeal of the area to watersport enthusiasts that Fernando Stalla, a two-time stand-up paddleboard world champion, is on the development\u2019s sales team and is its brand ambassador.Mr. Stalla grew up in Sayulita. \u201cThe town has not changed much in size in the past 20 years, but there has been real improvement in the quality of shops and restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much more money here now.\u201dThough foreigners cannot directly own property within 30 miles of Mexico\u2019s coast, they can buy via a \u201cfideicomiso,\u201d in which a property title is held in trust by a bank. Individuals named as beneficiaries of the trust have full ownership rights.The rise in popularity of the Riviera Nayarit is also driven by the growth of the much larger Pacific coast resort town of Puerto Vallarta as a vacation destination and the expansion of the local airport to allow more international traffic.Chris and Ashely Ostrowski moved from Park City, Utah, to Sayulita with their two children in 2010. \u201cWe were already familiar with the area and wanted to give our children a different view of the world, to be bilingual and meet different people,\u201d said Mr. Ostrowski, who is an avid surfer.\u201cOne reason for choosing Sayulita was that Puerto Vallarta airport is an hour away,\u201d he said. \u201cAshley needed to be able to commute to the States for work, so having an airport close was a requirement.\u201d The Ostrowskis have rented homes while in Sayulita, though they own plots in the town and plan to build their own house. \u201cSayulita is home now,\u201d Mr. Ostrowski said.The area\u2019s high-level watersports are a definite driver of the property market according to Brendan Wood, the sales and marketing director of Punta Mita Properties, which operates within the Punta Mita resort. \u201cTen years ago golf was driving resort development; now it\u2019s oceangoing sports,\u201d he said.Punta Mita was established 15 years ago, when the Mexican developer Dine bought 607 hectares to develop a luxury resort with hotels, beach clubs and restaurants, several hundred residences and two Jack Nicklaus-designed golf courses.Sales at the development slowed during the 2008 downturn, as they did across most of the region, but are now showing signs of renewed health. A number of the resort\u2019s subdivisions have sold out or have only a few remaining properties, and demand has meant that lot sales and construction of new residences for purchase are now underway.The resort has about 350 private homes and capacity for as many as 1,000. Residences range from two-bedroom apartments starting at $345,000 to expansive private villas with pools and waterfront views costing in excess of $10 million.Mr. Wood said values in the resort have risen 5 percent, on average, in the past 18 months, though residences coming under the Four Season brand have risen 12 percent. \u201cPunta Mita commands a 30 to 60 percent higher price point than similar properties in other local areas,\u201d Mr. Wood said. Even so, values have still not reached levels seen in 2007.Buyers mostly come from the United States, Canada and Mexico, but the age is dropping from the over-50s to those in their 30s and 40s. Mr. Wood said they are predominantly members of a \u201ctech elite\u201d who have young families and like to surf, sail and paddleboard. In addition to Mr. Gates, executives from companies like Apple and Yahoo have bought there.What Mr. Gates intends to do with his land in Punta Mita is not yet known.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power of \u2018Why?\u2019 and \u2018What If?\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsRecently I had a conversation with a chief executive who expressed concern about several of her senior managers. They were smart, experienced, competent. So what was the problem? \u201cThey\u2019re not asking enough questions,\u201d she said.This wouldn\u2019t have been a bad thing in the business world of a few years ago, where the rules for success were: Know your job, do your work, and if a problem arises, solve it and don\u2019t bother us with a lot of questions.But increasingly I\u2019m finding that business leaders want the people working around them to be more curious, more cognizant of what they don\u2019t know, and more inquisitive \u2014 about everything, including \u201cWhy am I doing my job the way I do it?\u201d and \u201cHow might our company find new opportunities?\u201dI may be hyper-aware of this trend because I think of myself as a \u201cquestionologist,\u201d having studied the art of questioning and written a book about it. But I also think there are real forces in business today that are causing people to value curiosity and inquiry more than in the past.Companies in many industries today must contend with rapid change and rising uncertainty. In such conditions, even a well-established company cannot rest on its expertise; there is pressure to keep learning what\u2019s new and anticipating what\u2019s next. It\u2019s hard to do any of that without asking questions.Asking questions can help spark the innovative ideas that many companies hunger for these days. In the research for my book, I studied business breakthroughs \u2014 including the invention of the Polaroid instant camera and the Nest thermostat and the genesis of start-ups like Netflix, Square and Airbnb \u2014 and found that in each case, some curious soul looked at a current problem and asked insightful questions about why that problem existed and how it might be tackled.The Polaroid story is my favorite: The inspiration for the instant camera sprang from a question asked in the mid-1940s by the 3-year-old daughter of its inventor, Edwin H. Land. She was impatient to see a photo her father had just snapped, and when he tried to explain that the film had to be processed first, she wondered aloud, \u201cWhy do we have to wait for the picture?\u201dSo how can companies encourage people to ask more questions? There are simple ways to train people to become more comfortable and proficient at it. For example, question formulation exercises can be used as a substitute for conventional brainstorming sessions. The idea is to put a problem or challenge in front of a group of people and instead of asking for ideas, instruct participants to generate as many relevant questions as they can. Kristi Schaffner, an executive at Microsoft, regularly conducts such exercises there and says they sharpen analytical skills.Getting employees to ask more questions is the easy part; getting management to respond well to those questions can be harder. When leaders claim they want \u201ceveryone to ask more questions,\u201d I sometimes (in my bolder moments) ask: \u201cDo you really want that? And what will you do with those questions once people start asking them?\u201dFor questioning to thrive in a company, management must find ways to reward the behavior \u2014 if only by acknowledging the good questions that have been asked. For example, I visited one company that asked all employees to think of \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201chow might we\u201d questions about the company\u2019s goals and plans. Management and employees together decided which of these mission questions were best, then displayed them on banners on the walls.Leaders can also encourage companywide questioning by being more curious and inquisitive themselves. This is not necessarily easy for senior executives, who are used to being the ones with the answers. I\u2019ve noticed during questioning exercises at some companies that top executives sit in the back of the room, laptops open, attending to other business; they seem to think their employees are the only ones who need to learn. As they do this, these leaders are modeling precisely the kind of incurious behavior they\u2019re trying to change in others.They could set a better example by asking \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u201d \u2014 while asking others to do likewise. And as the questions proliferate, some good answers are likely to follow.WARREN BERGER is the author of \u201cA More Beautiful Question\u201d (Bloomsbury USA).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Character, Fate and Yahoo", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byBitsYahoo, we hardly knew ye.But then again, ye hardly knew yourself.It is hardly a surprising turn. Yahoo is 21 years old, and for more than half its life people have wondered if the company could get the magic back. More than anything, that is a mark of the good will Silicon Valley long held for the company, and its seemingly boyish founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo.For many, not least shareholders, Yahoo would have been better off taking Microsoft\u2019s $44.6 billion bid in 2008, which is almost $50 billion in today\u2019s money. The company is now valued at $35 billion, and the figure is that high only because in February Yahoo decided to sell its core assets (around the same time it announced a big layoff).When so much has gone wrong to something once so seemingly wonderful, one ascribes bad luck, and bad management. When it happens over so many years, under so many different leaders, however, it\u2019s also worth asking whether there wasn\u2019t also some flaw of character, or what in corporate terms is called culture.The Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs reportedly told Yahoo early in the millennium that it had to decide whether it was a tech company or a content company. This was a sensible and profound point, and something Yahoo never accomplished.That may be because content and tech were always contending at Yahoo. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo, two engineers, started out by pointing out cool sites on the young World Wide Web. Human taste, meet high tech.Tim Koogle, the company\u2019s first chief executive, was a mechanical engineer, and was succeeded by Terry Semel, a Hollywood guy who bragged that he didn\u2019t use email. Thereafter, \u201cWhat are we?\u201d was a question Yahoo\u2019s leaders seemed to be perpetually addressing.Human curators at Yahoo, eventually an entire building full of them, tried to apply taste and by-hand content organization of the web even as the web exploded. The two companies Yahoo most famously missed buying \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 were far more successful bypassing human organization, and finding algorithms that worked on things like page links and social posts.If you had to choose between tech and content, clearly tech was the superior way to go (if for no other reason than there was no great content company in Silicon Valley). But that implies that Yahoo could have chosen.Maybe Mr. Jobs was wrong, inasmuch as Yahoo couldn\u2019t actually make the kind of choice he demanded of it. It was always a bit of both things, and seems to have collapsed under this, and many other contradictions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 For more than a decade, Silicon Valley\u2019s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie.Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a \u201cLike\u201d button.The shift was evident in a Lowe\u2019s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries.The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.Silicon Valley\u2019s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing self-driving cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a half-dozen types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized.\u201cWe saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom \u2014 there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,\u201d said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco.Funding in A.I. start-ups has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1.2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year.\u201cWhenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,\u201d said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. \u201cBut you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don\u2019t happen every day.\u201dSilicon Valley\u2019s new A.I. era underscores the region\u2019s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend.\u201cThis is at the heart of the region\u2019s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. \u201cThe valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning.\u201dThe change spurred a rush for talent in A.I. that has become intense.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. \u201cThe number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy.\u201dThe valley\u2019s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region\u2019s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a consumer-electronics manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the mid-1970s. A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet.A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would \u2014 for at least another generation \u2014 remain the world\u2019s innovation center.How far the A.I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today\u2019s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have human-level intelligence.Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A.I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of start-ups. Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the \u201cA.I. Winter.\u201dThe current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong.\u201cThere is no chance of a new winter,\u201d said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence start-ups.John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A.I. companies. \u201cYou get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,\u201d he said.For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A.I. companies in the 1980s \u2014 Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down \u2014 the Valley\u2019s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered.\u201cSometimes when I hang around with A.I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Yahoo Ruled the Valley: Stories of the Original \u2018Surfers\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Back in the mid-1990s, before Google even existed, the world\u2019s best guides to the internet sat in Silicon Valley cubicles, visiting websites and carefully categorizing them by hand.They were called surfers, and they were a collection of mostly 20-somethings \u2014 including a yoga lover, an ex-banker, a divinity student, a recent college grad from Ohio hungry for adventure \u2014 all hired by a start-up called Yahoo to build a directory of the world\u2019s most interesting websites.Today, with more than one billion websites across the globe, the very notion seems mad. Even then, there was a hint of insanity about the enterprise.Two decades after Yahoo\u2019s founding \u2014 the equivalent of several lifetimes in Silicon Valley \u2014 Elvis still serenades the surfers at the headquarters here in Sunnyvale, and Yahoo is at a crossroads. The company, long since eclipsed by Google and Facebook, now commands just a tiny fraction of people\u2019s attention and advertisers\u2019 dollars.Yahoo is auctioning itself off. Bids are due on Monday, the same day the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is expected to report yet another quarter of dismal financial results.Most, but not all, of the surfers have scattered across Silicon Valley and the world. The careers of some followed the arc of the tech world\u2019s obsessions and idiosyncrasies over the last 20 years. Others took their stock windfalls and dropped out to pursue other passions. Taken together, the surfers, about 10 of whom are still in the building, embody the technological and cultural changes that transformed the valley and the world \u2014 and left Yahoo in the dust.Back in 1994, when the directory was born, search engines were rudimentary and ineffectual. Newbies were just learning how to navigate the World Wide Web. The very idea of a website was novel.Two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, saw opportunity. Working from a trailer on campus, they began compiling websites into a list, organized by topic. They eventually named it Yahoo, an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.It quickly became one of the most important gateways to the web. The value proposition was simple, said one longtime surfer, Dave Sikula: \u201cWe\u2019ve done the work for you \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through the web and these are the best sites.\u201dThat required an army of people, said Srinija Srinivasan, employee No. 5 at Yahoo, who was hired to build the original surfer team.It was serious work, deciding how to label things and where to put them. What do you call a category that includes skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan? What kind of pornography should be considered for inclusion, given that \u201csex\u201d was the most popular search term from the start?Much was left to individual judgment. Matthew Mustapick, who quit a job at Wells Fargo to become a surfer in 1995, recalled creating the \u201ccannibalism\u201d category. He found sites explaining how to butcher a human body but decided they were too distasteful to include.Amey Mathews, who worked as a Yahoo surfer from 1998 to 2002 (and is now married to Mr. Mustapick), discovered in the course of her work that the Irish originally carved their jack-o\u2019-lanterns from turnips, not pumpkins. After that, the surfers held a turnip-carving contest every Halloween.The directory survived until 2014. But by then, most of the surfers\u2019 time already went to other projects. Many of them worked to improve Yahoo\u2019s search engine as it battled with Alphabet\u2019s Google subsidiary. Still, Yahoo\u2019s star continued to fade, particularly with the rise of smartphones and social applications like Facebook and Twitter.Today, some former surfers ponder the company\u2019s fate with sadness and a hint of regret at opportunities missed. \u201cYahoo Mail is still my primary email. My home page is still My Yahoo. I still look at the sports page,\u201d said Mr. Sikula, who is a stage director and freelance editor after being laid off in 2010 as part of a big surfer cutback.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know why the company exists. And I think that\u2019s what they are trying to figure out, too.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t chosen to study Japanese at Stanford, Srinija Srinivasan would never have found herself in charge of building Yahoo\u2019s directory into a guide to the internet for a curious world.Ms. Srinivasan, who grew up in Kansas, was an undergraduate attending a tech-focused Stanford program in Kyoto, Japan, when she got to know two fellow students over shared meals \u2014 Jerry Yang and David Filo. After graduation, she was working on the Cyc Project, an early effort to create artificial intelligence, when the pair asked her to help them turn their directory into a real company.\u201cJerry and David knew that I alphabetized my CDs,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan, 44, said in an interview in her Palo Alto, Calif., home. \u201cMy sock drawer is quite beautiful.\u201dWhen she joined, her business card read Ontological Yahoo, a term reflecting her philosophical approach to the job. \u201cThis is not a perfunctory file-keeping exercise. This is defining the nature of being,\u201d she said. \u201cCategories and classifications are the basis for each of our worldviews. \u201dFaced with the vastness of the web, Yahoo surfers hoped to identify the most complete, relevant or interesting sites on a given subject. To choose which topics to focus on, the surfers relied in part on a daily log of visitors\u2019 top queries.Once in a while, surfers made mistakes. For instance, they initially categorized Messianic Judaism as a Jewish sect, failing to notice that its adherents, who follow many Jewish traditions, believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, a defining trait of Christians. \u201cWe had faxes coming in nonstop from rabbis,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said.Yahoo also offered automated search tools by teaming up with various companies, including AltaVista and Google. Eventually, though, Yahoo realized that it had to develop its own version of the technology.Human judgment \u2014 what Mr. Yang referred to as \u201cthe voice of Yahoo\u201d \u2014 remained a core value of the company. When the Grateful Dead musician Jerry Garcia died in August 1995, Yahoo searches on him spiked immediately. The surfers put a Garcia link on the home page. \u201cThat was the birth of Yahoo News,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said. Today, it remains one of the most popular online news portals.The surfers\u2019 role as corporate conscience expanded with the company. They worked on a child-safe version of Yahoo, called Yahooligans. They selected the news headlines worthy of home-page display. Over time, Ms. Srinivasan and her team even fielded questions like how much cleavage to allow on home-page ads.Despite its efforts, Yahoo kept losing ground to Google in search. Microsoft made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy the weakened company in 2008. Ms. Srinivasan left two years later, soon after Mr. Yang stepped down as chief executive. \u201cIn Japan, they have a saying: Leave when the cherry blossoms are full,\u201d she said.She also sits on the board of trustees of her alma mater, Stanford, a school that has churned out several generations of Silicon Valley moguls. But unlike many former technology executives, Ms. Srinivasan focuses her attention there on the arts and humanities.\u201cTech is sexy. It\u2019s employable. Parents love it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that isn\u2019t worth a hill of beans unless we know why, to what end. We call it the humanities for a reason.\u201dYahoo, like the early web itself, was largely focused on American content. But it had global ambitions. Seana Meek, an Alberta native and a single mother, was working for Futurekids, which taught children computer basics, when Yahoo hired her to organize the Canadian sites in its directory.For Ms. Meek personally, it kicked off a 20-year career odyssey through modern Silicon Valley and some of the tech industry\u2019s most significant trends: e-commerce, virtual reality, fraud-fighting \u2014 even a mobile haircut app.When she started, Yahoo was fumbling in Canada. Technically, it had a separate Canada site, but it relied on the American directory for its searches.Employees asked her why the most popular search term among Canadian users was the word Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d Ms. Meek, 41, recalled saying. \u201cIn Canada, you do \u2018government\u2019 and you get American results. So you do \u2018government Canada.\u2019 You do anything and then you add \u2018Canada\u2019 to it.\u201dAfter the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Yahoo\u2019s dysfunctions began to surface. In 2002, the company transferred Ms. Meek\u2019s job to Toronto. Less than 90 days later, it closed that office and sent her and two engineers back to the American headquarters.She got a promotion from the mess: Yahoo put her in charge of the content, ads and business deals for Yahoo Canada. She was nicknamed Captain Canada and had a ringside seat to one of the company\u2019s biggest decisions \u2014 dumping Google as a search partner and switching to technology from its Inktomi acquisition instead. \u201cThey were scared to do it. So they did it in Canada first,\u201d she said.In 2008, she left the company, embarking on a journey through Silicon Valley\u2019s laboratory of business ideas, big and small. First she joined a tiny start-up, Picateers, that was trying to reinvent the school portrait business. It folded a year later.From there she went to Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, the tech industry\u2019s first big foray into virtual reality. Players interacted with one another online in a 3-D simulated world, where they could buy and sell things, make friends, or just gawk at the scenery.Second Life was an extraordinary experiment in human behavior, she said. An employee could change something in the virtual world, then just watch what happened. \u201cYou are literally a god,\u201d she said.Next for her was Eventbrite, an online event-planning and ticketing company. There she worked to protect against credit card fraud.And she says, she is casting about for the next challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny time in my life where there is definitely no script,\u201d she said.Working long hours in close quarters, it was inevitable that some surfers would find romance.For Matthew Mustapick and Amey Mathews, working at Yahoo didn\u2019t just lead to love. The lessons they learned \u2014 and the money they made from the stock they received as early employees \u2014 allowed them to achieve a different kind of Silicon Valley dream: dropping out of tech to do their own thing.Ms. Mathews, who had a fine arts degree from Stanford, joined in 1998 after responding to an ad looking for a speaker of Scandinavian languages. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t speak any Scandinavian languages \u2014 but I speak Italian and you should have someone who speaks Italian,\u201d she recalled during an interview at the couple\u2019s home in Soquel, Calif.Yahoo had an Italian speaker already, but she got a job anyway. Mr. Mustapick sat in a nearby cubicle, and they eventually became a couple.Surfers were free to reflect their personal interests in the directory. Ms. Mathews loved animals and indexed all the dogs, cattle, even miniature donkeys, she could find. Mr. Mustapick was fond of cataloging oddities like prosthetic testicles for pets that had been neutered.Mr. Mustapick left Yahoo in early 2002. Ms. Mathews followed later that year.\u201cI could afford to lose money for a whole year when no one came to my class,\u201d she said.Mr. Mustapick turned toward music. \u201cI always wanted to learn how to play electric guitar like Scott Henderson,\u201d he said, referring to the jazz and blues guitarist. That interest led him in an unexpected direction \u2014 he began building acoustic guitars with an eye toward selling them.Having looked at hundreds of thousands of websites while at Yahoo, he had a good sense of how to market online, well before the era of Twitter and self-promotion as a national pastime. He built a website and posted photos of guitars he was building so customers could watch the progress.And he consciously befriended the right people. \u201cThey just put the word out for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the sort of thing I learned at Yahoo that you could do.\u201dStill, she remembers Yahoo fondly. \u201cI loved being around that many smart, interesting, engaged people,\u201d she said. \u201cI actively miss that in my daily life \u2014 not enough to go get a job and give up what I\u2019m doing, but I do miss it.\u201dNine years ago, Gordon Hurd quit Yahoo for the second time. In June, he began working for the company again \u2014 Round 3 \u2014 this time as a freelance writer.In the intervening years, Mr. Hurd toured the struggling new-media landscape \u2014 first, the Yahoo archrival AOL; then, Interactive One, a network of black news and culture sites; later, First Look Media, created by the eBay founder Pierre M. Omidyar; and most recently, a men\u2019s fashion site, Man\u2019s Life. There was even a brief stint at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm and \u201cthe most corporate place you could go,\u201d he said.Mr. Hurd\u2019s first run with Yahoo started in 1998 when he was hired to organize the business and finance parts of the directory. The starting pay was only $35,000 a year, he recalled. But there were stock options.\u201cI didn\u2019t make millions by any means,\u201d said Mr. Hurd, 45, in a phone interview from Brooklyn, where he lives. But he bought a house.A restless soul, he left Yahoo in 2002 to become an investigative reporter for a local magazine. Less than a year later, with a second child on the way, Mr. Hurd returned to Yahoo, eventually helping run the influential home page.In 2007, he hopped to McKinsey and then quickly to AOL, where he ran Asylum.com, a lifestyle site aimed at men age 18 to 34. The business model was to create vast amounts of content in the hope that visitors would click on ads.That didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWhat it underlined is how much of a commodity content was,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. Asylum was shut down.Mr. Hurd moved on to Interactive One, the digital arm of Radio One, the largest black-owned radio broadcaster in the United States, which struggled to crack the content code, too. Volume trumped quality. \u201cYou know people will click on a subway-fight video, but you want to talk about what it\u2019s like to be a millennial of color,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.Which is how, today, Mr. Hurd is back at Yahoo, writing articles for its style site while he ponders his next move.More than ever, he thinks there is a need for the type of work that Yahoo\u2019s surfers did 20 years ago. \u201cThe web has gotten so big that you need people to curate it,\u201d he said.However, he sees that curation coming from subject experts, not mass-audience sites like Yahoo. Niche sites with a devoted following could work with select sponsors hoping to reach a particular audience, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019s really dedicated to the art of handmade knives, and you set out to categorize the sites of handmade knives, only you can do that. Google can never do that,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.When Becky Uline graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio in 1996, she didn\u2019t really know what she wanted to do with her life. A friend was raving that he had discovered paradise \u2014 living in Northern California and working for a company few people had ever heard of, Yahoo.She and another Bowling Green graduate, Michelle Heimburger, thought it would be a grand adventure. They both got hired as surfers and rented an apartment together.The building was so empty at first that surfers would zip through it on in-line skates. \u201cWe would sleep under our desks,\u201d Ms. Uline, 42, recalled during an interview at her current home in Oakland, Calif.In 2001, Ms. Uline gave her notice. She wanted to travel the world, financed in part by her Yahoo nest egg.Paris became a favorite haunt. \u201cI would sublet my apartment out for a few months and just go and work from wherever,\u201d she said. She freelanced for Yahoo and also tapped the vast network of surfer alumni, landing work at the visual-search start-up SearchMe and elsewhere.Yahoo\u2019s decline is sad, Ms. Uline said, but she still feels a connection. Her closest friends are former Yahoos, including Ms. Heimburger, who married yet another surfer and lives in London.A few months ago, Ms. Uline, said, she dropped Yahoo as her home page, but she missed it and changed it back. \u201cI still use Yahoo search. I want them to get the revenue,\u201d she said.When Yahoo set out to hire surfers, it invented a new job category. The closest match may have been bookstore clerk \u2014 and Kepler\u2019s Books in nearby Menlo Park turned into a recruitment hotbed. About a dozen surfers were hired away from the shop, including ConnieAlice Hungate.Ms. Hungate, 46, is still at Yahoo more than 18 years later, supervising what remains of the surfer team. She said the group, renamed content analysis and management, is still vital to the company\u2019s ambitions to remain a player in web search.Search ads bring in nearly half of Yahoo\u2019s revenue. Under a 2010 deal with Microsoft, Yahoo uses Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine for most basic queries and ads.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, has devoted vast resources to search technology \u2014 particularly on mobile devices \u2014 in an attempt to leapfrog Google, though the company has little to show for it so far.Ms. Hungate said her team helped train Yahoo\u2019s search algorithms to provide more relevant results. The mobile search app, for example, now automatically pulls up suggestions for nearby places to eat when lunchtime rolls around.The Elvis sculpture, a 1998 gift from a Yahoo user, still watches over the department, and the turnip-carving contest is held every Halloween \u2014 with results posted on Flickr, the photo-sharing service owned by Yahoo.Ms. Hungate said she was not worried about what would happen to the surfers if the company was sold. \u201cInformation management is a core need in technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll adapt.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philip May, a Financier Who May Find It Harder to Be Low Key", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byPhilip May, Britain\u2019s new first gentleman, has rarely been a man for the limelight. But as a wealthy financier suddenly thrust onto one of the world\u2019s biggest stages, he is quickly confronting the scrutiny that accompanies the modern political power couple.The news had barely broken that Ms. May was taking office when headlines questioning a possible conflict of interest blared in the news media.For now, the optics of the criticism appear to outweigh the substance.Mr. May, a sunny man with a penchant for tailored pinstripe suits and brogues, does not run a rabble-rousing hedge fund that takes major stakes in companies and aggressively demands change from management. His employer is not a big bank that was bailed out by the government. He is not a high-flying, fast-moving trader.The new first man of Britain works at a low-key American investment firm as a client-relationship manager. He no longer invests money, but acts as a go-between with the firm\u2019s clients.Conjugal scrutiny is certainly to be expected, especially when there is the appearance of possible conflict.So far, the handful of dirt thrown at Mr. May has not stuck. The most damning comment to emerge in British news media from colleagues about Mr. May is that he is a fairly \u201chead-down\u201d type of guy, a politically quiet man who is happy to take a back seat.If anything, he has invited comparisons to Sir Denis Thatcher, the low-key husband of Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister.

{"Headline": "Yahoo and the Online Universe According to Verizon", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStill, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is.It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations \u2014 advertisers \u2014 that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so.\u201cTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIt\u2019s to appeal to advertisers in a different way.\u201dAlready, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality.But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizon\u2019s existing assets \u2014 phone and data networks that knit together the nation \u2014 might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website \u201cfor the modern bride.\u201dLocation information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well \u2014 all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizon\u2019s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley.And Verizon is eager to change the narrative.Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizon\u2019s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce.Everything about the old-school street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become.Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160,000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans.That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike.This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits.That\u2019s why Lowell McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s empire retention,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and Pok\u00e9mon.It\u2019s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizon\u2019s main moneymaking activity \u2014 selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers.\u201cThere\u2019s not really any synergy between Verizon\u2019s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals.Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues.A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5.5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year.But other new ventures haven\u2019t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizon\u2019s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing.Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isn\u2019t clear. Though the companies aren\u2019t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldn\u2019t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the company\u2019s annual sales.\u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new,\u201d said Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. \u201cPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dMr. Armstrong\u2019s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizon\u2019s forays have already landed the company in hot water.The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew.\u201cThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,\u201d said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it.\u201dGiving advertisers access to smartphone users\u2019 data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesn\u2019t take many complaints to get hauled before the F.C.C.\u201dAnd in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a Verizon-owned site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. \u201cThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,\u201d Mr. Gillula said.Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a well-trafficked home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it co-owns Complex, a men\u2019s lifestyle website.Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted location-based advertising informed by the movements of Verizon\u2019s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the so-called internet of things \u2014 where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web \u2014 augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right industry.\u201dAdvertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. \u201cWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,\u201d said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks.\u201cAdvertisers want to make it work,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interest in supporting and propping up a well-run No. 3.\u201dYet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is \u201cwillful optimism,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger.At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1.2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers.And even if Verizon\u2019s push into digital media doesn\u2019t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo.For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,\u201d said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade.How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation.What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isn\u2019t clear.Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street.So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesn\u2019t regularly break out AOL\u2019s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Charges in Europe Need Quick Action", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe European Commission has hit Google with a third antitrust charge. This time it says the tech company abused its search dominance on third-party websites. It also reinforced a claim, first made in 2010, that Google favored its own shopping service.A speedier, more focused campaign would better serve justice.The newest charge hits closest to the heart of Google\u2019s empire. The company makes about 90 percent of its revenue from advertising. The commission claims Google acted anti-competitively by forcing onerous contracts on companies that used its search service on their sites. For example, a newspaper would use the service to let readers search its archive, or a retailer would allow shoppers to look for merchandise. These partners were obliged to prominently place a minimum number of ads served by Google and were forbidden to use rival search companies to place ads.Google\u2019s 80 percent share of this market gives it plenty of power to act abusively. These contracts, as well as provisions requiring third parties to receive Google\u2019s approval before making any change to the display of competing search ads, skirted the line and may have overstepped it.The commission is confronting Google on other fronts. It accuses the company of forcing handset manufacturers using its Android operating system to install Google apps and bundle services and apps together. That\u2019s a potentially strong case, as similar behavior landed Microsoft in trouble.Then there\u2019s the charge that Google favors its own comparison shopping services. The commission has now added more evidence to its underwhelming claims. There is little evidence consumers were harmed, and it is a minor service for the search giant. Yet regulators have pursued this charge since 2010. The newest charges add yet more time to the clock, giving Google another eight weeks to reply.That is a long time, considering the speed with which the tech market shifts. Facebook has tripled its active users and multiplied its revenue ninefold during the commission\u2019s inquiry into Google\u2019s shopping service. Regulators need to be thorough, but they also must hit companies fast and hard with strong charges aimed at the heart of abusive business practices. The commission\u2019s slow and scattered approach is an ineffective way to curb tech monopolies.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

You pick it up when you\u2019re sitting opposite a C.E.O.\u201dThe visits help the eight portfolio managers develop broad networks of contacts in their industries that can lead them to investments.Such knowledge helped Federated Kaufmann decide to invest in Tesaro, a Waltham, Mass., biotech company.
