{"Headline": "The Fully Self-Driving Car Is Still Years Away", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byEven as automakers and technology companies have been promoting a euphoric vision of the future in which cars will drive themselves and serious crashes will be rare, their engineers have been engaged in a sobering debate.Just how autonomous can and should cars become? the engineers are asking. Is there an inherent danger in technology that invites human drivers to sit back and relax \u2014 but still requires them to be ready to hit the brakes or grab the wheel at the first sign of trouble?Those questions have taken on a new urgency after the revelation this week that the driver of a Tesla Model S died in a crash in Florida while the electric car was operating in its Autopilot mode.The man, Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was driving on a divided highway, when a tractor-trailer truck made a left turn and crossed in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s lane of traffic. Tesla said neither Mr. Brown nor the car\u2019s self-driving system noticed the white truck against a bright sky, and the brakes were never applied.For now, other automakers are giving no sign of slowing down their efforts to push forward with cars that can drive themselves. But mainly they say the technology isn\u2019t ready yet \u2014 which for many is an implicit rebuke of Tesla\u2019s willingness to tempt tech-minded drivers to turn tomorrow\u2019s vision into today\u2019s road reality.On Friday, even as the world was absorbing news of Mr. Brown\u2019s death as the first known fatality of the autonomous driving revolution, the German automaker BMW said it intended to offer a \u201cself-driving car\u201d \u2014 but not until 2021. And it will have much different technology than is now available on the Tesla Model S.\u201cToday we are standing at the brink of a new revolution,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, BMW chief executive, said at a news conference in Munich.Mr. Kr\u00fcger added that the Tesla crash was \u201creally very sad\u201d and said BMW would need \u201cthe next few years\u201d to perfect its autonomous driving system. \u201cToday the technologies are not ready for serious production,\u201d he said.The world\u2019s largest carmaker, Toyota, is a notable holdout in the rush toward completely autonomous cars. Last year, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in a Silicon Valley-based research effort to focus on cars that will function as \u201cguardian angels,\u201d saving human drivers from errors, rather than replacing them.Tesla, which started its Autopilot feature last fall, has emphasized in discussing Mr. Brown\u2019s death that the system isn\u2019t intended to take over complete control of the car and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert and engaged.The point highlights the difference in approach that separates companies working on self-driving technology.Ford Motor, Google, Volvo and others are aiming at offering fully autonomous cars that can operate safely without human intervention at all \u2014 an approach engineers call Level 4 automated driving. Those companies are wary of semiautonomous, or Level 3, technology that can drive the car for stretches of road under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to be ready to take over.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is not even a fully fledged Level 3 technology, and some experts say it is a risky approach.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge inherent danger and it\u2019s well proven \u2014 the computer making a mistake and the driver not taking over quickly enough,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice.The trouble is that while semiautonomous systems like Tesla\u2019s are guiding a car, human drivers can be lulled into feeling they are able to turn their attention away from the road. Mr. Brown, like some other Model S owners, posted videos showing the driver with no hands on the steering wheel. In one video, a driver climbs into the back seat.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending machine company from Connellsville, Pa., owns a 2013 Model S that does not have Autopilot. But he drove a loaner with the feature earlier this year while his was being repaired. He loves his car and has deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when that car is available, yet he is \u201con the fence\u201d about getting Autopilot.While the technology \u201cwas the greatest thing\u201d on closed highways like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it could become confused in more complicated environments like construction zones, Mr. Cordaro said.\u201cMy experience is it\u2019s really not completely safe except in limited-access highways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives you a false sense of security. You get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel but you really can\u2019t. It should be called Auto-assist, instead of Autopilot, because that\u2019s all it is.\u201dEven Amnon Shashua, an executive whose technology is part of Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature, said on Friday that he did not think self-driving\u2019s time had yet come.Mobileye, along with the chip maker Intel, is at work in a partnership with BMW on the self-driving car that the German automaker described in Munich on Friday that is supposed to be available in 2021.Mr. Shashua suggested that self-driving technology was close, but still not quite ready for actual use without human drivers remaining engaged.\u201cFive years is a very short time,\u201d Mr. Shashua said. \u201cOn the other hand, it is a sufficient time to do the types of validations that are needed.\u201dThe BMW car Mobileye is collaborating on will be capable of piloting itself on highways, but not necessarily in complex urban settings.Automakers and technology companies still need to do \u201chundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers of validation and simulations\u201d in closed testing environments to be certain the technology is safe, Mr. Shashua said.\u201cI think it is very important, especially given this accident and what we hear in the news, that companies are very transparent about the limitations of the system,\u201d he said.Although Tesla has publicly said that it has enhanced the Mobileye technology, the company has not commented on whether it has enhanced the system to protect against what the industry describes as \u201clateral turn across path\u201d\u2014 the type of situation in the Florida accident.Others in the automotive industry are working on sensor technologies meant to detect vehicles from all angles.One approach is lidar \u2014 a system that uses rotating laser beams. Lidar is being used in the experimental autonomous vehicle being developed by BMW, as well as those by Google, Nissan and Apple. But it remains unclear whether the laser system will come down enough in price to use in mass-market cars.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It was a real psychological malady, the \u201cdizzying disorientation brought on by the premature arrival of the future.\u201d And \u201cunless intelligent steps are taken to combat it,\u201d he warned, \u201cmillions of human beings will find themselves increasingly disoriented, progressively incompetent to deal rationally with their environments.\u201dYet in rereading Mr. Toffler\u2019s book, as I did last week, it seems clear that his diagnosis has largely panned out, with local and global crises arising daily from our collective inability to deal with ever-faster change.In many large ways, it\u2019s almost as if we have collectively stopped planning for the future. Instead, we all just sort of bounce along in the present, caught in the headlights of a tomorrow pushed by a few large corporations and shaped by the inescapable logic of hyper-efficiency \u2014 a future heading straight for us. It\u2019s not just future shock; we now have future blindness.It didn\u2019t have to come to this. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as the American government began to spend huge sums in the Cold War, futurists became the high priests of the coming age. Forecasting became institutionalized; research institutes like RAND, SRI and MITRE worked on long-range projections about technology, global politics and weaponry, and world leaders and businesses took their forecasts as seriously as news of the present day.In 1972, the federal government even blessed the emerging field of futurism with a new research agency, the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which reviewed proposed legislation for its long-term effects. Futurists were optimistic about lawmakers\u2019 new interest in the long term.\u201c\u2018Futurist\u2019 always sounded like this weird, made-up, science-fiction term,\u2019\u201d Ms. Webb said, even though in its early years, people were doing deep, nuanced research on how various tech and social movements would shape the world.The end of the Cold War and a rise in partisan political interests also changed how lawmakers saw the utility of looking at the future. In the Reagan years, many on the right began to see the government as the cause of most of the nation\u2019s ills. The idea that the government could do something as difficult as predict the future came to be considered a ridiculous waste of money.Yet without soliciting advice from a class of professionals charged with thinking systematically about the future, we risk rushing into tomorrow headlong, without a plan.\u201cIt is ridiculous that the United States is one of the only nations of our size and scope in the world that no longer has an office that is dedicated to rigorous, nonpartisan research about the future,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t do that is insane.\u201dOr, as Mr. Toffler put it in \u201cFuture Shock,\u201d \u201cChange is avalanching upon our heads and most people are grotesquely unprepared to cope with it.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World According to \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "FeatureThe show\u2019s creators have turned the travails of an anthropomorphic horse into a hilarious meditation on a peculiarly modern kind of unhappiness.Supported byThe first story described how Theodore Roosevelt handed the presidency to William Howard Taft. Displeased with Taft\u2019s performance, Roosevelt made a bid to regain the White House in 1912, which ended in a humiliating defeat. \u201cHe goes from being the most important person in the world to being a kind of fool,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. Roosevelt soon redeemed himself by embarking on a journey down a remote river in the Amazon. Eisner related Roosevelt\u2019s story to his own career: \u201cFor 40 years, I\u2019m the most important man in the room, and all of a sudden I thought the phone is never going to ring.\u201dWhich led him to his second parable of the evening, a tale about a figure somewhat less well known than the 26th president: the protagonist of an animated TV show that Eisner\u2019s production company, Tornante, had sold to Netflix. The show, \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d is about an anthropomorphic horse living in Los Angeles who suffers with existential, career and substance-abuse issues after the death of his sitcom.\u201cBoJack wants you to think he\u2019s still the most important person in the room,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. \u201cBut deep down, he knows he\u2019s not, and that is killing him.\u201d He tries to write his memoirs, but can\u2019t get started. Paparazzi birds torment him. He endures a withering mare of a mother and a Harvard-educated, name-dropping former writing partner named Cuddlywhiskers. He betrays everyone who tries to love him.The lesson for Bloomberg? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be sure you\u2019re not going to be embarrassed,\u201d Eisner said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t go dark.\u201dIt helps that \u201cBoJack\u201d is also funny. In the tradition of great melan-comedy predecessors like \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d and \u201cLouie,\u201d \u201cBoJack\u201d bites the hand that feeds it. Eisner claims the show is not just a Hollywood satire (\u201cNo one watches those\u201d), but it is centered on the travails of an actor for whom the trappings of success \u2014 money, a convertible, nubile fans \u2014 don\u2019t begin to make up for his has-been status.Superficially, the show is full of Sitcom 101 characters. There\u2019s the millennial wastrel Todd, who moved into BoJack\u2019s house, a modern monstrosity perched on a hill, five years ago and does nothing but eat breakfast cereal and smoke weed. There\u2019s Princess Carolyn, BoJack\u2019s ex/agent/sex buddy whom he disappoints not just romantically but also professionally, turning down every project she brings him. There\u2019s even a built-in frenemy, Mr. Peanutbutter, a yellow lab whose own former show, \u201cMr. Peanutbutter\u2019s House,\u201d was a rip-off of BoJack\u2019s long-running sitcom, \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around,\u201d in which he starred with three lovable orphans. But the characters on \u201cBoJack\u201d are deeper, and more complex, than those descriptions suggest. Todd, as his voice actor, Aaron Paul, says, may be \u201cthe first asexual character on television,\u201d and his loyalty to BoJack is often rewarded with heartbreaking indifference. Princess Carolyn is whip-smart, but her window to have kittens is closing; this she periodically regrets, blaming BoJack. And the more we watch Mr. Peanutbutter, the more apparent it is that, despite his career thievery, he\u2019s the simplest and most decent character on the show. All are at once infatuated with and repelled by BoJack.Still, for all this misanthropy and unremitting bleakness, BoJack retains our sympathy, especially as we see him wrestle with the damage inflicted by his twisted childhood. The offspring of a plow horse and a moody equine heiress to a sugar fortune, BoJack is raised primarily by network television, which he watches incessantly, even as his mother lectures him about how life is nothing but a pile of road apples. Like Sanders, BoJack just wants to be loved. The penultimate episode of the first season ends with BoJack\u2019s confronting the ghostwriter of his memoirs with an aching plea: \u201cI need you to tell me that I\u2019m a good person. ... Please, Diane, tell me that I\u2019m good.\u201d Before she can answer, a heckler interrupts, and the screen goes black.It\u2019s easy to assume that \u201cBoJack\u201d had its origins in the creative travails of 40-something television writers. But the idea actually sprang from the youthful angst of the show\u2019s creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg. Bob-Waksberg and his two younger sisters were raised in Palo Alto, Calif., by what he calls \u201ctwo professional Jews.\u201d His father helped Russian Jews emigrate from the Soviet Union; his mother owned a Jewish bookstore with his grandmother. He insists that his parents were the opposite of the stereotypically hard-charging Palo Alto parent \u2014 to whom some attributed the spate of suicides that have rocked Bob-Waksberg\u2019s high school in recent years \u2014 but he still struggled.He was repeatedly kicked out of class for being disruptive. When the principal refused to let him wear his beloved cycling cap in a school picture, he retaliated by shaving half his head on the quad. (He\u2019d already done the other half, which had given him a disturbing half-cherub-half-psycho look.) He missed field trips because he was sent to the principal\u2019s office so many times and ran with a group of \u201clike-minded weirdos,\u201d moving through the hallways with a frenetic, loud energy.There was a downside to his teenage charisma. Bob-Waksberg often pushed his jokes over the line, making his sister Becky and friends cry in frustration. \u201cI definitely have people who I went to high school with who would call me a bully,\u201d said Bob-Waksberg, who, at 31, still has the intense, spritelike energy of an adolescent. \u201cI would find something and tease them, which in my mind was harmless fun. And then they would go home and be like, Why is he so mean to me?\u201dAcademically, he floundered, but he sometimes won the lead in the school\u2019s theater productions, which led to his hanging out with a girl named Lisa Hanawalt, now the production designer and a producer on \u201cBoJack.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d riff on ideas for a TV show based on people we knew,\u201d Hanawalt remembers. \u201cWe\u2019d use that to make fun of them. Like, \u2018Oh, what if our friend was a pirate and he had a chicken on his shoulder instead of a parrot?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe two parted for college \u2014 Hanawalt, first, to U.C.L.A., then Bob-Waksberg to Bard \u2014 but stayed in touch, working on a comic via email. Within a decade, Hanawalt was a critically acclaimed illustrator and comics artist and Bob-Waksberg was making his way in Hollywood writing scripts, including one about three liars that morphed into a pilot about triplets. In 2010, he finally had an idea he really wanted to pursue, and he emailed Hanawalt.\u201cHey, do you have a picture of one of your horse guys, by himself? I came up with this idea for a show I\u2019d like to pitch. Tell me what you think: \u2018BoJack, the Depressed Talking Horse.\u2019\u2009\u201dAt first, Hanawalt thought the BoJack idea sounded sad and cynical, but she liked the horse part. As a kid, Hanawalt was so obsessed with horses that she sometimes walked on all fours. Her classmates called her Horse Poop and Lady Horse. After graduating from U.C.L.A., she cre\u00adated a comic book called \u201cExtra Egg Room\u201d about He-Horse, an anxiety-ridden horse. In another, she created She-Moose, an artist moose who lives with her boyfriend, a cat. She didn\u2019t draw on computers, so she did a series of watercolors of the main characters for \u201cBoJack.\u201d She advised Bob-Waksberg to make everything more animal-centric, suggesting that a Newton\u2019s Cradle in Princess Carolyn\u2019s office be strung with clanging mice instead of balls. BoJack\u2019s look came to her almost instantly \u2014 a mournful horse, too young to be wearing the Cosby sweaters he favors. She envisioned Diane as a bookish, Janeane Garofalo type. Hanawalt and her staff also provided many of the show\u2019s punning touches. Princess Carolyn\u2019s bookshelf includes the titles \u201cPurrity\u201d and \u201cPurrsepolis.\u201d Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s estate features a fire hydrant and countless portraits of dog butts and tennis balls.But BoJack still lives in a harsh realm. In the first five minutes of the first episode, he shows up drunk to a \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d interview and defends \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around.\u201d \u201cI think the show is actually pretty solid for what it is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not Ibsen, sure, but look \u2014 for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra. Sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes everything is going to turn out O.K.\u201dBob-Waksberg manages a staff of nearly 100, but he drives a silver Prius that Eisner gave him after it became clear he would never dump his beat-up Dodge. He is a slight man, who despite his biting humor still cries at Hallmark-card commercials; his blue eyes dart constantly, as if he\u2019s thinking three moves ahead. He and Arnett eventually got down to reading lines for a scene in which BoJack thinks he has nabbed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Secretariat in a biopic. BoJack should be ecstatic, but told of the nomination, he just mutters, \u201cI feel the same.\u201dArnett read the line a few times in BoJack\u2019s most-important-horse-in-the-room baritone before Bob-Waksberg interrupted.\u201cSay it disappointed and weirded out.\u201dArnett added a pause and a note of bewildered anguish.\u201cI feel ... the same.\u201dThey moved on to the next line, which Bob-Waksberg asked Arnett to do with \u201cmore bouncy energy. \u2018It\u2019s happening again. Jesus Christ, I\u2019ll never be happy. Typical me.\u2019\u2009\u201dArnett nods.\u201cIt\u2019s happening again. ... Why do I always think things will make me happy?\u201dBob-Waksberg jolted his head up. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dWhen Arnett finished recording, he told me that what drew him to BoJack was that the horse was kind of a jackass. \u201cI love a flawed character more than anything.\u201dSuddenly, an eager assistant bolted through the door. She wanted to make sure Arnett\u2019s lunch order had been taken.\u201cThat was so Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got interrupted having a real conversation and asked what we wanted for lunch.\u201d We talked about the show for a while before Arnett steered the conversation to the crushing nature of Hollywood. \u201cThe brass ring here is so shiny and so big, and the possibilities endless. So people come here because they want to be a star, whatever that means \u2014 that is the pinnacle. So when it doesn\u2019t happen, bad things tend to happen.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see myself having grandchildren with her,\u201d he replied, with BoJackian dourness.\u201cI love Raphael,\u201d Conover, who now has his own comedy show on TruTV, told me. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy being a Mr. Peanutbutter type, because having that BoJack mentality where you\u2019re constantly processing things can\u2019t be easy.\u201dBut this churning over the meaning of existence has always defined Bob-Waksberg\u2019s comedy. In Olde English, an absurdist comedy troupe he and Conover joined at Bard, Bob-Waksberg often played the role of a clueless yet self-righteous millennial. The group was successful and cutthroat; it would meet often to jettison members who weren\u2019t carrying their weight, with one member ordered to deliver the blow. \u201cThe ultimate pejorative was if you came up with something and someone else described it as corny,\u201d Bob-Waksberg says.After graduating, the Olde English crew migrated to New York and tried to develop ideas. Before calling it quits, they produced some co\u00admedic gems, including a film called \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d a twist on the Surrealists\u2019 parlor game. Each member wrote 15 pages of the script, but the next member saw only the last five. The result is a glorious mess of tone changes and character U-turns interspersed with snippets of commentary. Bob-Waksberg\u2019s section features a speech delivered from a Santa Monica beach days after he moved to Los Angeles. Wearing a tie, he wonders about the project before going global:\u201cHere\u2019s the problem with everything. As soon as you get something you want \u2014 it\u2019s no longer a thing you want, it\u2019s just a thing you have, and then you want the next thing. So I\u2019m starting to realize maybe I\u2019ll never be satisfied. ... I\u2019ll find the girl of my dreams, I\u2019ll get married and I\u2019ll have kids. Then, like a week later, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, this is [expletive].\u2019\u2009\u201dThen a heckler with a football jumps in the frame and ruins the take.The episode opens with scenes of Charlotte\u2019s domestic bliss. When BoJack arrives, he says he\u2019s in town for the Santa Fe boat show and \u2014 to make the lie believable \u2014 buys a yacht that he parks in the driveway. Bob-Waksberg asked an assistant to freeze the screen.\u201cWe knew things were going to break bad here, but the idea was he was going to sleep with Charlotte,\u201d he recalled. Then someone in the writers\u2019 room suggested that BoJack try to bed Penny instead. \u201cOnce that was said out loud, sleeping with Charlotte just felt so boring and expected,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that genie back in the bottle.\u201d I asked him if he polled any outsiders about whether a middle-aged depressive trying to sleep with a high-school senior was over the line. He thought for a second. \u201cA friend left her sweater here, and her assistant came to pick it up, and we asked if it was too much, and she said, \u2018No, I\u2019d go with it,\u2019 and that was it.\u201dAs the episode unfolds, BoJack takes Penny for driving lessons. He contemplates staying and teaching theater at a local college, but this idea is never mentioned again. (The subplot that goes nowhere is something of a Bob-Waksberg trademark.) BoJack magnanimously offers to drive Penny and some friends to the prom. He teaches them that they don\u2019t have to fit in, but then he gets one of them drunk and dumps her at the E.R. with alcohol poisoning. Still, Penny is having a magical evening and is the one to make the first move.\u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m ready, I have condoms in my room, and I know how to put one on with my mouth.\u201d\u201cLast stop for gas,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said, as we watched. \u201cThat\u2019s the last joke of the episode.\u201dBoJack brushes her off and finds Charlotte out back. He tries to talk her into abandoning her family for him. Charlotte tells BoJack he has to leave, not because she is angry but because he makes her too sad. \u201cYou think she says go because he\u2019s messing up her life,\u201d Bob-Waksberg told me. \u201cBut then she goes to this other, existential place \u2014 that\u2019s such a broader critique of BoJack.\u201dBoJack retreats to his boat and finds Penny waiting for him. The camera captures Penny loosening his tie when Charlotte walks in.\u201cIf you are not out of my driveway in 30 minutes, I will call the police. And if you ever try to contact me or my family again, I will [expletive] kill you.\u201d Freeze the frame and you have a still of modern parental horror. The next shot is of BoJack and his boat being towed back to Los Angeles.\u201cIn the writing of it, but then again in the animation of it, in the editing of it, we were really specific about what we were seeing,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said. \u201cOriginally Penny\u2019s top was down, and then it was like, No, that\u2019s too much. Let\u2019s reel back a little bit.\u201dI mentioned that despite the anguish of the episode you never see BoJack wrestle with the gravity of his actions \u2014 there\u2019s no classic moment of \u201cMy God, what have I done?\u201d\u201cWell, his whole life is one nervous breakdown,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said.Someone turned on the lights, and we walked into the studio where dozens of staff members were working. Bob-Waksberg shook his head. \u201cI need some sunlight.\u201dWhen I brought up his speech about the elusive pursuit of happiness in \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d he grimaced. \u201cI thought that was so cutting-edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was on top of my mind, and I still haven\u2019t gotten over that hill.\u201dA few years ago, someone posted on Craigs\u00adlist a missed connection that briefly went viral. A young man on a train spies a beautiful woman in glasses. Their eyes meet, but they say nothing, both missing their stops. This goes on for a very long time.\u201cFor months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of Skittles sold to us by kids raising money for their basketball teams. We must have heard a million mariachi bands, had our faces nearly kicked in by 100,000 break dancers. I gave money to the beggars until I ran out of singles. When the train went above\u00adground, I\u2019d get text messages and voice mails (\u2018Where are you? What happened? Are you O.K.?\u2019) until my phone ran out of battery.\u201dSixty years pass. There are meaningful glances, but the man says nothing. Finally, the now-elderly woman gets off the train; the now-old man stays on and never verbalizes his love.\u201cAnd I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for 60 years and yet still not really know that person at all.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: The Master Plans of SoftBank and Elon Musk", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported bySo, here I am, starting it off. Classic Mike.Point is, we\u2019re going mobile, and ARM has been the best positioned to provide for that future for a long time. SoftBank made a very smart offer.So, what do you think?So Tesla\u2019s strategy seems to be coming from one end of the spectrum rather than the other. Companies like Uber, Lyft and the overseas competitors are busy creating the network from the ground up. That is, they\u2019re plowing money into recruiting drivers and riders \u2014 spinning the flywheel, as one Uber exec told me a while back \u2014 to fully stock up on supply and demand. And they\u2019re doing a good job of it, it seems: Both are unicorns many times over.This Tesla plan essentially seems to come at it from the other end. Build the fleet of cars, but perhaps allow your customers to do much of the real-world testing of how cars adapt to the road \u2014 including using the \u201cautopilot\u201d function, and then autonomous driving comes later on down the line.What I\u2019m curious about is how Tesla builds a network-effect-type service that companies like Uber and Lyft now have critical mass on. Can that come later when the autonomous vehicles are out there? Or do they not even care about a sort of transportation service and just want to give their customers the outright ability to drive hands-free, without worrying about creating an Uber-like demand?The more I think about it, the more I wonder if Uber and Tesla would merge or at least partner somewhere down the line. Uber wants to go autonomous, but I don\u2019t know how it gets there without building its own fleet as well.But that raises some problems: If you don\u2019t need to own a Tesla to ride in one, why would anyone buy one? And also, since as you note this is a network-effects business \u2014 where the biggest fleet will have accelerating advantages in price and efficiency \u2014 why would anyone share their car in Tesla\u2019s fleet rather than in Uber\u2019s, which has a big head-start in sharing?And I think that gets to the bigger problem with Musk\u2019s master plan. It seems a little all over the place, and in many ways far exceeds what Tesla seems capable of doing. Let\u2019s note, after all, that Musk hasn\u2019t even hit all the milestones on his first master plan yet.But I guess setting big, impossible goals is pretty much the point of a visionary master plan. What\u2019s your master plan?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Futuristic Plans Give Shareholders Cause to Worry", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsElon Musk\u2019s new master plan will test the Tesla shareholder faithful. In a blog post late on Wednesday, the electric carmaker\u2019s boss laid out his vision for the next decade or so. He has some compelling ideas: building more vehicle types and increasing autonomous-driving capabilities for a sharing economy. The trouble is that plenty of rivals want a piece of that business, too. And his missive fails to address several more immediate concerns \u2013 not least how to finance his ambitions.Mr. Musk titled his post \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux,\u201d \u2013 a reference to the \u201cSecret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\u201d that he wrote almost 10 years ago to the day. That detailed how he was building an electric sports car to raise money to manufacture family-friendly vehicles. He has largely succeeded, which lessens the conceit of drafting a new outline for the next decade.Unlike in 2006, though, Mr. Musk\u2019s ideas are now mainstream. Larger carmakers have caught on to the appeal of both electric and self-driving vehicles \u2013 as have the likes of Google and Apple. Everyone is grappling with the concept of people sharing private vehicles or using a taxilike fleet.Tesla may have an advantage in some areas. It is, after all, solely committed to electric and autonomous cars while traditional players still concentrate on gasoline engines. But Daimler, Ford, Toyota and others have deep pockets, whereas Tesla is still losing money and has to raise capital just to make sure it has the cash to develop its more affordable Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk\u2019s vision also includes electric passenger buses and heavy-duty trucks. Those are not just expensive propositions; they\u2019re also technologically tough at present as batteries powerful enough to propel them are not yet commercially viable.In the more immediate future, shareholders have another concern: Mr. Musk\u2019s desire to combine Tesla with SolarCity, his home solar panel company. The plan does nothing to allay fears about the motives for the tie-up or the governance issues it raises.Mr. Musk\u2019s determination to think far ahead is a positive and infectious antidote to short-term financial markets. But it is also a stark reminder that shareholders are not even riding shotgun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Safety Agency Investigates Another Tesla Crash Involving Autopilot", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byThe nation\u2019s top auto safety regulator said on Wednesday that it had begun an investigation of a second crash involving a Tesla Motors car equipped with Autopilot technology, a system designed to let vehicles drive themselves for brief periods.The accidents have put new scrutiny on Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system and raised questions about whether the technology, which the company describes as only an experimental \u201cbeta\u201d test, lulls drivers into a false sense of security.An account given on Wednesday by a witness to the Florida accident seemed to indicate that the Autopilot system continued operating the car at highway speed, even after the vehicle\u2019s top was sheared off by the impact and the Tesla went under the trailer and continued down the road.\u201cThe car came from underneath the trailer,\u201d said the witness, Terence Mulligan, who was named in the Florida Highway Patrol\u2019s accident report. Mr. Mulligan, who was driving behind the tractor-trailer at the time, said: \u201cThe top was gone. It went right by me.\u201dMr. Mulligan, in a telephone interview, said he turned and followed the Tesla, which did not slow down until it had left the road, crashed through two fences and hit a utility pole. His account jibed with the accident report by the Florida Highway Patrol, which said the car was traveling at 65 miles per hour when it hit the tractor-trailer.The driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.Tesla has declined to comment on the details of the Florida crash, which is still under investigation by state and federal officials.In a statement on Wednesday about the Pennsylvania crash, Tesla said it had \u201cno reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident\u201d based on the information it had collected so far.The Pennsylvania crash involved a Model X S.U.V. heading east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh. The car scraped a guardrail on the right side of the road, crossed the roadway and hit the concrete median. It then rolled over onto its roof and came to a stop in the middle of the road.Tesla vehicles have the ability to send data back to the company about their condition and operation. In a statement, the company said it received an automated alert from the Model X in Pennsylvania on July 1 showing that its airbags had deployed. But the company said more detailed information about the car\u2019s operation was not received, a situation that could happen if the car\u2019s antenna was damaged in the crash.The Pennsylvania driver, Albert Scaglione, said by phone on Wednesday that he had just been released from the hospital and declined to comment on the accident. \u201cMy attorneys will be releasing a statement shortly,\u201d he said.A passenger in the car, Tim Yanke, was reportedly not seriously injured.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Wednesday that it was collecting information from the Pennsylvania State Police, Tesla and the driver to find out whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.In the Florida crash, charges are pending against Frank Baressi, the driver of the tractor-trailer that was hit by Mr. Brown\u2019s Tesla. But no final determination on charges will be made until the inquiry is complete, Sgt. Kim Montes, a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said on Wednesday.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cWe know the truck made a left turn, and the person going straight has the right of way,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle.Mr. Baressi, reached by phone, declined to comment.In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Mr. Baressi said he had heard a Harry Potter movie playing from Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle, but also acknowledged, \u201cHe went so fast through my trailer, I didn\u2019t see him.\u201dSergeant Montes said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate,\u201d adding, \u201cWe may never know, obviously, given the damage of the vehicle. In a very violent crash, there\u2019s not going to be a lot left inside a car that could be playing.\u201dA DVD player and a laptop computer were recovered from Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle after the crash.Questions have been raised about why neither Tesla nor the federal safety agency notified the public sooner about the May 7 accident, if only to caution other drivers about using Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature.When the federal investigation of Mr. Brown\u2019s accident was disclosed last week, Tesla released a statement saying it had informed the agency of the crash \u201cimmediately after it occurred.\u201dBut in a statement on Tuesday, Tesla said it did not tell the federal agency about the accident until nine days later.The Florida Highway Patrol contacted Tesla, seeking help in downloading data from the car\u2019s so-called black-box recorder, seven to 10 days after the crash.The company said in a statement that it was obligated to notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on a quarterly basis when it became aware of a fatal accident involving a Tesla vehicle.\u201cAs part of its regular ongoing communication and not as part of any formal process, Tesla told N.H.T.S.A. about the accident while it was still in the process of conducting its investigation,\u201d Tesla said. \u201cThis happened on May 16.\u201dAn article on Thursday about an investigation of an accident in Pennsylvania involving a Tesla vehicle being operated in Autopilot mode described incorrectly when Tesla made apparently inconsistent statements about an earlier accident, in Florida. In a company statement released June 30, immediately after the Florida investigation was disclosed, Tesla said it had informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the crash \u201cimmediately after it occurred.\u201d In a statement issued on Tuesday, Tesla said that it did not tell the federal agency about the accident until nine days later. The statement issued on Tuesday did not contain both versions of when Tesla informed the safety agency of the Florida crash.Advertisement"}

Now, the classmate is sprinting out of the park, but the writer has caught her and wrestled her to the ground \u2014 wow, that\u2019s a double nelson, impressive! \u2014 and is demanding her classmate\u2019s email to keep her informed of all her public appearances.I\u2019m glad you understand.

{"Headline": "Stretch of Market Volatility Makes It Stormy at the Top", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe stock market at midyear hovered around a record high. But after several disturbing weeks in which prices soared, then plunged, then soared again, the view from the summit, or near it, may not be so pleasant.Stock fund owners escaped the second quarter with modest gains, but the extreme volatility leaves them to contemplate fresh uncertainties in the final half of 2016.Share prices were advancing steadily until British voters decided in a referendum on June 23 to leave the European Union. Although polls showed a close race throughout the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign, the result came as a shock \u2014 one that evidently wore off quickly, as stocks fell precipitously but then recovered nearly all of the Brexit losses in the final days of the month.The British vote overshadowed a far less surprising decision earlier in June by the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates. Explaining the Fed\u2019s thinking to a Senate committee, Janet L. Yellen, the central bank\u2019s chairwoman, highlighted \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about the economy.Whatever uncertainties investors faced, in whatever corner of the world, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended June at 2,098.86, up 1.9 percent for the quarter.The post-Brexit bounce \u2014 after the post-Brexit swoon \u2014 helped to produce a 2.5 percent return for domestic stock funds in the quarter, according to Morningstar. The average international stock fund rose 1.4 percent, but portfolios in Europe lost 3.4 percent.Even if the British referendum had gone the other way, American stocks might have been vulnerable to a decline, albeit not necessarily all at once, and after their rebound, they may be vulnerable to one again. The S.&P. 500 ended the quarter trading at 19 times the earnings that component companies reported in the previous four quarters, compared with a historical average of about 15.Not only are valuations high, but earnings growth is low and expectations are falling. Analysts estimated earnings of $118.79 for the 2016 S.&P. 500 at the end of June, according to FactSet Research, a figure that has declined in each of the last six quarters.The conundrum that investors face heading into the second half is that alternative destinations for their money aren\u2019t cheap, either. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for instance, declined in the second quarter to 1.4 percent from 1.78 percent. That helped the average long-term government bond fund gain 6.5 percent, and bond funds in general rose 2.6 percent.Some niches within the markets \u2014 stocks of companies in one industry or region, bonds from certain types of issuers \u2014 may offer adequate return prospects at acceptable risk, investment advisers say. But they warn that gains are likely to be meager at best in broad asset classes. Few options are good; some may be good enough.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find real pockets of value in the financial markets today,\u201d said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. \u201cI don\u2019t see much where you can say, \u2018Aha! This is a great opportunity.\u2019\u201dNeither does Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates. He blames the Fed and its peers for much of the situation.\u201cThe mainstream markets that most people rely on are generally pretty expensive, with anemic yields,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks deserve most of the credit for that, basically blowing bubbles all over the world.\u201dBut not everywhere.\u201cIf you look outside the mainstream markets, you see some bargains,\u201d Mr. Arnott said. \u201cThe lowest-hanging fruit is emerging-market stocks. They\u2019ve been in a brutal five-year bear market.\u201dIn contrast to American stocks, indexes of emerging markets are trading at less than 10 times earnings. Emerging-market bonds are similarly cheap, in his view, with yields at a greater premium to those on Treasury debt than at any time since 1998, during the Asian financial crisis and Russian debt default.\u201cWhen you see spreads this wide, it makes sense to put a large toe in the water,\u201d he said.Traders displayed no such circumspection when it came to British and Continental European stocks and currencies after the Brexit referendum. They took stock indexes down nearly 10 percent in just a few hours and sold the euro and especially the pound, which fell more than 10 percent, to its lowest level since 1985, and failed to recover with stocks.Comments from global banks after the referendum were mixed. Deutsche Bank called the result \u201ca sign of Europe\u2019s increasing fragility\u201d and warned that \u201cthis outcome points to greater risks.\u201d The S.&P. 500 could fall to 1,950, Deutsche said, and banks and companies with high European sales are particularly vulnerable.UBS Wealth Management advised staying the course, treacherous though it may be.\u201cGiven considerable uncertainties, we would encourage investors not to sell down risk assets in a time of heightened market volatility and lower-than-average liquidity,\u201d the bank said in a note to clients. \u201cWe are confident in the prospects for positive returns for U.S. equities.\u201dFocusing on the outlook for emerging markets, HSBC said there probably would not be much direct impact on business. The bank cautioned, however, that \u201cthe U.K.\u2019s referendum decision to leave the E.U. means we are entering an uncertain world and there will likely be pressure on emerging-market financial assets based on immediate risk aversion.\u201dJeremy Richardson, a manager of stock portfolios for RBC Global Asset Management, said that the world was plenty uncertain before June 23 rolled round.\u201cA big question that hangs over all of us is, How do we move on from this world of low, even negative, interest rates that we find ourselves in?\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks are running out of policy tools; that creates a level of uncertainty. Perhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why equity markets have not been more robust.\u201dMr. Richardson recommends avoiding long-term bonds or the stocks of companies that investors may view as proxies for them for their stable trading patterns. Their popularity has made them expensive, just like bonds, he warned.He prefers stocks of \u201cbusinesses that do things a little differently,\u201d including discount clothing retailers and the carmaker Tesla. He also likes companies involved in cloud computing and so-called big data, as well as immunotherapy, or the development of cancer treatments that enhance immune system responses to tumors.\u201cPeople spend so much time on what Janet Yellen is going to say next or the price of copper and tin\u201d instead of focusing on individual companies, Mr. Richardson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just talking about the market, you\u2019re missing a big part of the story.\u201dBut central banks remain a big part of the story, too. However the Fed and its peers might go about extricating themselves from nearly a decade of extraordinary monetary policy, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, wishes they would just get on with it.\u201cWe have uninterrupted growth with full employment,\u201d he said. It\u2019s no longer appropriate, he said, \u201cto employ crisislike policies when the crisis is long past in the U.S.\u201dThough he considers the economic backdrop benign, Mr. Paulsen acknowledges that valuations are quite high, so he envisions \u201cmidsingle-digit buy-and-hold returns\u201d and expects the S.&P. 500 to trade between 1,800 and 2,200 in the second half.He favors sectors like financial services, industrials and materials and would avoid consumer sectors, where prices have been bid up. Foreign markets may do better than the United States, in his view, because they are less further along in the upward slope of their economic cycles.Other niches that Mr. Paulsen would consider include market-neutral and other alternative funds, which try to achieve modest returns with minimal risk, and real estate and commodity funds, in case the Fed loses control and inflation begins to stir.Ms. Patterson at Bessemer cautioned that all manner of developments, from terrorism to slowing growth in China, could cause turmoil in the markets this year, and she reminded investors that the Brexit referendum wasn\u2019t the only vote that must be factored into asset prices. She expects some companies to hold off on hiring and investment decisions as the presidential election draws closer.\u201cEven with a benign outcome\u201d to the various sources of uncertainty, she said, \u201cgiven valuations and the outlook for profits, being neutral in equities makes sense.\u201dAmong the few assets she prefers in the present climate are high-quality corporate bonds and shares of global companies that tend to trade with less volatility than the overall market, as long as they are also reasonably priced.If such slim pickings and the prospect of slim returns leave investors feeling disappointed, Mr. Paulsen has a simple piece of advice: Get over it.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the world you live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much available anywhere.\u201d Trying to make the best of a mediocre situation, he added: \u201cThe best of this bull market is long past, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Makers of Self-Driving Cars Ask What to Do With Human Nature", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byWheelsThe question is relevant not only for cars of the future but also for ones already on the road.While the Tesla Model S has been getting all the attention in the last week, the fact is that many cars, including models from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, now have systems that use a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping and automatic braking to enable drivers to briefly take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road.Some Tesla drivers have reveled in making videos of themselves using the Autopilot feature. But the more conventional automakers have designed their systems to take control of the car for only a few seconds at a time; the driver must be ready to resume command at any time.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration classifies such vehicles and their limited automation as Level 2 cars. So what level should come next?In the safety agency\u2019s taxonomy, the next step would be Level 3, which describes vehicles that can drive on their own in specific circumstances, such as on the highway, but still require a human driver to be \u201cavailable for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time.\u201dBut the technology giant Google, as it continues working toward what the company hopes will one day be a commercially available autonomous vehicle, has concluded that meeting such a requirement is not possible and the only safe way to proceed is to take the driver out of the equation. Some conventional automakers are beginning to agree.Volvo, whose Level 2 cars include the 2017 S90, has decided to skip the Level 3 stage. Like Google, Volvo is pursuing Level 4 cars \u2014 fully autonomous vehicles that don\u2019t require any driver input aside from setting a destination.A car changing lanes at 50 miles per hour should not expect a driver to be able to suddenly take control, said Erik Coelingh, who leads Volvo\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research program, Drive Me. \u201cSome people can take control in 10 seconds, but if someone fell asleep it could take two minutes,\u201d he said.\u201cI was in a driving simulator a couple of weeks ago, and they asked me to play Dots on my phone\u201d while the virtual car was in control, Mr. Coelingh said. \u201cThen there was a voice asking me politely to take control, and I was like, \u2018Just give me a couple more seconds to beat the high score.\u2019\u201dExperiments conducted last year by Virginia Tech researchers and supported by the national safety administration found that it took drivers of Level 3 cars an average of 17 seconds to respond to takeover requests. In that period, a vehicle going 65 m.p.h. would have traveled 1,621 feet \u2014 more than five football fields.Despite such startling findings, some automakers and researchers say it is too soon to abandon human intervention as vehicles become more autonomous.\u201cI\u2019m hesitant to write off Level 3,\u201d said Shane McLaughlin, the director of the Center for Automated Vehicle Systems at Virginia Tech, who thinks additional technology may yet solve the human handoff problem. \u201cI feel like we can get the machine to give the person enough time to react,\u201d he said.The driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.Such solutions might involve video and infrared systems in the car that monitor the driver\u2019s attentiveness. So-called electronic horizon technologies might also give drivers more time to react by \u201cseeing\u201d farther down the road, with cars able to automatically communicate with one another.Those in favor of taking a step-by-step transition that includes Level 3 cars point to the serious challenges still facing developers of fully autonomous Level 4 vehicles.Gill Pratt, who was recruited to lead Toyota\u2019s five-year, $1 billion project in automotive artificial intelligence, gave a presentation in January highlighting the ways a completely autonomous vehicle would need to be able to handle unusual situations.A viable autonomous car would need to be able, he said, to avoid a mattress falling off a moving truck on a crowded highway, even if it had never encountered such a situation before.Audi also supports incremental advances, rather than trying to leap ahead to fully autonomous cars. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure the conditions are right to begin Level 3,\u201d said Brad Stertz, Audi\u2019s director of government affairs. \u201cThe key part is focusing on driver availability.\u201dMr. Stertz said that when Audi was ready to offer Level 3 features, its system would give drivers audible and visual warnings if they appeared not to be paying attention. The system, planned for an Audi A8 in model year 2018, would at first be able to drive itself only under specific circumstances, such as in stop-and-go traffic on the highway at 35 m.p.h. or slower.Mr. Stertz and Mr. McLaughlin, of Virginia Tech, both stressed the importance of industry standards for partly autonomous Level 3 vehicles.BMW\u2019s recent announcement that it was working with Intel and Mobileye to bring Level 3 and Level 4 cars to market seemed to acknowledge the idea that standards were needed. BMW said the result of the collaboration would be an open platform that could be used by other manufacturers.But industry standards do not yet exist. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected this summer to release new guidelines for testing self-driving vehicles on public roads. The question many now have is whether those recommendations will still include Level 3 vehicles and how the results may be affected by the agency\u2019s investigation of the Tesla Model S accident.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joshua Brown, Who Died in Self-Driving Accident, Tested Limits of His Tesla", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byCANTON, Ohio \u2014 Joshua Brown loved his all-electric Tesla Model S so much he nicknamed it Tessy.And he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving hands-free. In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45,000 miles on the car.\u201cI do drive it a LOT,\u201d he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen Tesla-themed videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion.They also tend to be people who like to live on technology\u2019s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown\u2019s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a 3-D printer to make model tanks and trucks.His Tesla, in other words, was simply one more extension of his technology-driven life. It took him on far-flung adventures from the gravel driveway of the pale-blue clapboard house where he lived alone in Canton, an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland.The driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.\u201cHe liked it mainly because it was an exceptional use of technology, and Josh was very much an innovator,\u201d said his friend Paul Snow, who recalled how excited Mr. Brown was about his Tesla during a recent road trip. \u201cHe enjoyed the fact that technology was available, that it was being used to, ironically, increase safety on the roads.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s most recent video was his most popular. Titled \u201cAutopilot Saves Model S,\u201d it shows Mr. Brown driving on an interstate highway from Cleveland to Canton. A white truck cuts in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle, and by his account, the Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature swerves the car to the right, avoiding a collision.After Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s founder, called attention to the video on Twitter, it went viral.Mr. Brown seemed to be elated.\u201cHe had said, \u2018For something to catch Elon Musk\u2019s eye, I can die and go to heaven now,\u2019\u201d said a neighbor, Krista Kitchen, choking up. \u201cHe was absolutely thrilled \u2013 and then a couple weeks later he died.\u201dMs. Kitchen said Mr. Brown, 40, had just left a family trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando. His relatives did not respond to requests for comment. At Mr. Brown\u2019s house, behind an expansive, well-trimmed lawn, a man who answered the door on Friday said the family did not wish to speak to reporters.Ms. Kitchen and others described how Mr. Brown would eagerly share his Tesla with friends, letting them take turns behind the wheel. And they described a man who was broadly generous with his time, who consistently helped friends in need, and who stayed in touch with his fellow veterans.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cHe was certainly an adventurer,\u201d Mr. Snow said. \u201cHe was a warrior that served proudly for his country; he was a patriot. He did many things that had never been done before.\u201dMr. Brown was particularly interested in testing the limits of the Autopilot function, documenting how the vehicle would react in blind spots, going around curves and other more challenging situations.\u201cThis section in here is going to be very, very difficult for the car to handle,\u201d he said in one video, posted in October, as his vehicle rounded a curve. \u201cWe\u2019re filming this just so you can see scenarios where the car does not do well.\u201dMark Vernon, a high school classmate who recalled tinkering with electronics in shop class together, said that his friend showed off the self-driving feature on a recent visit at Mr. Brown\u2019s home.\u201cHe knew the hill that it would give up on, because it couldn\u2019t see far enough,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cHe knew all the limitations that it would find and he really knew how it was supposed to work.\u201dMr. Brown attended the University of New Mexico, where he studied physics and computer science, but did not graduate, the school said. Instead, he joined the Navy, where he served for more than a decade and specialized in disarming explosives, according to his company\u2019s website.His service included a stint with the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team 6. Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said he had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree.\u201dTesla owners tend to share a love of technology, and an eagerness to embrace the unknown, the untested or the unproven. Photos posted on Mr. Brown\u2019s Facebook page show a love of the outdoors, where he rappelled down cliffs and jumped out of airplanes for fun.\u201cHe\u2019d probably fly an F-18 to test-drive it,\u201d she said, referring to the military fighter jet.Tesla enthusiasts often also share a loyalty to the company, much the way Apple has engendered true believers whom it relies on to back the introduction of new iPhones, Macs and other products.Richard Henry, 26, who bought a 2015 Model S about nine months ago, uses Autopilot to take him through about 40 miles of freeway driving on each leg of his commute between San Francisco and Mountain View.When he started using his car\u2019s Autopilot mode, it had a tendency to lose track of the highway lines and tell him to take control. But in the last few months it has improved more and more. Most days he turns it on and sits with his hands on his knees \u2014 ready to take the wheel, he pointed out.Learning about the technology and getting used to it has been \u201csuperfun,\u201d he said. That is a point that separates him from the many other drivers who tend to learn how to use a few necessary functions in their car and never bother with most others. \u201cI really like trying stuff like this out and understanding how the technology works,\u201d Mr. Henry said.Mr. Brown\u2019s enthusiasm for technology factored deeply into his work at Nexu, which specialized in setting up internet access in rural areas of the country where forests and mountains created special obstacles to entering the connected world.\u201cThe big companies wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d Ms. Staneski said, adding that Mr. Brown had become a mentor to her son. \u201cIt was too difficult, or they just wanted to charge you an extreme amount of money, whereas Josh felt that we deserved a chance that everybody else had.\u201dRachel Abrams reported from Canton, Ohio, and Annalyn Kurtz from New York.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk of Tesla Sticks to Mission Despite Setbacks", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors, sat in a glass-walled conference room here last week in the company\u2019s auto factory. Around him, workers and robots were building the $70,000 luxury vehicles that have redefined how people think about electric cars.And then there is his plan for the world\u2019s largest battery factory. The so-called Gigafactory, in Nevada, is to be unveiled this week.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be really crazy about the Gigafactory is not just that it\u2019s giant,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the world with tiny factories that move slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need big factories with high-velocity output.\u201dScale and speed are watchwords for Mr. Musk and his save-the-world view of business, which addresses some of the biggest pressure points in climate change. Mr. Musk wants to create an alternative to fossil fuels by popularizing solar power and by using batteries to store energy from the sun and wind to power homes, cars and businesses at any time of day and in any season.It was the first known fatality of someone operating Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system, a technology meant to prevent such disasters by controlling both steering and braking. Tesla acknowledges that neither the car nor Mr. Brown engaged the brakes, and it says that the Autopilot system failed to see the white trailer against a bright Florida sky.Critics say Tesla was premature in putting the collision-avoidance system on the market last October \u2014 technology that Mr. Musk hailed soon after as \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dAnd they say Tesla sent a dangerous message by calling it Autopilot, suggesting that the system could operate the car by itself, even though it requires drivers to stay completely engaged in case something goes wrong.\u201cTesla shouldn\u2019t make guinea pigs of its buyers,\u201d said Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.In essence, critics say, a company bent on speed needs to understand when to slow down. But Mr. Musk said a regret of his was not having introduced Autopilot even sooner.With a view of the Tesla factory floor, and searching an invisible horizon as he collected his thoughts, he said that Mr. Brown\u2019s death was \u201cvery sad.\u201d Still, the technology enhances safety, he insisted, and one death in what the company counts as 140 million miles driven using Autopilot does not undermine that idea.\u201cThe easy decision would be to, or easier, I suppose, from the standpoint of minimizing attacks and criticism, would be to delay it and try to wait for some point where it\u2019s theoretically better,\u201d Mr. Musk said of Autopilot. \u201cBut if you wait for any point past the point that it\u2019s better than the cars that exist, you\u2019re making a decision to kill people with statistics.\u201dOther automakers, some with their own versions of collision-avoidance technology, have been publicly silent about the Autopilot controversy, while privately muttering about Tesla.Some of it could be schadenfreude. Mr. Musk has made a point of ridiculing the mainstream auto industry as too slow to change. And there is no doubt that Tesla, by proving that electric cars can be cool, must-have consumer products that can travel 200 miles between charges, has put pressure on other automakers to step up their own electric-vehicle efforts.But many on Wall Street say it matters little whether Tesla changes the world if it also keeps losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Electric utility companies also view Mr. Musk warily, filing regulatory challenges to his bid to revolutionize the way energy is generated, transported, stored and paid for.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.Although many in the financial community dismiss the merger proposal as mainly a way for Mr. Musk to have Tesla shareholders protect his investment in SolarCity, environmentalists say the consolidation plan makes a lot of sense.Musk devotees say his great talent is taking green-energy ideas, which others have long discussed in theory, and turning them into realities.\u201cHe makes a reasonable bid to be the Henry Ford of this era,\u201d said Bill McKibben, the environmental activist and author. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to kick off the mass market for renewable energy.\u201dMr. Musk says there\u2019s no time to spare.\u201cIt\u2019s the most serious thing that humanity faces,\u201d he said of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest problem in the world.\u201d\u201cThe faster we can transition to low carbon, maybe, ultimately, to a negative carbon economy, the better.\u201dIn high-desert heat outside Reno, Nev., last week, J. B. Straubel looked out at a vast dirt patch, a construction site that had just broken ground.\u201cThis will be building batteries in 12 months,\u201d said Mr. Straubel, Tesla\u2019s chief technology officer and a co-founder of the company with Mr. Musk.Behind Mr. Straubel was another part of the factory, already built and partly up and running. The buildings here will eventually make up the $5 billion Gigafactory, covering 10 million square feet and projected to put out what the company says will be more lithium-ion batteries each year than were produced globally in all of 2013.Tesla is planning a grand opening on Friday of the Gigafactory, intended to be Mr. Musk\u2019s 21st-century answer to Henry Ford\u2019s sprawling River Rouge plant, which transformed the concept of mass production in the 1920s.Mr. Straubel said speed was of the essence in getting the factory up to full production. \u201cThere\u2019s a sheer business need for it. Compressing the schedule tends to make things cheaper.\u201dIt is a view he clearly shares with Mr. Musk.\u201cIf affordability improves,\u201d Mr. Musk said during the interview in Fremont, \u201cthen more people can buy an electric car, more people can buy solar, more people can buy stationary storage.\u2019\u2019To help make his electric cars less expensive, Mr. Musk is intent on picking up the pace at Tesla\u2019s car factory. It produces 2,000 cars a week, only about a third as many as a conventional automaker\u2019s factory might crank out.Ramping up production is crucial to the next stage of the master plan: building a lower-cost version of the Tesla car. The new Model 3, to be priced at $35,000 \u2014 half as much as the Model S \u2014 is expected to come out in late 2017, and Tesla says it already has 373,000 preorders.For all his talk of speed, Mr. Musk, a physicist by training, is painstakingly deliberate, pausing between sentences.His wit can be so dry and understated as to go undetected, as when he joked to an audience at last fall\u2019s Paris climate talks that greenhouse gas is the natural world\u2019s \u201cturd in the punch bowl.\u201d The remark drew few laughs.The Paris climate accord epitomizes the slow international political and bureaucratic pace involved in building a consensus on the environmental crisis and trying to respond to what scientists increasingly view as the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced.Mr. Musk has positioned Tesla as an agile responder that can help consumers save the planet while the policy makers are still drafting position papers. Still, he has had his share of government help.Along with benefits like government subsidies to consumers of solar panels and electric cars, Tesla received $465 million in loans in 2010 from the Department of Energy to work on fuel-saving vehicle technology. Those loans were repaid in 2013.And it is with heavy financial assistance from New York State that SolarCity is building a 1.2-million-square-foot factory in Buffalo. (Tesla points out that oil and gas companies benefit from far greater subsidies).Even if Tesla meets its goals, of course, Mr. Musk alone cannot reverse climate change. If Tesla winds up with a half-million of its cars on the road in the next three years, for example, that would be a scant fraction of the country\u2019s more than 260 million motor vehicles.\u201cWill these cars make a meaningful difference themselves? No,\u201d David Keith, an assistant professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said of Tesla. The greater influence, Mr. Keith said, is cultural.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time, possibly ever,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a green product, with significant environmental credentials, has been the thing that everybody wanted.\u201dJeff Nesbit, former head of legislative and public affairs at the National Science Foundation under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, said Tesla\u2019s value could also be measured by the pressure it places on other carmakers to match it.\u201cHe\u2019s driving everybody else,\u201d Mr. Nesbit said. \u201cThat\u2019s the power Musk has.\u201dUtilities, whatever their resentments, are paying attention, too.\u201cElon is truly the archetype of the disruptive entrepreneur,\u201d said Andrew Beebe, a former electric industry executive who is now a venture capital investor. \u201cUtilities and utility executives, because of the success on the vehicle side, are absolutely taking note.\u201dOne nagging question about the Tesla quest involves the company\u2019s reliance on lithium-ion batteries. The chemistry can be volatile, and several early Teslas caught fire before the company built a titanium shield under the vehicle to guard against fire or damage.Another question: Can the batteries, even at the Gigafactory\u2019s massive scale, be made cheap enough to persuade most consumers to kick their fossil-fuel habit?After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cHe\u2019s got to get a little lucky,\u201d said John B. Goodenough, who turns 94 on Monday, the physicist who helped pioneer the rechargeable lithium-ion battery at Oxford University in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cI do give him credit just for audacity.\u201dMr. Musk, born in Pretoria in 1971 to a father who was a electromechanical engineer and a mother who was a model, emigrated at age 17 to Canada. He later moved to the United States and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and economics.He made his first millions through Zip2, an internet mapping and search business he founded with his younger brother, Kimbal, in 1995, and sold to Compaq four years later. Mr. Musk\u2019s next company, an electronic payment business, evolved into PayPal, for which he reportedly received $165 million when eBay bought it in 2002.Tesla was still in its infancy when Mr. Musk put his money behind it in 2004. By then he had founded SpaceX, with the aim of developing reusable rockets to eventually send people to Mars.So far, despite some spectacular and fiery failures of its test rockets, SpaceX has launched satellites for commercial use and is the first private company to dock with, and provide supplies to, the International Space Station. It sent a payload to the space station last week on a rocket that then returned and made a safe landing in Florida. Under a NASA contract, SpaceX is to begin sending astronauts to the station in the next few years.SolarCity, for its part, sprang from a 2004 road trip to Burning Man, during which Mr. Musk and his cousin Lyndon Rive mused about solar power\u2019s potential for countering climate change.Mr. Musk says his ventures should eventually be judged on \u201cthe degree to which they have accelerated the advent of sustainable energy.\u201d If he speeds up adoption by five to 10 years, he said, that would be a good outcome.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t really care about business all that much,\u201d said Mr. Musk, whose net worth Forbes estimates to be $12.5 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my first motivation.\u201dYet Tesla exists in a business world, where many competitors and critics may be rooting for his failure. The Autopilot story, and the death of Joshua Brown, gave them a narrative with more than money at stake.\u201cThings are like especially intense right now,\u201d Mr. Musk acknowledged.Tesla began installing cameras, sensors and other hardware for Autopilot in 2014, adding the software a year later to make the system functional.The basic version of Autopilot includes collision warning systems and emergency braking. A fuller option package allows for assisted steering and adaptive cruise control. Activating it requires the driver\u2019s acknowledgment that the technology is new and is still in \u201cpublic beta phase\u201d testing. Each time drivers turn it on, it warns them to keep their hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over.Consumer Reports has been warning since October, when full-dress Autopilot was rolled out, that the system has flaws. This month the magazine called on Tesla to disable the technology.\u201cAutopilot gives you the idea that it is more capable than it is, and once people view it as autonomous, they disengage and divert their eyes from the road,\u201d Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing, said in an interview.He and other safety experts also note that Autopilot continues operating even if drivers do not touch the steering wheel for several minutes.Mr. Fisher said that he had driven Teslas hands-free for more than three minutes, and that even when Autopilot warned him that he had gone too long without touching the steering wheel, the car continued driving for 30 seconds before the feature shut itself down.In a video in early April, Mr. Brown narrated as Autopilot swerved to miss a truck on a highway that had cut in front of him. After Mr. Musk publicized that video with a Twitter post on April 17, it spread quickly online.A little over three weeks later, Mr. Brown had the fatal collision that Autopilot failed to avoid.All of this has provided fuel for Tesla\u2019s critics. But Mr. Musk said the detractors were overreacting and ignoring Autopilot\u2019s lifesaving benefits.And so for Tesla, it is full throttle forward. Waiting to deploy Autopilot, he said, would have been worse than merely going slow.\u201cTo make that decision simply in order to avoid criticism,\u201d Mr. Musk said, \u201cthat\u2019s a terrible act of cowardice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of preorders Tesla has for the Model 3. It is 373,000, not 315,000.Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit, Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich., and Diane Cardwell from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fatality Forces Tesla to Confront Its Limits", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 As the co-founder and chief executive of Tesla Motors, the technology billionaire Elon Musk has consistently portrayed his company\u2019s electric cars as cleaner, safer and more innovative than models made by other automakers.His confidence in Tesla\u2019s technology has seemed boundless, particularly when the company announced last year that it would equip its flagship Model S sedans with a self-driving feature called Autopilot that was still in its testing phase. The technology was so out in front of federal highway regulations that there were no rules against it.But with the revelation this week that a Model S driver in Florida was killed in May while operating his car in self-driving mode, Mr. Musk\u2019s determination to push limits has hit its most formidable roadblock.The question now is how much longer Mr. Musk and Tesla can continue to defy auto industry convention in trying to stay so far ahead of the competition. A major point of contention is the Autopilot feature and the decision to make it available to car owners while it was in \u201cbeta test\u201d mode \u2014 a term typically applied to software that a company releases on an experimental basis.\u201cI can\u2019t think of another example of anything like this delivered in a beta phase in the automotive world,\u201d said Ron Montoya, an analyst with the auto research firm Edmunds.com. \u201cEverything is tested up and down before it comes out.\u201dEven some Tesla owners, many of whom can be cultishly devoted to the brand, now question whether the self-driving technology is as safe as advertised.\u201cIt gives you a false sense of security,\u201d said Pete Cordaro, a Model S owner who used Autopilot in a loaner when his Tesla vehicle was being repaired. \u201cYou get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel, but you really can\u2019t.\u201dThe death in May of Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was the first known fatality in a vehicle being operated by computer systems.Auto industry executives and analysts wondered aloud on Friday whether Tesla had miscalculated by introducing a self-driving feature that was perhaps not ready to live up to Mr. Musk\u2019s pronouncements. In April, he told a conference in Norway, \u201cThe probability of having an accident is 50 percent lower if you have Autopilot on.\u201dThe driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.Tesla declined to comment on Friday, but critics were not so reticent.\u201cThey\u2019ve always had this attitude of invincibility, and perhaps promising more than their cars can deliver,\u201d said Joseph Phillippi, president of the consulting firm AutoTrends. \u201cBut what can they say about a self-driving car that drove straight into a tractor-trailer?\u201dAfter minor recalls on Tesla cars this year, the company\u2019s quality controls were already being called into question, as was Mr. Musk\u2019s ability to adequately oversee Tesla while pursuing other grand plans that include a proposal two weeks ago to merge the company with his solar energy company, SolarCity.Other automakers and technology companies at work on self-driving vehicles that are years away from the commercial market expressed concerns that the Florida death could cast a pall over their field \u2014 and prompt federal regulators to rush to write restrictive rules on the technology before any of their cars take to the road. Executives at the rival companies declined to comment publicly.But Mr. Phillippi, of AutoTrends, noted that most car companies had already tempered expectations and predicted a conservative timetable for the availability of self-driving vehicles.\u201cYou talk to the traditional automakers, and they say we are five years away from being able to let go of the wheel and the car will drive itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be time for Mr. Musk to back off, too.\u201dWith a federal investigation underway, Tesla has declined to respond to many questions about the Florida crash, including why it did not make details of the accident public for nearly two months \u2014 and then not until regulators announced their inquiry.In addition, Tesla did not respond to emails on Friday about when the company would disclose more information about the accident, or about any plans for possibly alerting vehicle owners about the dangers of misusing the Autopilot feature.A spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Bryan Thomas, declined to say why the agency waited until late June to begin a formal inquiry into an accident that happened in May, or why the agency did not require Tesla to notify owners about a possible problem.While the investigation into the accident is just beginning, the repercussions could be profound for Tesla.The company has been preparing to sharply increase its manufacturing production for the introduction next year of its less expensive Model 3 sedan, which already has a long waiting list of customers who have preordered the vehicles. At the same time, Mr. Musk is trying to engineer the merger between Tesla and SolarCity and complete a new factory under construction in Nevada that will produce batteries meant to provide energy storage both for cars and households.In the past, Mr. Musk has been able to move quickly past issues related to Tesla\u2019s quality and safety, such as when the company modified its cars to prevent batteries from catching fire in high-speed collisions.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.But the company has been vague about whether the Florida accident was the result of a defect in the self-driving system, or the result of a driver who neglected to use it correctly.For now, Tesla continues to characterize the system as a safety improvement.\u201cWhen used in conjunction with driver oversight, the data is unequivocal that Autopilot reduces driver workload and results in a statistically significant improvement in safety when compared to purely manual driving,\u201d the company said in a news release discussing the Florida crash.That type of response is not unusual for Mr. Musk, who tends to attack suggestions that Tesla has ever fallen short of its goals.\u201cThis company is very personal to Elon Musk and he is very passionate and protective of it,\u201d said Mr. Montoya of Edmunds.com. \u201cBut when anything goes wrong, he becomes very defensive.\u201dRegulators are now proceeding with the next step in their investigation by preparing to make an official \u201cinformation request\u201d for Tesla to provide more details on the accident and the self-driving equipment in the vehicle.Mr. Thomas, the spokesman for the federal safety agency, declined to say how long the process might take.Mr. Musk has recently been publicly drumming up support for Tesla\u2019s proposed merger with SolarCity, while continuing his role as Tesla\u2019s chief cheerleader.On May 31, for example, he spent more than three hours dissecting Tesla\u2019s history and outlining its future before an overflow crowd of shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting.Over the course of the meeting, he talked extensively about setting new industry standards for manufacturing at Tesla\u2019s California plant, and building the world\u2019s biggest battery factory in the Nevada desert.When asked by one Tesla owner about whether he expected to keep adding new technology to the Model S, Mr. Musk responded as if that was a foregone conclusion. \u201cWe are always going to keep improving the product,\u201d he said.But what he did not mention at all was the Florida accident, which had occurred three weeks earlier.Neal E.

{"Headline": "Fatal Tesla Crash Draws In Transportation Safety Board", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byThe National Transportation Safety Board, which more typically looks into accidents involving trains, planes, buses and ships, confirmed on Sunday that it had sent a team to investigate the crash, which killed Joshua Brown, an entrepreneur from Ohio.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Florida Highway Patrol are already investigating the accident. The traffic safety agency, the nation\u2019s main auto safety regulator, is trying to determine whether the car\u2019s Autopilot system was at fault.Mr. Brown, 40, was driving his 2015 Tesla Model S in Williston, Fla., when it hit a truck that had turned left and was crossing in front of the car. Tesla, whose vehicles have the ability to send the company data about their operating conditions, has said that the Autopilot was engaged at the time, and that neither Mr. Brown nor the system activated the brakes before impact.The involvement of the transportation safety board signals even greater scrutiny of the accident and Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology. The agency specializes in determining the causes of crashes and is familiar with the self-driving technology used in trains and airplanes.\u201cI think it\u2019s very appropriate that N.T.S.B. is doing this, and I welcome it,\u201d said Joan Claybrook, a former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator who continues to advocate improved auto safety. \u201cI think there\u2019s an urgency to find out if these autonomous systems are at fault because companies continue to push hard to get the technology onto the road.\u201dTesla cars equipped with Autopilot can use a camera and radar to steer themselves for short periods of time, and can detect other moving vehicles and slow or even stop in traffic under certain conditions. But drivers are warned when they turn it on to keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert.The National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have some overlap in their responsibilities, but the safety board is primarily an investigative agency that determines the causes of accidents.

{"Headline": "As U.S. Investigates Fatal Tesla Crash, Company Defends Autopilot System", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEven as federal safety officials step up their investigation of the fatal crash of a driver operating a Tesla car with its Autopilot system engaged, the company continues to defend the self-driving technology as safe when properly used.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday released a detailed set of questions for the carmaker about its automated driving system, particularly the emergency braking function.The Autopilot system has been the subject of a federal investigation since regulators revealed in late June that the driver of a Tesla Model S sedan, Joshua Brown, was killed on May 7 when his vehicle crashed into a tractor-trailer in Florida.The Autopilot feature was engaged at the time, Tesla has said, but neither the automatic braking system nor Mr. Brown applied the brakes before the car hit the trailer at 65 miles an hour.Despite that acknowledgment by the company, as the federal agency pushes for answers about the accident and whether the Autopilot system failed to work properly, Tesla officials continue to say that the technology is safe. They also say they have no plans to disable the feature, which is installed in about 70,000 Tesla cars on the road. Instead, they indicate that drivers may be to blame for misusing Autopilot.In an interview, a Tesla executive said the company believed that the system was safe as designed, but that consumers needed to realize that misusing Autopilot \u201ccould mean the difference between life and death.\u201dThe executive, whom Tesla authorized to speak only if he was not named, said drivers needed to be aware of road conditions and be able to take control of the car at a moment\u2019s notice \u2014 even though he said Autopilot\u2019s self-steering and speed controls could operate for up to three minutes without any driver involvement.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has sent a letter to Tesla indicating the agency is investigating whether there are defects in the automaker's Autopilot system.\u201cWith any driver assistance system, a lack of customer education is a very real risk,\u201d the executive said.Tesla has been widely criticized for introducing Autopilot in \u201cbeta\u201d mode, which usually signifies a technology that is still under development and not completely tested. And some engineers researching self-driving cars have concluded that automated systems that rely on the driver\u2019s suddenly resuming command cannot be made fully safe.But the Tesla executive said the Autopilot system had performed safely during tens of millions of miles of driving by consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we are starting to test this using our customers as guinea pigs,\u201d he said.Those systems include automatic emergency braking, which is supposed to stop Tesla models from running into other vehicles detected by radar and a camera. Another is Autosteer, which uses radar and cameras to guide the vehicles on highways or in slow-moving traffic.The attention generated by the fatal Tesla accident has stoked a public debate about the safety and wisdom of making \u201cself-driving cars.\u201d But in reality \u2014 YouTube videos of daredevil Tesla drivers notwithstanding \u2014 the current generation of technology involves driver-assistance features mainly meant to make vehicles safer and help avoid accidents.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.In the future, fully self-driving cars have a huge potential to save lives, but the current driver-assist cars can present major risks, said David Teater, a prominent traffic safety advocate. The problem, Mr. Teater said, is that the technology sends a mixed message to drivers, suggesting they can disengage but also requiring them to take over at a moment\u2019s notice.It is not an issue unique to Tesla, but one that potentially pertains to any carmaker that is \u2018\u2018betting the farm on driver-assist technology that requires the driver to remain engaged,\u201d he said.\u201cWould you want your kid jumping into a Tesla and turning on driving assist after what\u2019s just happened?\u201d Mr. Teater asked. Right now the technology, he said, \u201cis more about marketing than safety.\u201dJeff Larason, the Massachusetts highway safety director, is among those in the auto safety community who argue that automated and self-driving technologies will ultimately greatly reduce the toll from driving. Human error accounts for more than 90 percent of all car crashes, he said.Mr. Larason said the Tesla fatality, while a \u201chorrible tragedy,\u201d should not undermine the good that accident-avoidance technology might achieve.\u201cWhen it happened,\u201d he said, referring to Florida fatality, \u201cmy response was, \u2018Here comes the I-told-you-so, knee-jerk reaction.\u2019\u201dIf autonomous driving technology hits a roadblock, he said, \u201cit won\u2019t be because of technology, but because of legislation and because the public doesn\u2019t have the will to make it happen.\u201dWhile the systems enable drivers to briefly take their hands off the wheel, they are mainly designed to help drivers avoid accidents.But the issues raised by the Tesla fatality, and the questions that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking, involve whether Autopilot\u2019s potential safety advantages offset the risks that such technology lulls drivers into a false sense of security.Tesla remotely collects vast volumes of information about its cars as they are being driven. The federal safety agency apparently wants the company to thoroughly mine that data.The agency\u2019s letter asks Tesla to provide a wide range of information, including a list of all vehicles sold in the United States that are equipped with the Autopilot system. It also asks how many miles have been driven with Autosteer activated, and how many times the automatic system warned drivers to put their hands back on the steering wheel.The N.H.T.S.A. also wants to know, among other things, the number of incidents in which Tesla vehicles\u2019 automatic emergency braking was activated. The letter asks Tesla to turn over any information on consumer complaints or reports of crashes, or other incidents in which a vehicle\u2019s accident-prevention systems may not have worked properly.The agency is also seeking detailed data about how Tesla\u2019s technology detects pedestrians, bicycles and other vehicles, including vehicles moving laterally across a road.The tractor-trailer involved in the Florida crash made a left turn across the path of Mr. Brown\u2019s Tesla, which the accident investigation report indicated did not slow before hitting the trailer and then continuing under it at high speed before eventually running off the road and striking a utility pole that brought the car to a stop.Tesla has said that in Mr. Brown\u2019s accident, the Autopilot system failed to see the white truck against a bright sky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla and Google Take Different Roads to Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Silicon Valley, where companies big and small are at work on self-driving cars, there have been a variety of approaches, and even some false starts.The most divergent paths may be the ones taken by Tesla, which is already selling cars that have some rudimentary self-driving functions, and Google, which is still very much in experimental mode.Google\u2019s initial efforts in 2010 focused on cars that would drive themselves, but with a person behind the wheel to take over at the first sign of trouble and a second technician monitoring the navigational computer.But Google decided to play down the vigilant-human approach after an experiment in 2013, when the company let some of its employees sit behind the wheel of the self-driving cars on their daily commutes.Engineers using onboard video cameras to remotely monitor the results were alarmed by what they observed \u2014 a range of distracted-driving behavior that included falling asleep.\u201cWe saw stuff that made us a little nervous,\u201d Christopher Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon University roboticist who directs the car project at Google, said at the time.The experiment convinced the engineers that it might not be possible to have a human driver quickly snap back to \u201csituational awareness,\u201d the reflexive response required for a person to handle a split-second crisis.So Google engineers chose another route, taking the human driver completely out of the loop. They created a fleet of cars without brake pedals, accelerators or steering wheels, and designed to travel no faster than 25 miles an hour.For good measure they added a heavy layer of foam to the front of their cars and a plastic windshield, should the car make a mistake. While not suitable for high-speed interstate road trips, such cars might one day be able to function as, say, robotic taxis in stop-and-go urban settings.At the soonest, Google says it hopes to put such vehicles on the market by 2019.\u201cSafety has been paramount for the Google self-driving car team from the very beginning,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, the artificial intelligence researcher who created the Google project. \u201cWe wanted it to be significantly safer to the point where there would be no accidents ever.\u201dSo far Google\u2019s robotic cars have largely succeeded, with just one slow-speed fender bender caused by the robotic driver.Still, no engineering consensus exists about the best path to vehicle autonomy. In and around Silicon Valley, at least 19 commercial self-driving efforts are underway, ranging from big carmakers like Nissan and Ford and technology giants like Google, Baidu and Apple, to shoestring operations like comma.ai.Significantly, Toyota, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, has not joined the rush to self-driving. It has established a research laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., that does not aim to make a car that drives itself, but instead a \u201cguardian angel\u201d \u2014 a computerized system that would take over only when the human driver made an error.Automotive engineers at work on autonomous vehicles refer to a design challenge they call \u201covertrust,\u201d the possibility that humans may not fully understand the limitations of the self-driving safety features they rely on.Tesla notes that Autopilot is meant only to assist drivers, not to replace them. And its onscreen warnings and owner\u2019s manual emphasize that drivers should remain vigilant and keep their hands on or near the wheel at all times.But in tempting its customers with a feature still so experimental that the company refers to it as a \u201cbeta\u201d test, Tesla has sped far ahead of the rest of the industry and in the public\u2019s perception of the state of self-driving technology.Like Mr. Brown, the company\u2019s customers tend to be technically knowledgeable and adventuresome types, who are not necessarily willing to wait for the go-slow approach taken by the rest of the industry. That includes one of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known engineers.\u201cBeta products shouldn\u2019t have such life-and-death consequences,\u201d said Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, who owns a Tesla Model S.Mr. Wozniak concedes he worries that the Autopilot feature might lead him to take his eyes off the road at the wrong moment. But that is a risk he is willing to run.\u201cEven though I might have a slight attention lapse at the exact wrong moment,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s easier to drive this way and not feel as tired.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Faults Brakes, but Not Autopilot, in Fatal Crash", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byTesla Motors has told Senate investigators that its crash-prevention system failed to work properly in a fatal crash, but said its Autopilot technology was not at fault, according to a Senate staff member.Instead, Tesla told members of the Senate Commerce Committee staff on Thursday that the problem involved the car\u2019s automatic braking system, said the staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.It was not clear how or why Tesla considers the automatic braking system to be separate from Autopilot, which combines automated steering, adaptive cruise control and other features meant to avoid accidents. Tesla declined to comment on Friday.\u201cThose systems are supposed to work together to prevent an accident,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm. \u201cBut either the car didn\u2019t know it had to stop, or it did know and wasn\u2019t able to stop. That involves Autopilot and the automatic braking.\u201dThe company told the committee staff that it considered the braking systems as \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from Autopilot, which manages the car\u2019s steering, and can change lanes and adjust travel speed, the staff member said.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The meeting on Thursday, which involved Tesla engineering executives, was in response to a request from the committee for more information about Autopilot and the cause of the crash in Florida.The executives also urged against governmental action that could slow introduction of automated-driving technology, according to the staff member. Tesla expressed the view that while some deaths might occur as automakers developed and perfected these kinds of innovations, the safety benefits outweighed the risks, this person said.Tesla is still trying to determine whether the car\u2019s radar and camera systems failed to detect a tractor-trailer that was crossing the roadway, or whether they saw the truck but misidentified it as an overpass or overhead road sign.The information presented at the meeting is the most extensive explanation Tesla has given so far for what role its Autopilot system might have played in the crash, which took the life of Joshua Brown, 40, an entrepreneur from Ohio.Mr. Brown was traveling on a divided highway in Williston, Fla., with Autopilot controlling his Tesla Model S when it crashed into a tractor-trailer rig that had made a left turn in front of the car.The company has previously said that neither the car\u2019s Autopilot system nor Mr. Brown activated the brakes before the impact and noted that the radar and camera systems might have failed to detect the white truck against a bright sky.The reliability of Autopilot is a sensitive matter for Tesla because the company tries to present itself to customers and investors as a technology company rather than an automaker, said Mr. Brauer, the Kelley Blue Book analyst.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.\u201cAutopilot is a key component of the image Tesla wants to project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a big deal about it. So they don\u2019t want to be in the position of saying that there\u2019s something wrong with something that\u2019s part of the whole company\u2019s image.\u201dTesla was also due on Friday to provide the first batch of information requested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is investigating whether a safety defect exists in Autopilot or other safety systems. Tesla declined to say whether it would meet the Friday deadline.The National Transportation Safety Board, which typically examines airplane and train accidents, is also investigating. It has found the car was traveling at 74 miles per hour, nine more than the speed limit.Tesla is scheduled to report its second-quarter financial results on Wednesday. Analysts expect a loss, as the company spends heavily to increase production of a new Model X sport utility vehicle, finish the development of a more affordable Model 3 compact and start production at the gigantic battery factory that it is opening in Nevada.It is unclear whether the fatal crash and questions about the Autopilot technology are hurting Tesla\u2019s sales or reputation. It delivered 14,370 cars in the second quarter, fewer than expected, because 5,150 cars were still in transit to customers, the company said. A year ago, it delivered 11,507 cars in the second quarter.A repercussion of the Florida crash is that Mobileye, the Israeli provider of image-processing technology used in Autopilot, is no longer supplying Tesla because of disagreements over how the system is being used.Consumer Reports magazine also publicly called on Tesla to disable the Autopilot\u2019s automatic steering function until it can find a way to make sure drivers keep their hands on the steering wheel while using it.Autopilot consists of a series of safety components that can steer, brake, overtake other vehicles and maintain lane position automatically with little input from the driver. The system warns drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert. But many drivers, Mr. Brown included, have posted videos on YouTube showing it is possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel.Advertisement"}

We received more than 2,500 emails.All over California, communities are grappling with a shortage of affordable housing.Is Airbnb part of the problem?The company is increasingly at odds with local governments in the state.Airbnb has resisted, accusing officials of overreaching.Now, Airbnb is in a legal battle with its hometown, San Francisco, which has brought up wrenching questions about inequality, neighborhood change and the free market.Founded inside a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a major local success story.But Airbnb has also become a focal point for anger at the tech industry \u2014 even more so than the Google buses that bring workers to jobs in Silicon Valley.Short-term rentals in San Francisco are being blamed, at least in part, for rising rents that are driving out longtime residents.Last year, Airbnb spent more than $8 million to defeat a ballot measure that would have limited rentals to no more than 75 nights a year.Last month, San Francisco supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that would fine Airbnb $1,000 per day for each host listed on its website who is not registered with the city.\u201cThis legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb,\u201d the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s this very visible sign of the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just of gentrification, but of how wide the disparity is between people who have opportunities and people who don\u2019t.\u201dWhen questioned by reporters about the state budget, which he signed this week, Governor Brown responded with a parable, Aesop\u2019s \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper.\u201dAesop, an ancient Greek fabulist, \u201chas some credibility,\u201d Mr. Brown said.That was one of the governor\u2019s less obscure literary references.Since returning to Sacramento in 2011 for a second stint as governor, he has quoted poets, religious scholars and biologists.He invoked the book of Genesis, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a king of Spain and \u201cThe Little Engine That Could\u201d all in the same 2013 speech.\u201cOver the mountain the little engine went \u2014 we are going to get over that mountain,\u201d he said, making an analogy to California\u2019s high-speed rail plan after quoting the children\u2019s book.The unusual source material has perplexed some analysts.But his literary breadth may also help reinforce his image as a wise, old \u2014 well, experienced (he\u2019s 78) \u2014 politician, who will keep his party\u2019s impulses to spend in check.During a speech last year about climate change, Mr. Brown said proudly that he was among the last politicians with a classics degree.\u201cIt does come in handy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause some of the same mistakes have been made over and over again.\u201dCalifornia Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.Advertisement"}

I, for one, admire her initiative in helping more women get elected to Parliament and her reputation as a tough negotiator.However, her decision to appoint Boris Johnson, a staunch proponent of Brexit, as foreign minister has made me quite skeptical. The man is a strictly undiplomatic diplomat and has inevitably been compared to Trump (look him up, the resemblance is uncanny), but perhaps May has some underlying logic to this.A former colleague once described her as a \u201cbloody difficult woman,\u201d and I hope that is what Britain needs in this time of May-hem.Runners-UpHonorable MentionsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley of Space Start-Ups? It Could Be Seattle", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside an office in this city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby.There\u2019s more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle\u2019s abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.\u201cThe reason for it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don\u2019t seem to want to move to L.A.\u201d\u201cAbandoned in Place,\u201d a new book of photographs by Roland Miller, finds haunting beauty in derelict launch pads, rusting towers and other detritus of the American space race.One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun\u2019s energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won\u2019t say how much they\u2019ve invested.\u201cMany of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,\u201d said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s director of marketing and business development.Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in which Boeing is based. It is Chicago, not Seattle. (Though the company moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001, about half of its workforce is still in Seattle.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lessons From the Tesla Crash", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byEditorialTesla\u2019s electric cars are not self-driving, but when the Autopilot system is engaged it can keep the car in a lane, adjust its speed to keep up with traffic and brake to avoid collisions. Tesla says audio and visual alerts warn drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and watch the road. If a driver is unresponsive to the alerts, the car is programmed to slow itself to a stop.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should study how automakers can minimize driver distraction. This will become more urgent as advanced systems become available in cars made for the mass market.The agency does not yet have regulations for driverless cars or cars that have driver assistance systems. But when officials do put rules in place, they will have to update them regularly as they learn about how the technology works in practice. Automation should save lives.

{"Headline": "The Tesla Experiment: Drive, It Said", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byLettersDefenders and skeptics discuss an Autopilot system that recently led to a fatality.That said, the effort to develop an autonomous self-driving car is a worthy exercise. Adaptive cruise control, lane change warnings and automatic braking triggered by obstruction sensors are just a few of the features that will make driving safer even if we never reach the driverless end state. As Tesla, Google, Volvo and the others work to take the human element (and all of its inherent weaknesses \u2014 distractions, slow reflexes, declining vision and hearing) out of the driving equation, accidents will no doubt be reduced, and many, such as rear-end collisions, may be eliminated.ROBERT CHECCHIODunellen, N.J.I live in the Boston area, where driving is chaotic, unruly and often bewilderingly rude \u2014 but at least there is a person behind the wheel who can correct such excesses quickly. If self-driving vehicles can\u2019t read the nuances of snow, flooded roads or other weather conditions, just one of the problems your article mentions, that alone makes them dangerous. Several thousand pounds of metal piloted by technology incapable of adjusting for nuance or unusual situations seems like a recipe for avoidable disasters. SALLY PEABODYMedford, Mass.To the Editor: In the wake of the Tesla Autopilot fatality and continuing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation, Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle make the important, if perhaps self-evident, point that self-driving cars must be certified safe before public use. The real question for policy makers, however, is what constitutes an appropriately \u201csafe\u201d autonomous vehicle. Our current transportation system exacts a terrible toll: More than 35,000 people died on American roads in 2015, an almost 8 percent increase over 2014, and the system is almost completely dependent on petroleum, constraining American foreign policy and exposing our servicemen and women to conflict.Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce traffic fatalities, expand mobility access to millions, and enhance national and economic security by building a fuel-diverse transportation system. These benefits compel the deployment of autonomous vehicles once their safety matches today\u2019s cars with all their flaws. Imposing excessive regulation and barriers to deployment runs contrary to the national interest.ROBBIE DIAMOND and AMITAI Y. BIN-NUNWashingtonAs a psychiatrist who appreciates how sophisticated the brain is, I would argue that safe driving is no doubt enhanced by some technology. However, we risk losing ourselves \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 in becoming overly reliant on technology. Energy, time and money would be better spent teaching youths the dangers of using technology while driving rather than chasing a grandiose dream.LARRY S. SANDBERGNew YorkTo the Editor: The core of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot problem is no different from what we have been facing in cockpit automation. When something nonroutine and unthinkable happens, it is up to the human operator to intervene, take over and save the day. Of course this could be a challenge as he or she has been out of the loop, removed from active, hands-on control of the system, and can also be suffering from lack of situational awareness and skill atrophy. Air France and Asiana crashes in 2009 and 2013, respectively, are sober reminders of the perils of automation. It was Chesley B. Sullenberger\u2019s intervention and improvisation that safely landed a crippled US Airways plane in the Hudson River in 2009, saving the lives of 155 people.Tesla\u2019s not making \u201cdetails of the accident public for nearly two months \u2014 and then not until regulators announced their inquiries\u201d \u2014 possibly for public relations reasons, is unconscionable. Tesla, its enthusiastic \u201cbrand evangelist\u201d drivers and its boss, Elon Musk, should note what the Nobel physicist Richard P. Feynman said in the context of another technological system failure, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986: \u201cFor a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.\u201dNAJMEDIN MESHKATILos AngelesThe writer, a professor of engineering and aviation safety at the University of Southern California, was involved in studies of a G.M. concept car in the mid-1990s.If you are contemplating a self-driving car, be very, very careful. It will take many more years before it is really reliable in all real-life situations. It\u2019s cool technology, for sure, but it might kill you, as it did my friend. My heart aches for him.IVAR WOLDMoultonborough, N.H.The federal safety standard mandating this vehicle-to-vehicle communications system has been developed. It\u2019s just been stuck for months in the bureaucratic review process. Meanwhile, there are efforts underway at the Federal Communications Commission that would at best delay (and at worst, completely derail) the deployment of the lifesaving technologies. Powerful interests want to seize this safety spectrum currently allocated for intelligent transportation systems. The government should put safety first. Get the safety standard out, and then look at ways to share spectrum that don\u2019t interfere with lifesaving technology.JOHN BOZZELLAPresident and Chief Executive, Association of Global AutomakersWashingtonTo the Editor: Tesla gets put under the magnifying glass for a single event, while the same technology has prevented numerous accidents. Some of them have been documented by Tesla owners\u2019 dashboard cameras.While Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system can be operated hands-free, it does require the driver to grasp the steering wheel every few minutes to ensure that the driver is still engaged. Drivers must be ready to take over at a moment\u2019s notice. It is no longer possible to leave the driver\u2019s seat while Autopilot is in use.No safety technology is 100 percent effective. But given that Tesla\u2019s vehicle fleet has logged over 130 million miles with Autopilot turned on, the statistics look promising, even with one tragic fatality. The biggest risk lies in overconfidence on the part of some Tesla drivers \u2014 the assumption that Autopilot will save them from any situation. While it\u2019s cool to think of Autopilot as \u201cautonomous,\u201d it is really just a driver\u2019s aid. A pilot is still required.TODD R.

{"Headline": "Video Review: The New Audi Q7 Drops to Fighting Weight", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byDrivenWHETHER it\u2019s for a coming high school reunion or making those favorite jeans tolerable again, nearly all of us wouldn\u2019t mind dropping some weight. The same goes for cars. Lighter vehicles are quicker, and they chug less fuel.The first-generation Audi Q7 luxury sport utility vehicle was more than just a prime candidate for \u201cThe Biggest Loser.\u201d After its debut in 2006, it became the party guest that ate too much and overstayed its welcome. By the 2016 model year, Audi didn\u2019t even bother. It sold 2015 models until recently.Now comes the second-generation 2017 Q7, which apparently discovered the Paleo diet, shedding some 440 pounds in its North American version, even while adding equipment. That\u2019s equivalent to the weight of a family of four that travels in it. O.K., a trim family.Now weighing about 4,900 pounds, the new Q7 \u2014 along with the BMW X5 \u2014 is a middleweight, leaving the heavyweight class to the Cadillac Escalade (5,700 pounds) and Mercedes-Benz GLS (5,400 pounds). The bantamweight division is represented by the Volvo XC90 at 4,400 pounds.But lighter doesn\u2019t mean flimsier. The Q7 has never felt so solid, powered by a 3-liter supercharged V6 engine with 333 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque when slurping premium fuel. \u201cOffroad\u201d mode raises ground clearance nearly two and a half inches. An 8-speed transmission seamlessly chooses the right gear, though I\u2019m not crazy about the less-than-intuitive electronic shift controller.The Environmental Protection Agency rates the 2017 model at 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway. On average, that\u2019s an improvement of three miles per gallon over the 2015 model. The plug-in hybrid version that Europe gets isn\u2019t available in the United States. Nor is the diesel, which might be no surprise, considering the problems that Audi\u2019s parent, Volkswagen, is having with the United States government over software intended to cheat on diesel emissions.The Q7 accelerates swiftly, from zero to 60 in 5.7 seconds, according to Audi. But drivers should pay attention: It\u2019s quiet enough to lull them way past the speed limit. The ride quality is that elusive blend of comfortable and firm. With commendably little body roll or dive for an S.U.V., no one will get seasick.Prices begin at $55,750 with standard Quattro all-wheel drive, auto-braking with pedestrian detection and a panoramic glass roof. Optioned at $68,925, the tested Premium Plus model is stuffed with technology.At slower speeds on open roads, a feature called Congestion Assist steers, accelerates and brakes by itself. Drivers can remove their hands from the wheel for short distances and retrieve that dropped sippy cup, but caution is strongly advised.Unlike Tesla, whose similar system can operate at the posted speed limit \u2014 and even five miles an hour over it \u2014 Audi has designed Congestion Assist to work only below 40 m.p.h. (Volvo\u2019s similar technology operates only at speeds below 30 m.p.h.)At intersections, the Q7 will not allow the driver to make a left turn if sensors detect an oncoming car. The adaptive cruise control works with GPS information to adjust the Q7\u2019s velocity in speed zones and on tight corners.Known for its well-crafted cabins, Audi kicks it up a notch in the big Q, with high-quality materials that beat even the well-regarded Volvo XC90. The \u201cvirtual cockpit\u201d (basically a gauge cluster that can be configured) and retractable LCD screen are razor sharp.Audi is always tweaking its multimedia interface, and here it adds a useful touch pad with handwriting recognition, so letters and numbers can be written to enter data for search and navigation.Connected by 4G LTE, the Q7 can serve as a Wi-Fi hot spot or send automatic crash notifications to emergency medical workers. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are along for the ride. Seats are climate controlled, with a massage feature available.Passengers in Row 2 should have no problem getting comfortable. Seats slide forward and backward, so legroom is what you make it. This row also has heated seats and dual climate zones. Average-size adults will be O.K. in Row 3 for short distances, but without the seat-heating or climate-control features.As with most S.U.V.s in this class, cargo room is scarce when all the seats are in use. Power-operated seatbacks with controls near the back door and in the trunk help shorter owners wrangle items in the cargo bay. A kick-to-open tailgate is a godsend when arms are filled with groceries or squirming children.There appears to be less grace in this second-generation Q7\u2019s crisp and clean design; it looks more like the box the first one came in. Still, the 2017 Q7 is a formidable competitor. It helps with the chores, pampers the family and entertains the driver.And now much lighter, it has become the heavyweight of the middleweight S.U.V.s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Plan: More Models, More Self-Driving", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Despite federal safety investigations of Tesla\u2019s self-driving cars, the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, is hardly backing off on his grand plans for autonomous vehicles.He made no mention of the fatal May 7 accident involving a Tesla Model S with its Autopilot system engaged, or of the federal scrutiny of the technology. A criticism of that system has been that, despite its name, its collision-avoidance abilities depend on the human driver\u2019s being ready to immediately retake control of the vehicle in a crisis.In his blog post, Mr. Musk indicated that the eventual focus would be on vehicles that fully drive themselves. And he doubled down on promises to improve Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving systems, as part of a major expansion of its product line.\u201cAs the technology matures, all Tesla vehicles will have the hardware necessary to be fully self-driving with fail-operational capability, meaning that any given system could break down and your car will drive itself safety,\u201d he said in the post.Mr. Musk, however, gave no timetable for the technology and acknowledged that regulators were moving cautiously before approving vehicles that drive themselves.\u201cThere will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators,\u201d he said.Two federal agencies, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, are investigating Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system, in particular its emergency braking function.The Transportation Department is also developing initial guidelines for self-driving vehicles that could transform the automotive landscape and open the door for autonomous models from a number of manufacturers.Mr. Musk\u2019s strategy also included a vigorous defense of his proposal to merge Tesla, which is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, with SolarCity, a money-losing solar-panel maker in which he has a major ownership stake.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.He said Tesla\u2019s mission to build zero-emission vehicles and battery packs would be complemented by SolarCity\u2019s sales of solar panels. \u201cThe time has come to bring them together,\u201d he said.A major expansion of Tesla\u2019s California car assembly plant is already underway to increase production to fill more than 300,000 orders for its planned Model 3 sedan, whose price of about $35,000 would be about half that of the Model S.The company is also preparing to begin production of batteries at a new factory in Nevada.But Mr. Musk is already setting bigger targets for future electric vehicles.He said the company was developing a compact sport utility vehicle, a \u201cnew kind\u201d of pickup truck, buses for public transit and the Tesla Semi truck, which could be unveiled as soon as next year.But while Mr. Musk is envisioning a wide-ranging line of future products, analysts are more concerned with Tesla\u2019s ability to deliver on its current expansion plans.\u201cElon Musk has laid out a grandiose plan for the future with no time frames and few specifics, and no mention of how and when Tesla will be profitable,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm AutoTrader.Another analyst, Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds.com, said Mr. Musk was further differentiating Tesla from traditional automakers.\u201cTesla\u2019s goals are far different from that of other automakers because they start and end with completely eliminating the need for fossil fuels,\u201d she said. \u201cIts competition, meanwhile, is focused on mobility solutions first and energy sources second.\u201dThe competition, too, is mainly making money. On Thursday, for example, General Motors said it had a profit of about $2.9 billion in the second quarter, in which it sold 2.4 million vehicles globally.That compares with the 14,000 vehicles Tesla has said it delivered to customers in the second quarter. The company is not scheduled to announce its second-quarter financial results until Aug. 3.In the first quarter, Tesla lost $282 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley-Driven Hype for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionHere\u2019s another view: Mr. Brown may be the first casualty of the widespread and potentially dangerous belief that autonomous cars are much closer to being road-ready than they actually are.Mr. Brown, who died in Florida on May 7, does not appear to have been heeding an important rule in the official instruction manual for the Tesla Autopilot feature he was using: Drivers should keep their hands on the wheel and be ready to resume control of the vehicle at any time.Instead, he seems to have been answering to a higher authority: Elon Musk, a founder and the chief executive of Tesla Motors.It wouldn\u2019t be fair to tar all of the growing self-driving industry with Mr. Musk\u2019s braggadocio. Nonetheless, his technological over-promising fits into a common narrative in Silicon Valley: The major engineering problems with self-driving cars have essentially been solved, and their widespread adoption is inevitable. Ask \u201cwhen?\u201d and you\u2019ll usually be told, \u201cMuch sooner than you think.\u201dAware of the conventional wisdom that robotic cars are about to cause an epochal \u201cdisruption,\u201d automakers are eager to demonstrate that they are fully engaged. A result has been a drumbeat of announcements auguring the imminent arrival of robotic cars, almost as though they were the next generation of iPhones. The breathless statements are especially beguiling for members of the public without the engineering background required to understand the challenges that remain. In other words, most people.Volvo, for example, recently announced a program called \u201cDrive Me London,\u201d which in two years will put 100 self-driving cars on the road in what it says will be the \u201cU.K.\u2019s most ambitious autonomous driving trial.\u201d Envisioning myself being driven around Trafalgar Square by a robot, I called up the company for more information. It turns out the news release didn\u2019t quite tell the whole story. I was told that all the autonomous driving will initially be limited to England\u2019s major motorways; everywhere else, the steering must still be done manually, including within London proper.Motorways and freeways are the low-hanging fruit of autonomous driving; everyone is moving in one direction at the same relative speed, and there are no pesky pedestrians to get in the way. Much of what is passed off today as \u201cautonomous driving\u201d is some variation of this sort of advanced cruise control.But there is an elephant in the cab with even this rudimentary form of autonomy. Many companies are planning cars that, in the event of an emergency, hand back control to the human driver. (Google, a notable exception, plans a car with no steering wheel or brake pedal.) The potentially fatal weakness of this strategy is that it assumes \u201cdrivers\u201d will be paying attention at the split second they are most needed, instead of being busy, say, taking a nap.The much harder, and still mainly unsolved, autonomous driving problem involves not highways but cities, with all their chaos and complexity. Self-driving cars still struggle with simple potholes; no one has come even close to demonstrating a completely driverless car that could do the work of a Manhattan taxi driver on a rainy day.The sad reality of autonomous car technology is that the easy parts of have yet to be proven safe, and the hard parts have yet to be proven possible. We\u2019re nowhere close to Silicon Valley\u2019s automotive \u201cTomorrowland.\u201dThe most realistic industry projection about the arrival of autonomous driving comes from the company that\u2019s done the most to make it possible. Google, while never explicitly saying so, has long intimated that self-driving cars would be available by the end of the decade.Historians of technology know that \u201cin 30 years\u201d often ends up being \u201cnever.\u201d Even if that\u2019s not the case here, if you\u2019re expecting a self-driving car, you should also expect a wait. And so you might want to do something to pass the time. Maybe go for a nice drive?Lee Gomes is a former technology reporter for The Wall Street Journal.Advertisement"}

And it does not have a \u201cLike\u201d button.The shift was evident in a Lowe\u2019s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries.The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.Silicon Valley\u2019s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing self-driving cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a half-dozen types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized.\u201cWe saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom \u2014 there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,\u201d said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco.Funding in A.I. start-ups has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1.2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year.\u201cWhenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,\u201d said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. \u201cBut you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don\u2019t happen every day.\u201dSilicon Valley\u2019s new A.I. era underscores the region\u2019s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend.\u201cThis is at the heart of the region\u2019s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. \u201cThe valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning.\u201dThe change spurred a rush for talent in A.I. that has become intense.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. \u201cThe number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy.\u201dThe valley\u2019s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region\u2019s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a consumer-electronics manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the mid-1970s. A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet.A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would \u2014 for at least another generation \u2014 remain the world\u2019s innovation center.How far the A.I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today\u2019s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have human-level intelligence.Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A.I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of start-ups. Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the \u201cA.I. Winter.\u201dThe current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong.\u201cThere is no chance of a new winter,\u201d said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence start-ups.John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A.I. companies. \u201cYou get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,\u201d he said.For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A.I. companies in the 1980s \u2014 Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down \u2014 the Valley\u2019s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered.\u201cSometimes when I hang around with A.I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Self-Driving Cars Hit the Road, Innovation Is Outpacing Insurance", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byAdvances in self-driving car technology have gotten ahead of insurers\u2019 ability to factor the systems into auto premiums.So at least for now, coverage for cars using self-driving technology works the same way as coverage for traditional vehicles, according to the insurance industry.A recent fatality involving a Tesla Model S electric sedan using the company\u2019s Autopilot system has focused attention on the risks of new \u201cautonomous driving\u201d technology. But the insurance claims process for cars using the systems generally works the same way as for cars without them, said Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group.That is, when an investigation of the accident is completed, the insurer of the driver at fault pays for injuries and damage to the others, up to the limits of the policy. (Mr. Hartwig said he was speaking generally, and was not privy to the details of any applicable insurance in the Tesla accident.)While there is a potential question about whether the driver or the software was at fault, he said, in practice the insurer would typically pay the claim and then have the right to \u201csubrogate,\u201d or file a claim against someone else, like the manufacturer or another insurer, to recoup its payment. (There is no exclusion in auto policies for software defects, he said.)Khobi Brooklyn, a Tesla spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement that the company\u2019s Autopilot system \u201cdoes not turn a Tesla into an autonomous vehicle and does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility.\u201dTesla markets its cars to the public, and drivers generally must carry state-mandated minimum liability insurance, which pays for damage to other people, cars and property. (New Hampshire is the sole state that doesn\u2019t require liability coverage.)However, Mr. Hartwig said, insurers may not know they are providing coverage for a potentially self-driving car. Generally, the owner of a new car contacts the insurer to request a quote for coverage. The owner typically provides the vehicle identification number, which identifies the specific make and model of the car \u2014 in this case, a Tesla Model S. But the identification number would not necessarily inform the insurer of the various options chosen on the car, Mr. Hartwig said, or whether the owner had activated the Autopilot software.Insurers are likely to begin inquiring about those details more often, he said.Paul Grieco, a lawyer representing the family of the deceased Tesla driver, Joshua Brown, said on Sunday that Mr. Brown had a \u201cstandard\u201d auto insurance policy covering the Tesla, but he declined to identify the carrier.Mr. Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed on May 7 when the Tesla he was operating collided with a tractor-trailer in Williston, Fla. Tesla has confirmed that the Autopilot feature, which the company described as being in a \u201cpublic beta\u201d test, was activated before the crash.Florida authorities and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are investigating.Many truly self-driving cars are part of fleets being tested by auto manufacturers or companies like Google, rather than cars sold to private buyers. Such companies typically self-insure or carry special fleet insurance that applies if the cars are involved in an accident, said Hilary Rowen, a lawyer with Sedgwick in San Francisco who represents insurers.Features like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, Ms. Rowen said, should really be considered driver-assisted systems, rather than true self-driving technology, which allows the driver to be a mere passenger. Tesla\u2019s system is a sophisticated combination of various driver-assist features, she said, but Tesla warns drivers to \u201ckeep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\u201dMr. Hartwig said it was too soon to say how self-driving systems would affect insurance rates. \u201cThe technology is so new that there\u2019s not a lot of actuarial data\u201d to determine whether it significantly affects the frequency or severity of accidents, he said. Insurers, as they have done with other advances, from seatbelts to newer features like airbags and rollover prevention systems, gather information over time and adjust rates to reflect the impact of the changes, if warranted, he said.But the very nature of self-driving technology may make it challenging to apply data from the cars to insurance premiums, Ms. Rowen said. \u201cThis is going to be a disruptive technology for the insurance industry,\u201d she said. That is because computer software running the systems is continuously updated. So while insurers generally track trends with a certain make and model of car, the safety performance of an individual self-driving car may actually change over time, as software updates correct problems.These issues will probably take as much as a decade to sort out, she said. In the future, during the claims process insurers may seek data from more sophisticated versions of black-box recorders to shed light on the cause of an accident. \u201cIs it a driver problem?\u201d she asked. \u201cA software problem? Or some sort of muddle of the two?\u201dA picture with an article on Monday about the challenge of self-driving vehicles to the automobile insurance industry was published in error.

(The app\u2019s instructions for the 2015 Grand Cherokee gearshift, accompanied by a photo illustration, flag an important point that perhaps too many people have missed, \u201cThe electronic shift lever in this vehicle does not slide like a conventional shifter.\u201d)Along with other carmakers, Fiat Chrysler has come to realize that consumers these days are as unlikely to read the voluminous owner\u2019s manual traditionally stuffed in the glove box as they are to read a printed telephone book.So auto companies increasingly are using apps, onscreen displays, videos and other technological means to familiarize the digitally adept buyer with the multitude of features in their highly computerized vehicles.\u201cThe question is, What do millennials expect from their cars, now that they view them as an operating system?\u201d said Prof. Maggie Hendrie, chairwoman of the Interaction Design program at ArtCenter College of Design, in Los Angeles.\u201cToday, we learn about a car\u2019s functions through trial and error,\u2019\u2019 Professor Hendrie said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we expect context-specific help built into the vehicle.\u201dOr we might look at the YouTube videos created by vehicle fans, as well as online forums populated by a particular make\u2019s enthusiasts, which often provide better answers than the pages written by a manufacturer.\u201cIf I ever had an issue with my car, I\u2019d do a Google search before I read the manual,\u201d said Akshay Anand, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.In some ways Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and other digital adopters are simply trying to catch up to their user communities. But they are also adopting digital instructions because cars have become so complex and feature-laden that printed manuals, with their step-by-step instructions and myriad legal warnings, are becoming unwieldy.If Fiat Chrysler still printed its manual, it would be 700 pages long and contain 240,000 words, said Tricia Hecker, head of the company\u2019s connected vehicle group. (Longer, for comparison\u2019s sake, than Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u2019\u2019)Fiat Chrysler first went to a digital user\u2019s guide in 2009, mainly as a money-saving step when the company was in dire financial straits. But the initial effort was blandly utilitarian. \u201cIt was just a regurgitation of the printed manual,\u201d Ms. Hecker said.Today, though, the company offers smartphone app versions of all its vehicle manuals. Users can search for instructions by topic, concept or alphabetically. Videos are often embedded in the instructions.The Fiat Chrysler app also gives users a place to write and email pertinent information after an accident, as well as a listing of maintenance schedules, active recalls and an accessory shop.Toyota\u2019s owner\u2019s manuals are available as smartphone apps and on the website. But rather than being reimagined for the screen, Toyota\u2019s digital manuals are simply shrunken pages of the paper ones. The company also continues to offer paper manuals in all its vehicles, to accommodate older buyers.\u201cWe\u2019re sticking with paper; some generations love the paper version,\u201d said Brian Williams, head of the company\u2019s marketing and product education division. \u201cSometimes you may not have your phone or be near a website, and it\u2019s also a lot quicker to flip through the paper index.\u201dFor those willing to click beyond the mini-manual pages, Toyota offers how-to videos. The app also displays explanations of dashboard warnings and can be used to schedule service, view the vehicle\u2019s service history or request roadside assistance.\u201cPeople don\u2019t see manuals as something you can learn from,\u201d said Manish Mehrotra, senior group manager for digital business and connected operations at Hyundai.Although Hyundai still provides paper manuals and web-based PDF versions, the company has also introduced an augmented-reality feature to its app. Point the smartphone at the engine, exterior, or interior of one of its vehicles, and an exploded three-dimensional view of various parts appear on the screen, with explanatory videos and operating instructions.Limited augmented reality is also available with Fiat Chrysler\u2019s owners\u2019 app. By hovering a smartphone over the vehicle instrument cluster, users can read text-based explanations of each warning light\u2019s function.An owner\u2019s app for BMWs performs a similar function to help users solve the riddles of the various buttons in the car.Manufacturers are also beginning to make some of the information on the smartphone apps available through the vehicle\u2019s dashboard digital display. Fiat Chrysler has done so for its Chrysler 300 and Pacifica models, as well as the Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger, showing users how to connect a garage door opener to the vehicle\u2019s controls.Since this migration, use of the app\u2019s help feature has risen to 16 percent of owners, from only 5 percent before, Ms. Hecker said.Tesla, the maker of expensive all-electric cars, has always offered its owner\u2019s guide through its vehicles\u2019 giant 17-inch touch screens. And just as a Tesla car regularly receives software updates from the cloud to alter the vehicle\u2019s functionality, so too is the instruction manual always kept up-to-date via software downloads.Future systems will not always wait for a driver to ask how to do something. Instead, they might sense what the driver needs and proactively offer to help. Chrysler, for example, is at work on an app that would not merely offer an explanation of how to connect a garage door to the vehicle\u2019s HomeLink system but also notice when the driver has not done it and ask if he or she would like to know how.In a system under development at Hyundai, once an owner begins to schedule service and indicates what times would be convenient, the car\u2019s screen will offer a list of available appointment times.\u201cThe printed car manual feels like a relic,\u201d said Professor Hendrie. \u201cImagine a dynamic manual that gives you information, just in time, knowing who you are, and how you\u2019re driving. It\u2019s up to us to figure out how people learn today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rosekind.\u201cWe know we need a national testing and validation site,\u201d Senator Peters said at an automotive digital security conference here. \u201cWe need one in place where all the auto companies can come together.\u201dThe senator said such a facility was needed to help keep the United States competitive in the race to develop the self-driving cars of the future. China, Japan, Germany and Sweden are also rushing to set up testing centers.The early trials of autonomous technology typically have taken place in closed proving grounds that automakers have used for decades. But more and more, testing is being done on public roads.Google\u2019s fleet of driverless test cars has logged more than 1.5 million miles driving in California and elsewhere. General Motors has outfitted a small number of Chevrolet Bolt electric cars with autonomous technology and is \u201crunning them around San Francisco,\u201d Mary Barra, the company\u2019s chief executive, said. Ford Motor is assembling a fleet of 30 self-driving cars that will be tested on public roads.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is being developed as customers are using it. The company describes its launch of the technology as only a \u201cbeta\u201d test, and says it is gathering data from vehicles equipped with it to perfect the system.The fatal Tesla crash, which occurred on May 7 but was first made public by the highway safety agency on June 30, \u201cheightens the need\u201d for a cooperative test center, Senator Peters said.Mr. Brown was in his 2015 Tesla Model S, traveling about 65 miles per hour, when it crashed into a tractor-trailer crossing the roadway in Williston, Fla. Tesla, whose vehicles have the ability to send the company data on their operating conditions, has said that the Autopilot was engaged at the time, and that neither Mr. Brown nor the system activated the brakes before impact.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system scans the road with radar and cameras, but it failed to see the white truck against a bright sky, according to the company. The highway safety agency is investigating whether the incident resulted from a flaw in Tesla\u2019s technology. The National Transportation Safety Board, which more often looks into airplane and train accidents, is also investigating the crash.At the Billington Global Automotive Cybersecurity Summit here, Mr. Rosekind, the highway safety administrator, declined to comment on his agency\u2019s investigation. But he said he believed autonomous-driving technology could eventually save thousands of lives and wants carmakers to continue developing it rapidly.\u201cThere will be incidents, but we can\u2019t wait for the perfect,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Mr. Foxx confirmed that the secretary met with the Michigan representatives on Friday. Their proposal to initiate a competition among facilities to be chosen as a national testing center is under consideration, the spokesman said.Senator Peters said a national testing center was critical to accelerating development of the technology while minimizing the risk of accidents. He and Representative Dingell urged Mr. Foxx and Mr. Rosekind to solicit proposals from potential test sites.The Willow Run site is much larger and would allow automakers to test self-driving cars at highway speeds and in more complex environments. Its roadways include overpasses and bridges.The Willow Run location in Michigan is close to technical centers operated by several automakers, including G.M., Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai. Google\u2019s self-driving car test is also opening an engineering center in Michigan.Senator Peters said the concentration of automotive companies would make the Willow Run complex a top choice for the kind of national center he is advocating.An article on Saturday about a search by the federal government and the automobile industry for a testing site for autonomous vehicles misidentified the company that made bombers during World War II on a Michigan site that is in contention. It was Ford Motor \u2014 not General Motors, which bought the site in the 1950s.Advertisement"}

The Department of Transportation gets involved only when a problem is detected.From the initial information about the crash, the system apparently failed in pattern recognition, which, at its most basic, distinguishes between visually ambiguous objects. In a press release, Tesla said, \u201cNeither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\u201dThere are other examples of pattern recognition that are known to cause difficulties for self-driving systems or which are difficult (but doable) for human drivers and haven\u2019t yet been solved for autonomous systems. They include the detection of downed power lines (difficult to detect at all, then to interpret), flooded roads (water may appear to be the road surface), large potholes and road debris (some are potentially damaging, some not), temporary traffic-control devices (unexpected but critical to respond to appropriately), fire and smoke on or near the road (may not be detected by all required sensors) or other unusual hazards.Pattern recognition is not the only aspect of self-driving vehicle performance that needs testing. We should also assess each vehicle\u2019s sensing hardware, software and decision algorithms in situations ranging from the mundane \u2014 driving on a sunny day in little traffic \u2014 to those that pose potential problems for human and computer drivers alike, like driving at night in rain with glare reflected from wet roads.And other issues need testing, too. First, the cars\u2019 visual and sensing abilities in bad weather are still subpar; manufacturers admit that rain and especially snow pose major obstacles. Second, self-driving vehicles have not been tested thoroughly under a variety of demanding conditions, such as driving at night or on poorly marked or unmapped roads. Third, self-driving vehicles will face the occasional ethical dilemma in their decision making: If a crash is unavoidable, should the car hit the other vehicle or the pedestrian nearby?Given the potential safety implications, we need standardized, comprehensive tests of driverless technology.We should establish a graduated license system similar to that in place for human drivers, in which the license for a class of self-driving vehicle is limited to the situations that it can safely negotiate. A full license would be granted only when the vehicles pass an unrestricted test.Self-driving vehicles are not specifically regulated on a federal level, although the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is developing guidelines. (Eight states and the District of Columbia have basic legislation to allow driving or testing on their roads.) Since the authority to set vehicle-safety standards for vehicle manufacturers rests with the federal government, the highway administration should take the lead in defining the specific requirements for the licensing test.We have tests for driver\u2019s licenses because people differ in their skills and abilities. Systems for self-driving vehicles are no different in this respect: When we share the road, we need to know who, or what, is behind the wheel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Water Out of the Tailpipe: A New Class of Electric Car Gains Traction", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byWheelsSTEVE MANNING, a financial consultant in Southern California, liked the idea of driving a car that would go easy on the environment.But last November, as he eyed a $58,000 Toyota Mirai at the dealership near his home in Santa Ana, he had to think more than twice.This was not just any electric car. Its electricity comes from fuel cells powered by hydrogen, which means the only tailpipe emissions are water vapor. That would be good for the climate, but a logistical challenge for the consumer.In Mr. Manning\u2019s case the nearest hydrogen filling station was seven miles from his house. And the technology was still so new that there were fewer than a dozen others in the entire state.\u201cIs this really practical?\u201d he asked himself. In the end, he took a leap of faith, agreeing to lease a silver Mirai for $499 a month. \u201cI said, \u2018If it sucks, it sucks,\u2019\u201d he recalled in a recent telephone interview.He has no regrets. Because of a big push by the State of California to invest in a growing network of filling stations, he has never run out of fuel. Driving a hydrogen-powered car has proved a pleasant surprise to Mr. Manning and others in California\u2019s small but growing cadre of owners of fuel-cell cars.Like other electrics, the Mirai does not have a transmission and accelerates quickly from a stop. \u201cI can burn rubber,\u201d said Glenn Rambach, a retired engineer who bought one last fall.But its attributes don\u2019t include being cheap to operate. A fill-up to drive 300 miles costs about $75. Mirai owners, though, get a credit card, paid by Toyota, for up to $15,000 of fuel over the first three years of ownership.For years, automakers, environmentalists and scientists have promoted hydrogen fuel cells as a breakthrough technology that will eventually enable people to travel without puffing pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Fuel cells operate by setting off a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the air. When they bond, an electric charge and a small amount of water are created. A few hundred cells stacked together generate enough electricity to power a car motor.And compared with other types of electric cars, which must be recharged by drawing power from some sort of electricity, hydrogen fuel-cell cars do not need recharging and have a longer cruising range. (Not that hydrogen, which is sold as a highly compressed gas provided by industrial suppliers, is easy for any home chemist to produce in sufficient, useful quantities.)But the hydrogen future has been slow to arrive because of a frustrating predicament: Automakers had little incentive to produce fuel-cell vehicles as long as there were no hydrogen stations to fill them up; energy companies saw no sense in opening stations if there were no cars on the market.So it took financial backing from the State of California, as well as Toyota, Honda and other automakers, to spur development of hydrogen fueling stations. Twenty are now open to the public, and three more go into service this month. The number should rise to 50 by the end of next year, according to California officials.California also encourages zero-emission cars by letting them use the swift, high-occupancy vehicle lanes on the famously crowded freeways. The state also offers tax rebates to consumers who buy or lease hydrogen-powered cars, which in the case of the Mirai is worth $5,000 \u2014 in addition to a $8,000 federal tax credit.But California is a rarity. Other than some experimental publicly supported projects with hydrogen fuel-cell cars in Washington and the Northeast, there is no hydrogen fueling-station network elsewhere in the United States to support the sale and use of the cars.And only a few other countries in the world actively support the technology.Japan, where Toyota has been selling the Mirai since late 2014, now has about 80 fueling stations. South Korea has about a dozen hydrogen stations and is investing to build more as Hyundai nears the debut of its Ioniq fuel-cell car.In Europe, Mirai sales recently started in Denmark, which has nine stations, as well as in Britain, Belgium and Germany. But Toyota expects to sell only about 100 of the vehicles in Europe this year.Mr. Manning now has enough fueling options in Southern California to cover his 45-mile commute to Playa Vista with little anxiety. He runs 90 miles down to San Diego three or four times a month, a trip that consumes more than a half a tank of hydrogen. But now he can swing off the freeway to a station in San Juan Capistrano to top off along the way.\u201cI have a pickup truck, but I don\u2019t drive it that much anymore,\u201d Mr. Manning said. \u201cI love to drive the Mirai. I get a lot of people who want to take pictures of it.\u201dDespite the support of California\u2019s government, which has set aside $46.6 million to subsidize the development of a hydrogen station network, \u201cit\u2019s going to take some time for this to really take off,\u201d said Shane Stephens, chief development officer at FirstElement Fuel, a start-up that has received a grant from the state and operates a chain of 13 TrueZero fueling stations, with six more under construction.\u201cBut people are feeling more positive,\u201d Dr. Stephens said. \u201cThere\u2019s a line of sight to see that this can be successful.\u201dFewer than 350 hydrogen cars are currently registered in the state, and Toyota expects the total of Mirais to be only about 3,000 by the end of next year. But California officials predict that more than 13,000 hydrogen cars will be in operation on its roads by 2019.And after Toyota introduces a new version of the Mirai around 2020, the company thinks its sales will rise to about 30,000 cars a year.Honda plans to sell a hydrogen-powered Clarity sedan by the end of the year. Hyundai, which has been leasing limited numbers of hydrogen-powered Tucson sport utility vehicles, plans to sell hydrogen-powered Ioniqs in the state in 2017.Mark Johannessen, a family law attorney who lives in West Sacramento, bought a Mirai late last year and had \u201ca bit of a nail-biter\u201d early on while driving the car 115 miles to an office in Santa Cruz. \u201cI had about five miles left in the tank,\u201d he recalled. But two stations have since opened along his route.Fuel-cell technology has its detractors, mostly because of the question about fueling stations. Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, has called hydrogen \u201can incredibly dumb\u201d way to power cars.Still, other automakers are convinced that hydrogen fuel-cell will become a crucial piece of the industry\u2019s future. Battery electric vehicles are still limited to a maximum of about 200 miles of driving before a recharge is required, and charging up can take time \u2014 four hours or more in some cases. Batteries are also heavy, which presents challenges for powering larger vehicles like trucks or S.U.V.s.Fuel-cell vehicles, on the other hand, can go up to 300 miles on a full tank. Refueling is about the same process as filling up with gasoline and takes three to four minutes.And though hydrogen might be associated in some people\u2019s minds with the fiery explosion of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship in 1937, proponents say the fuel system as designed in the Mirai and other comparable cars make them no more volatile than gasoline-powered vehicles.\u201cIf we\u2019re really going to make a significant reduction in carbon emissions, you can only do that with fuel-cell vehicles in the mix,\u201d said Craig Scott, national manager of advanced technologies at Toyota.Mr. Rambach, the retired engineer, shares that view.He puts about 1,000 miles on the car a month, driving into Sacramento, where he gives tours at an auto museum, and taking occasional 130-mile trips to the San Francisco area. And since a new station recently opened up in Truckee, near Tahoe, he\u2019s able to use the Mirai for the 100 miles up to skiing country.Mr. Rambach\u2019s other car is a Lexus hybrid, but he\u2019s grown to enjoy the quiet and smooth ride of the Mirai. \u201cEvery time I go out to the garage,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cit\u2019s the Mirai I want to drive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect amount for a federal tax credit for buying a Mirai hydrogen-powered car. It is $8,000, not $4,000.Advertisement"}
