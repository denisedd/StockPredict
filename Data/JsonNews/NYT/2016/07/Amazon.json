{"Headline": "Amazon Is Quietly Eliminating List Prices", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In a major shift for online commerce, Amazon is quietly changing how it entices people to buy.The retailer built a reputation and hit $100 billion in annual revenue by offering deals. The first thing a potential customer saw was a bargain: how much an item was reduced from its list price.Now, in many cases, Amazon has dropped any mention of a list price. There is just one price. Take it or leave it.The new approach comes as discounts both online and offline have become the subject of dozens of consumer lawsuits for being much less than they seem. It is also occurring while Amazon is in the middle of an ambitious multiyear shift from a store selling one product at a time to a full-fledged ecosystem. Amazon wants to be so deeply embedded in a customer\u2019s life that buying happens as naturally as breathing, and nearly as often.\u201cWhen Amazon began 21 years ago, the strategy was to lose on every sale but make it up on volume,\u201d said Larry Compeau, a Clarkson University professor of consumer studies. \u201cIt was building for the future, and the future has arrived. Amazon doesn\u2019t have to seduce customers with a deal because they\u2019re going to buy anyway.\u201dOr so Amazon hopes. Digital stores live by Alec Baldwin\u2019s maxim in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d: \u201cAlways be closing.\u201d The retailer has been experimenting with another method of closing a sale. It tells the potential buyer what the price used to be on Amazon.That is why stores love big discounts: they work. In studies by Mr. Compeau and others, the perception of a deal is often what makes the purchase happen.\u201cWe\u2019ve been conditioned to buy only when things are on sale,\u201d said Bonnie Patten, executive director of TruthInAdvertising.org, a consumer information site. \u201cAs a result, what many retailers have done is make sure everything is always on sale. Which means nothing is ever on sale.\u201dAmazon has both benefited from that conditioning as well as encouraged it, which is most likely why it is changing cautiously. It began eliminating list prices about two months ago, pricing specialists say, both on products it sold itself and those sold by other merchants on its site. The retailer did not return multiple requests for comment.\u201cOur data suggests that list prices are going away,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm. Last spring, Boomerang compiled a list for The New York Times of 100 pet food products that Amazon said it was selling at a discount to a list price. Only about half of them still say that.\u201cAmazon is a data-driven company with very few sacred cows,\u201d Mr. Hariharan said. \u201cAt the very least, it is conducting a storewide test about whether it should change its pricing strategy.\u201dOver the Fourth of July weekend, the list price was gone for 39 of those products. The Infuser page, for instance, simply said what it would cost to buy at that moment, which was $483. Nineteen of the product pages tried to encourage a sale by pointing out that the price used to be higher on Amazon, although no time period was given.\u201cAmazon is showing it can fix the problem if it wants to,\u201d Ms. Patten said.There have been at least 10 settlements. In April, a Los Angeles judge gave preliminary approval to a $6 million offer by Kohl\u2019s Department Stores. That deal came on the heels of a $50 million preliminary settlement by J. C. Penney.Mr. Kovarik of Rout said his analysis indicated that Amazon was regularly eliminating more list prices. \u201cIn early May, about 29 percent of the products we saw were missing list prices, but now the number is up to about 70 percent,\u201d he said.Amazon has always focused on driving revenue while disregarding profits. That had many implications: It was driven to try new things; it could undercut any competitor who focused on price; it could literally buy customer loyalty.In Amazon\u2019s third decade, with its complete domination of the e-commerce landscape, there are signs it is beginning to emphasize the value each customer brings.\u201cThey are trying to figure out what product categories have customers who are so tied into the Amazon ecosystem that list prices are no longer necessary,\u201d Mr. Compeau, of Clarkson, said. In some categories, like groceries, Amazon seems to be using just one price, the buy-it-now price.If Amazon brings the milk and music into your house, not to mention videos and e-books and the devices to consume them on, as well as a hot dinner and just about any other object you could want, that presents a pricing challenge of a different sort. Untangling what those deals are worth \u2014 as opposed to what they cost \u2014 is probably impossible.\u201cTwenty years ago, we were hesitant to trust online companies with our credit card information,\u201d Mr. Compeau observed. \u201cNow we\u2019re being asked to trust them completely.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taser International Dominates the Police Body Camera Market", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byWhen Micah Johnson went on a deadly shooting rampage in Dallas last week, body cameras worn by police officers were rolling, capturing at least 170 hours of video of the mayhem.That footage is now stored on a sophisticated cloud computing system that lets police manage digital evidence and hosts more hours of video than Netflix has available to stream.These paired offerings \u2014 body cameras for police and cloud storage \u2014 have transformed policing in recent years, adding a new level of transparency and accountability but also raising questions about privacy and who has the right to view those videos.Behind the scenes, one company is at the center of it all: Taser International. Best known for making Taser stun guns, it controls about three-quarters of the body camera business in the United States.Until recently a one-note provider of electrical weapons, Taser has swiftly cornered the market for body cameras and related software, making it one of the most important suppliers of technology to law enforcement today.Its Axon body cameras are worn by officers in dozens of big cities including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington and, yes, Dallas. And using computing power from Microsoft and Amazon, Taser runs Evidence.com, the site that lets police host and manage body camera video.Demand for the products has soared in the two years since Michael Brown was shot dead by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., and analysts now estimate that the market will soon be worth $1 billion a year.\u201cWhen the rest of us are snapping pictures and videos, police can\u2019t pull out a note pad and start writing,\u201d said Patrick W. Smith, the chief executive of Taser. \u201cThere\u2019s now an expectation from society that they\u2019re getting good documentation of what they\u2019re involved in. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to know what happened.\u201dMr. Smith and his brother, Thomas, founded Taser in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1993, and the company now is worth about $1.3 billion. Taser cameras have captured thousands of altercations between the police and the public and several controversial police shootings, including ones in Albuquerque and Cincinnati.Yet as Taser works to sell cameras and software to more departments, it is coming under fire for questionable business practices. In some instances, it has paid police chiefs to travel to Taser conferences. In other cases, chiefs who have bought Taser products have joined the company as consultants shortly after leaving public service. And several cities have awarded contracts to Taser without competitive bidding.So far, these issues have done little to blunt Taser\u2019s momentum. Last quarter, for the first time, Taser booked more sales for body cameras and related software than it did for its stun guns.Interest in body cameras was already picking up two years ago, as police departments around the country started responding to calls for greater accountability. Then, in August 2014, a white police officer killed Mr. Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson. The officer was not wearing a body camera, and witnesses disputed his account of the altercation that led to the shooting. The officer was not charged, and critics said that had he been wearing a body camera, the outcome might have been different.At times, the video can exonerate officers. In 2009, shortly after Taser began selling its cameras through its Axon division, Sgt. Brandon Davis shot and killed a man in Fort Smith, Ark. Video recorded by his body camera captured the shooting, and Mr. Davis was cleared of wrongdoing.In other instances, the footage can portray police as needlessly aggressive. In 2014, a Taser Axon camera worn by an officer in Albuquerque captured the fatal shooting of a homeless man by officers who did not appear to be threatened. The two officers have been charged with second-degree murder and are expected to stand trial soon.Even when body cameras are worn, they are not always effective. When two police officers fatally shot Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., on July 5, they were wearing body cameras made by a Taser competitor. A police spokesman said the cameras became dislodged during the altercation with Mr. Sterling, and the video was unlikely to reveal much; Baton Rouge is making a transition to Taser cameras.In another incident last week, the officer who killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn., was not wearing a body camera. But Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live.\u201cThe whole world wants to know what the heck happened in the moments leading up to that shooting,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Taser. \u201cWould a body camera have changed the behavior? Maybe. But it sure would have answered some questions.\u201dJust a few years ago, many police were reluctant to wear body cameras, fearing that their every action would be scrutinized.\u201cThere was a real hesitation at first,\u201d said Officer Jeff Garwacki, who oversees the body camera program at the Fort Worth Police Department.But as the devices have become more common, many police officers have come to rely on them. In Fort Worth, which has bought 800 body cameras from Taser and uses its Evidence.com service, Mr. Garwacki said most officers wanted to wear cameras at all times. \u201cThe body cameras are showing that the officers are doing what they say they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen police use body cameras and tell people that they are using them, it tends to produce better behavior by both the police and the public,\u201d said Chad Marlow, advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.Yet Mr. Marlow expressed concern that Taser had achieved such dominance in the body camera industry so quickly.\u201cThe fact that a lot of police departments are familiar with Taser has created an inclination to go with them,\u201d said Mr. Marlow. \u201cOther companies are not getting the opportunity to show off their products.\u201dSome of Taser\u2019s rivals, Mr. Marlow said, were developing software that made it easier to redact identifying features of people captured on camera, better protecting their privacy.There is no doubt that Taser has managed to use its longstanding relationships with police departments, which have used the company\u2019s stun guns for decades, to gain its early lead in the market for body cameras and related software.But several competitors, and some city officials, accuse the company of cozying up to police chiefs to secure lucrative contracts. Nearly all of the roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States have bought Taser\u2019s stun guns. \u201cTaser is very much intertwined with police departments,\u201d said Mark Strouse, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.In several instances around the country, Taser has either paid for the travel of police chiefs who went on to award the company contracts, or hired recently retired chiefs who had awarded Taser contracts.\u201cWe think there\u2019s an ongoing pattern of police chiefs getting lucrative consulting contracts after they retire, if they give Taser contracts,\u201d said Robert McKeeman, chief executive of Utility, which makes a rival body camera.Taser defended its sales tactics, saying they were commonplace, and said that many police departments were familiar with the company. It now makes law enforcement officials wait a year after leaving government service before it will hire them as consultants. Taser also said that while it was sometimes awarded sole-source bids, the departments doing the purchasing have often run a competitive process to test other cameras.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to solve customers\u2019 needs, you have to have close relationships,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything that was misleading.\u201dThe company struggled for several years. Ill-fated brand extensions like the Auto Taser, a device that electrified steering wheels to prevent car theft, nearly bankrupted the company.But sales picked up when Taser introduced a powerful electrical weapon, the M26, which resembled a handgun. Taser went public in 2001.The company began selling video recorders that worked with Taser weapons in 2006, and it introduced its first body camera, the Axon Pro, in 2009.Mr. Smith predicted that sales of Axon cameras and Evidence.com would soon dwarf sales of Taser\u2019s weapons, and that the company would one day be renamed to reflect the growing prominence of its body camera business.\u201cWe had a very successful business selling Taser weapons,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Given that the main rap against the show is its grim tone \u2014 as if seriousness and self-seriousness are conterminous phenomena \u2014 it\u2019s a useful tool for the series to have in its arsenal. On a surface level, this installment is concerned with some of the bleakest events in the story to date: the discovery of the old-school phone hacker Romero\u2019s corpse by his confederate Mobley, the latter\u2019s increasing conviction that their group has been marked for death by the fearsome organization the Dark Army, Elliot\u2019s desperate attempts to overdose himself out of his Mr. Robot persona\u2019s clutches, his garrulous new pal Ray\u2019s tragic and violent back story.

The former is the show at its creepiest, with frightening phone calls from the still-missing corporate cutthroat Tyrell Wellick (\u201cI think about you a lot, Elliot.

Even his vicious atheist rant at the church group he\u2019s been attending has the gravity let out when he ends it with \u201cPlease tell me I didn\u2019t say all of that out loud\u201d \u2014 a joke straight out of \u201cAustin Powers\u201d embedded in a show made with the experimental zeal of an art film.

{"Headline": "The World According to \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "FeatureThe show\u2019s creators have turned the travails of an anthropomorphic horse into a hilarious meditation on a peculiarly modern kind of unhappiness.Supported byThe first story described how Theodore Roosevelt handed the presidency to William Howard Taft. Displeased with Taft\u2019s performance, Roosevelt made a bid to regain the White House in 1912, which ended in a humiliating defeat. \u201cHe goes from being the most important person in the world to being a kind of fool,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. Roosevelt soon redeemed himself by embarking on a journey down a remote river in the Amazon. Eisner related Roosevelt\u2019s story to his own career: \u201cFor 40 years, I\u2019m the most important man in the room, and all of a sudden I thought the phone is never going to ring.\u201dWhich led him to his second parable of the evening, a tale about a figure somewhat less well known than the 26th president: the protagonist of an animated TV show that Eisner\u2019s production company, Tornante, had sold to Netflix. The show, \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d is about an anthropomorphic horse living in Los Angeles who suffers with existential, career and substance-abuse issues after the death of his sitcom.\u201cBoJack wants you to think he\u2019s still the most important person in the room,\u201d Eisner told Taylor. \u201cBut deep down, he knows he\u2019s not, and that is killing him.\u201d He tries to write his memoirs, but can\u2019t get started. Paparazzi birds torment him. He endures a withering mare of a mother and a Harvard-educated, name-dropping former writing partner named Cuddlywhiskers. He betrays everyone who tries to love him.The lesson for Bloomberg? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be sure you\u2019re not going to be embarrassed,\u201d Eisner said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t go dark.\u201dIt helps that \u201cBoJack\u201d is also funny. In the tradition of great melan-comedy predecessors like \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d and \u201cLouie,\u201d \u201cBoJack\u201d bites the hand that feeds it. Eisner claims the show is not just a Hollywood satire (\u201cNo one watches those\u201d), but it is centered on the travails of an actor for whom the trappings of success \u2014 money, a convertible, nubile fans \u2014 don\u2019t begin to make up for his has-been status.Superficially, the show is full of Sitcom 101 characters. There\u2019s the millennial wastrel Todd, who moved into BoJack\u2019s house, a modern monstrosity perched on a hill, five years ago and does nothing but eat breakfast cereal and smoke weed. There\u2019s Princess Carolyn, BoJack\u2019s ex/agent/sex buddy whom he disappoints not just romantically but also professionally, turning down every project she brings him. There\u2019s even a built-in frenemy, Mr. Peanutbutter, a yellow lab whose own former show, \u201cMr. Peanutbutter\u2019s House,\u201d was a rip-off of BoJack\u2019s long-running sitcom, \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around,\u201d in which he starred with three lovable orphans. But the characters on \u201cBoJack\u201d are deeper, and more complex, than those descriptions suggest. Todd, as his voice actor, Aaron Paul, says, may be \u201cthe first asexual character on television,\u201d and his loyalty to BoJack is often rewarded with heartbreaking indifference. Princess Carolyn is whip-smart, but her window to have kittens is closing; this she periodically regrets, blaming BoJack. And the more we watch Mr. Peanutbutter, the more apparent it is that, despite his career thievery, he\u2019s the simplest and most decent character on the show. All are at once infatuated with and repelled by BoJack.Still, for all this misanthropy and unremitting bleakness, BoJack retains our sympathy, especially as we see him wrestle with the damage inflicted by his twisted childhood. The offspring of a plow horse and a moody equine heiress to a sugar fortune, BoJack is raised primarily by network television, which he watches incessantly, even as his mother lectures him about how life is nothing but a pile of road apples. Like Sanders, BoJack just wants to be loved. The penultimate episode of the first season ends with BoJack\u2019s confronting the ghostwriter of his memoirs with an aching plea: \u201cI need you to tell me that I\u2019m a good person. ... Please, Diane, tell me that I\u2019m good.\u201d Before she can answer, a heckler interrupts, and the screen goes black.It\u2019s easy to assume that \u201cBoJack\u201d had its origins in the creative travails of 40-something television writers. But the idea actually sprang from the youthful angst of the show\u2019s creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg. Bob-Waksberg and his two younger sisters were raised in Palo Alto, Calif., by what he calls \u201ctwo professional Jews.\u201d His father helped Russian Jews emigrate from the Soviet Union; his mother owned a Jewish bookstore with his grandmother. He insists that his parents were the opposite of the stereotypically hard-charging Palo Alto parent \u2014 to whom some attributed the spate of suicides that have rocked Bob-Waksberg\u2019s high school in recent years \u2014 but he still struggled.He was repeatedly kicked out of class for being disruptive. When the principal refused to let him wear his beloved cycling cap in a school picture, he retaliated by shaving half his head on the quad. (He\u2019d already done the other half, which had given him a disturbing half-cherub-half-psycho look.) He missed field trips because he was sent to the principal\u2019s office so many times and ran with a group of \u201clike-minded weirdos,\u201d moving through the hallways with a frenetic, loud energy.There was a downside to his teenage charisma. Bob-Waksberg often pushed his jokes over the line, making his sister Becky and friends cry in frustration. \u201cI definitely have people who I went to high school with who would call me a bully,\u201d said Bob-Waksberg, who, at 31, still has the intense, spritelike energy of an adolescent. \u201cI would find something and tease them, which in my mind was harmless fun. And then they would go home and be like, Why is he so mean to me?\u201dAcademically, he floundered, but he sometimes won the lead in the school\u2019s theater productions, which led to his hanging out with a girl named Lisa Hanawalt, now the production designer and a producer on \u201cBoJack.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d riff on ideas for a TV show based on people we knew,\u201d Hanawalt remembers. \u201cWe\u2019d use that to make fun of them. Like, \u2018Oh, what if our friend was a pirate and he had a chicken on his shoulder instead of a parrot?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe two parted for college \u2014 Hanawalt, first, to U.C.L.A., then Bob-Waksberg to Bard \u2014 but stayed in touch, working on a comic via email. Within a decade, Hanawalt was a critically acclaimed illustrator and comics artist and Bob-Waksberg was making his way in Hollywood writing scripts, including one about three liars that morphed into a pilot about triplets. In 2010, he finally had an idea he really wanted to pursue, and he emailed Hanawalt.\u201cHey, do you have a picture of one of your horse guys, by himself? I came up with this idea for a show I\u2019d like to pitch. Tell me what you think: \u2018BoJack, the Depressed Talking Horse.\u2019\u2009\u201dAt first, Hanawalt thought the BoJack idea sounded sad and cynical, but she liked the horse part. As a kid, Hanawalt was so obsessed with horses that she sometimes walked on all fours. Her classmates called her Horse Poop and Lady Horse. After graduating from U.C.L.A., she cre\u00adated a comic book called \u201cExtra Egg Room\u201d about He-Horse, an anxiety-ridden horse. In another, she created She-Moose, an artist moose who lives with her boyfriend, a cat. She didn\u2019t draw on computers, so she did a series of watercolors of the main characters for \u201cBoJack.\u201d She advised Bob-Waksberg to make everything more animal-centric, suggesting that a Newton\u2019s Cradle in Princess Carolyn\u2019s office be strung with clanging mice instead of balls. BoJack\u2019s look came to her almost instantly \u2014 a mournful horse, too young to be wearing the Cosby sweaters he favors. She envisioned Diane as a bookish, Janeane Garofalo type. Hanawalt and her staff also provided many of the show\u2019s punning touches. Princess Carolyn\u2019s bookshelf includes the titles \u201cPurrity\u201d and \u201cPurrsepolis.\u201d Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s estate features a fire hydrant and countless portraits of dog butts and tennis balls.But BoJack still lives in a harsh realm. In the first five minutes of the first episode, he shows up drunk to a \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d interview and defends \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around.\u201d \u201cI think the show is actually pretty solid for what it is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not Ibsen, sure, but look \u2014 for a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra. Sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes everything is going to turn out O.K.\u201dBob-Waksberg manages a staff of nearly 100, but he drives a silver Prius that Eisner gave him after it became clear he would never dump his beat-up Dodge. He is a slight man, who despite his biting humor still cries at Hallmark-card commercials; his blue eyes dart constantly, as if he\u2019s thinking three moves ahead. He and Arnett eventually got down to reading lines for a scene in which BoJack thinks he has nabbed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Secretariat in a biopic. BoJack should be ecstatic, but told of the nomination, he just mutters, \u201cI feel the same.\u201dArnett read the line a few times in BoJack\u2019s most-important-horse-in-the-room baritone before Bob-Waksberg interrupted.\u201cSay it disappointed and weirded out.\u201dArnett added a pause and a note of bewildered anguish.\u201cI feel ... the same.\u201dThey moved on to the next line, which Bob-Waksberg asked Arnett to do with \u201cmore bouncy energy. \u2018It\u2019s happening again. Jesus Christ, I\u2019ll never be happy. Typical me.\u2019\u2009\u201dArnett nods.\u201cIt\u2019s happening again. ... Why do I always think things will make me happy?\u201dBob-Waksberg jolted his head up. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dWhen Arnett finished recording, he told me that what drew him to BoJack was that the horse was kind of a jackass. \u201cI love a flawed character more than anything.\u201dSuddenly, an eager assistant bolted through the door. She wanted to make sure Arnett\u2019s lunch order had been taken.\u201cThat was so Hollywood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got interrupted having a real conversation and asked what we wanted for lunch.\u201d We talked about the show for a while before Arnett steered the conversation to the crushing nature of Hollywood. \u201cThe brass ring here is so shiny and so big, and the possibilities endless. So people come here because they want to be a star, whatever that means \u2014 that is the pinnacle. So when it doesn\u2019t happen, bad things tend to happen.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see myself having grandchildren with her,\u201d he replied, with BoJackian dourness.\u201cI love Raphael,\u201d Conover, who now has his own comedy show on TruTV, told me. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy being a Mr. Peanutbutter type, because having that BoJack mentality where you\u2019re constantly processing things can\u2019t be easy.\u201dBut this churning over the meaning of existence has always defined Bob-Waksberg\u2019s comedy. In Olde English, an absurdist comedy troupe he and Conover joined at Bard, Bob-Waksberg often played the role of a clueless yet self-righteous millennial. The group was successful and cutthroat; it would meet often to jettison members who weren\u2019t carrying their weight, with one member ordered to deliver the blow. \u201cThe ultimate pejorative was if you came up with something and someone else described it as corny,\u201d Bob-Waksberg says.After graduating, the Olde English crew migrated to New York and tried to develop ideas. Before calling it quits, they produced some co\u00admedic gems, including a film called \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d a twist on the Surrealists\u2019 parlor game. Each member wrote 15 pages of the script, but the next member saw only the last five. The result is a glorious mess of tone changes and character U-turns interspersed with snippets of commentary. Bob-Waksberg\u2019s section features a speech delivered from a Santa Monica beach days after he moved to Los Angeles. Wearing a tie, he wonders about the project before going global:\u201cHere\u2019s the problem with everything. As soon as you get something you want \u2014 it\u2019s no longer a thing you want, it\u2019s just a thing you have, and then you want the next thing. So I\u2019m starting to realize maybe I\u2019ll never be satisfied. ... I\u2019ll find the girl of my dreams, I\u2019ll get married and I\u2019ll have kids. Then, like a week later, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, this is [expletive].\u2019\u2009\u201dThen a heckler with a football jumps in the frame and ruins the take.The episode opens with scenes of Charlotte\u2019s domestic bliss. When BoJack arrives, he says he\u2019s in town for the Santa Fe boat show and \u2014 to make the lie believable \u2014 buys a yacht that he parks in the driveway. Bob-Waksberg asked an assistant to freeze the screen.\u201cWe knew things were going to break bad here, but the idea was he was going to sleep with Charlotte,\u201d he recalled. Then someone in the writers\u2019 room suggested that BoJack try to bed Penny instead. \u201cOnce that was said out loud, sleeping with Charlotte just felt so boring and expected,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that genie back in the bottle.\u201d I asked him if he polled any outsiders about whether a middle-aged depressive trying to sleep with a high-school senior was over the line. He thought for a second. \u201cA friend left her sweater here, and her assistant came to pick it up, and we asked if it was too much, and she said, \u2018No, I\u2019d go with it,\u2019 and that was it.\u201dAs the episode unfolds, BoJack takes Penny for driving lessons. He contemplates staying and teaching theater at a local college, but this idea is never mentioned again. (The subplot that goes nowhere is something of a Bob-Waksberg trademark.) BoJack magnanimously offers to drive Penny and some friends to the prom. He teaches them that they don\u2019t have to fit in, but then he gets one of them drunk and dumps her at the E.R. with alcohol poisoning. Still, Penny is having a magical evening and is the one to make the first move.\u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m ready, I have condoms in my room, and I know how to put one on with my mouth.\u201d\u201cLast stop for gas,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said, as we watched. \u201cThat\u2019s the last joke of the episode.\u201dBoJack brushes her off and finds Charlotte out back. He tries to talk her into abandoning her family for him. Charlotte tells BoJack he has to leave, not because she is angry but because he makes her too sad. \u201cYou think she says go because he\u2019s messing up her life,\u201d Bob-Waksberg told me. \u201cBut then she goes to this other, existential place \u2014 that\u2019s such a broader critique of BoJack.\u201dBoJack retreats to his boat and finds Penny waiting for him. The camera captures Penny loosening his tie when Charlotte walks in.\u201cIf you are not out of my driveway in 30 minutes, I will call the police. And if you ever try to contact me or my family again, I will [expletive] kill you.\u201d Freeze the frame and you have a still of modern parental horror. The next shot is of BoJack and his boat being towed back to Los Angeles.\u201cIn the writing of it, but then again in the animation of it, in the editing of it, we were really specific about what we were seeing,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said. \u201cOriginally Penny\u2019s top was down, and then it was like, No, that\u2019s too much. Let\u2019s reel back a little bit.\u201dI mentioned that despite the anguish of the episode you never see BoJack wrestle with the gravity of his actions \u2014 there\u2019s no classic moment of \u201cMy God, what have I done?\u201d\u201cWell, his whole life is one nervous breakdown,\u201d Bob-Waksberg said.Someone turned on the lights, and we walked into the studio where dozens of staff members were working. Bob-Waksberg shook his head. \u201cI need some sunlight.\u201dWhen I brought up his speech about the elusive pursuit of happiness in \u201cThe Exquisite Corpse Project,\u201d he grimaced. \u201cI thought that was so cutting-edge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was on top of my mind, and I still haven\u2019t gotten over that hill.\u201dA few years ago, someone posted on Craigs\u00adlist a missed connection that briefly went viral. A young man on a train spies a beautiful woman in glasses. Their eyes meet, but they say nothing, both missing their stops. This goes on for a very long time.\u201cFor months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of Skittles sold to us by kids raising money for their basketball teams. We must have heard a million mariachi bands, had our faces nearly kicked in by 100,000 break dancers. I gave money to the beggars until I ran out of singles. When the train went above\u00adground, I\u2019d get text messages and voice mails (\u2018Where are you? What happened? Are you O.K.?\u2019) until my phone ran out of battery.\u201dSixty years pass. There are meaningful glances, but the man says nothing. Finally, the now-elderly woman gets off the train; the now-old man stays on and never verbalizes his love.\u201cAnd I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for 60 years and yet still not really know that person at all. I stayed on the train until it got to Union Square, at which point I got off and transferred to the L.\u201dBob-Waksberg never took credit for the post, although it was eventually traced to him via an anonymous tip. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to just put art out there and watch and see what happens,\u201d he said over lunch at the observatory. He paused to shake the hand of a Dutch tourist who heard us talking about \u201cBoJack\u201d and came over to offer congratulations. \u201cAnd then it is gone. Things don\u2019t have to last forever.\u201dWe gathered our things and tossed them in the recycling. Bob-Waksberg turned to me to make one thing perfectly clear: He has a girlfriend.\u201cIt is going well.\u201dHe paused.\u201cI think.\u201dA few months later, he emailed me.\u201cCan I update that?

{"Headline": "Ending the Ramadan Fast With an Indonesian Feast", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byBOSTON \u2014 Close to Logan International Airport, in a green corner of East Boston, passers-by slow down to catch the drifting smells from Retno Pratiwi\u2019s kitchen. The air is sweet with fresh lemongrass and galangal, with garlic cloves and candlenuts browning slowly in coconut oil.It is nearly the end of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which Muslims around the world fast daily, from sunup to sundown. Ms. Pratiwi, 31, zooms through her kitchen in flip-flops, back and forth between her flat stone mortar and electric stove, putting together an elaborate Indonesian-style feast \u2014 the kind her mother used to prepare on special occasions such as Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that signifies the end of Ramadan.This year, Eid al-Fitr (also called Idul Fitri in Indonesia) begins on Wednesday and can last several days, depending on where it\u2019s celebrated.As with most holidays, there are as many ways to celebrate it as there are families. Many will give generously to charity, exchange gifts and visit relatives. Children will say their prayers in new outfits. And across the world, whether with biryani, borek or sugar-dusted sweets, millions will feast.Slabs of beef are stewed for hours with aromatics and the sweet Indonesian soy sauce called kecap manis. The semur is made the way Ms. Pratiwi\u2019s grandmother and mother taught her to make it, though Ms. Pratiwi braises the beef more gently, in the oven, until it\u2019s very tender and glistening all over with a dark, mellow sauce.Ms. Pratiwi works on a batch of fresh sambal \u2014 a delicious Indonesian hot sauce that packs heat and flavor in equal parts \u2014 momentarily prickling the air when the pur\u00e9e of bird\u2019s-eye chiles starts to simmer and releases steam. But some of the work is already done: In a cupboard full of colorful mismatched plateware, she has been fermenting black rice in a jar for four days, transforming it into a floral, fruity dessert she will serve over ice cubes.Though Ms. Pratiwi was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, like many from the country she and her extended family traveled to their home village for holidays like Idul Fitri. Big celebrations called for luxurious meals with meat and seafood, so a few families in her village, Pandeglang, West Java, might go in on a buffalo and split the meat.Still, the leftovers when Ms. Pratiwi\u2019s mother cooked would be substantial. \u201cMy whole family came over, and we ate this food for days,\u201d Ms. Pratiwi said.She had been helping her mother and grandmother in the kitchen since she was a child, and started to cook professionally after she moved to the United States in 2010, signing up for work as a private chef through Kitchensurfing. Her remarkable Indonesian cooking soon developed a cult following of Dutch expats, Indonesian college students, fellow cooks and regular old food nerds.\u201cDo you like stinky beans?\u201d Ms. Pratiwi asked, turning out a can of slippery petai beans into a spitting-hot pool of coconut oil. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get fresh ones, but these are fine.\u201dRecreating the taste of home is never easy, and when it comes to the recipes Ms. Pratiwi likes to make, finding the right ingredients can be half the challenge. Fresh lemongrass and galangal, which are essential to building Indonesian flavors, are not always available in American supermarkets. Salam leaves, a type of Indonesian bay leaf, can be tricky to find, and despite the name, Ms. Pratiwi said they were absolutely not interchangeable with bay leaves.\u201cIf you can\u2019t find them,\u201d she said, \u201cleave them out.\u201dLikewise, there is no replacement for kaempferia galanga root, a shockingly bright, almost antiseptic-smelling rhizome that awakens the base for opor ayam \u2014 chicken simmered in coconut milk, with knots of lemongrass and bashed ginger, which Ms. Pratiwi\u2019s family always eats on special occasions. Recently, a friend traveling from the Netherlands smuggled some in for Ms. Pratiwi, but the chef usually hydrates a dry version she can get at her local Chinese grocery store.\u201cWe go to New York to get the really hard-to-find ingredients, like candlenuts,\u201d said Ms. Pratiwi, referring to the oily macadamia-like nut. \u201cAnd sometimes we just order stuff on Amazon.\u201dIn western Massachusetts, Mr. Gelling found a turmeric grower selling the roots and discarding the leaves that Ms. Pratiwi needed, but the source didn\u2019t last long. Though the couple tended to their own lime plants in the back garden, as Kaki Lima grew more popular and catered to groups of up to 100 diners, they found that their plants couldn\u2019t keep up with demand.Ms. Pratiwi and Mr. Gelling have set up Kaki Lima in an Australian pie shop in the Boston Shipyard, a Thai restaurant in Austin, Tex., and a modern Asian restaurant in Portland, Me. Next year, they plan to get out of the pop-up game and open a full-time restaurant here.Back in her home kitchen, as the bright red oil begins to draw away from the sambal, Ms. Pratiwi adds raw shrimp and potatoes that Mr. Gelling cooked earlier, according to her specifications. By this time, the chicken is tender, and the candlenuts have done their work of thickening the sauce in the opor ayam.Everything is served at once with sliced ketupat, the firm, sticky rice cake traditionally wrapped in coconut leaves and boiled in water. But Ms. Pratiwi couldn\u2019t find coconut leaves. \u201cSo I used a plastic baggie and sealed it with a candle flame,\u201d she says, holding it up.\u201cBut is it going to be enough rice?\u201d Mr. Gelling asks. \u201cI\u2019m worried it\u2019s not going to be enough rice.\u201dIt\u2019s enough. It\u2019s more than enough. Later, after their friends have gone back for seconds, thirds and possibly fourths, Ms. Pratiwi gives everyone quart containers so that they can pack up some extra food to take home.She cooked the rice in a makeshift bag, but this meal will feed everyone again tomorrow, just as it used to in Pandeglang, when Ms. Pratiwi went home to feast with her family.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Companies Like Dollar Shave Club Are Reshaping the Retail Landscape", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThe world might be a mess, but look on the bright side: Men\u2019s shaving products are much better than they used to be.This column usually focuses on the technology industry, an area that sounds far removed from shaving. But the Dollar Shave acquisition signals something bigger than a mere improvement in shaving \u2014 it also underscores a consumer products revolution that would not have been possible without technology.For you and me, this is a boon. By cutting out the inefficiencies of retail space and the marketing expense of TV, the new companies can offer better products at lower prices. We will get a wider range of products \u2014 if companies don\u2019t have to market a single brand to everyone on TV, they can create a variety of items aimed at blocs of consumers who were previously left behind. And because these companies were born online, where reputations live and die on word of mouth, they are likely to offer friendlier, more responsive customer service than their faceless offline counterparts.With Casper, you simply buy the mattress online and it\u2019s shipped to you in a comically small box (the compressed foam expands into a full-sized mattress, like a magic trick). You have three months to try it out, and if you don\u2019t like it, the company will come pick it up free.Casper\u2019s business model offers a break from the annoyance of offline mattress shopping. It also works out for the company. Casper advertises on social networks, on Google, podcasts and a variety of other places online; the ads are creative, convincing, targeted and cheap. By selling directly rather than through retail middlemen, the company also creates a connection with customers that allows it to test and develop new products \u2014 it now sells sheets and pillows, too.Value destruction could be on the table. But there\u2019s another view that new online brands could unlock profits through products aimed at people who are not well served by incumbents.Unlike Dollar Shave, Mr. Walker does not aim to compete with traditional consumer product companies on price alone. \u201cWe want to build a very profitable business,\u201d he said. He will do so, he said, by fostering a deep, lifelong connection with an audience that is getting wealthier and more influential \u2014 and whose influence, thanks to social networks, can now be tapped.\u201cGlobal culture is led by American culture, which is led by black culture in the U.S. \u2014 look at music, dance, et cetera,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re catering to an audience that are the most culturally influential demographic group in the world, we can use the internet to promulgate our message across the board, whether it\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram \u2014 and that gives us amazing leverage.\u201dWalker & Company declined to provide sales numbers; a spokesman said revenue had grown 300 percent over the last year.\u201cWe\u2019re offering a solution to busy parents that\u2019s just not out there in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Carbonell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about some new style every day, it\u2019s something you can count on.\u201dIt\u2019s striking how few of these online companies could have taken off in the presocial age. At the very least, they would have been sunk by the inability to target ads to the demographics they\u2019re aiming to serve.\u201cLook at Dollar Shave,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads and business platform, told me. \u201cThey were just trying to reach men. If they\u2019d started advertising on TV, they definitely would have wasted half their money.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the job title of Andrew Bosworth at Facebook.

{"Headline": "Cynthia Ozick Takes Up Arms Against Today\u2019s Literary Scene", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cIf an essay has a \u2018motive,\u2019\u200a\u201d Cynthia Ozick once wrote, \u201cit is linked more to happenstance and opportunity than to the driven will. A genuine essay is not a doctrinaire tract or a propaganda effort or a broadside. .\u2008.\u2008. It is a stroll through someone\u2019s mazy mind. .\u2008.\u2008. It co-opts agreement; it courts agreement; it seduces agreement.\u201dOzick doesn\u2019t write tracts, but the characteristic tone of her essays is rather less genial and meandering \u2014 rather more combative and purposeful \u2014 than this description might lead one to suppose. The theme that loosely binds the pieces in her latest collection, \u201cCritics, Monsters, Fanatics, and Other Literary Essays,\u201d is the essential importance \u2014 the cultural necessity \u2014 of literary criticism. In the past, Ozick has been much concerned with the decline of reading, and what it might mean for the fate of the novel. But these days, as she explains in the first essay here, she is more sanguine about the novel\u2019s prospects. Novel writing, she has decided, is \u201can independent art\u201d: Great writers will always write, regardless of dwindling readerships and sales. Now, her more pressing concern is the decline of \u201csuperior\u201d criticism and the absence of the sort of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d that sustained and enlivened American literary culture in the middle of the last century.Critics, she warns, are not to be confused with reviewers, whose ubiquitous productions merely \u201csimulate the skin of a genuine literary culture \u2014 rather like those plastic faux-alligator bags sold everywhere, which can almost pass for the real thing.\u201d Critics are to reviewers as string theorists are to bookkeepers. They call on \u201chorizonless freedoms, multiple histories, multiple libraries, multiple metaphysics and intuitions\u201d to show us how individual novels \u201care connected, what they portend in the aggregate, how they comprise and color an era.\u201d A few such writers are still being regularly published. (She cites James Wood, Adam Kirsch and Daniel Mendelsohn as an exemplary triad.) But many, many more are required, she insists, to make up \u201ca serious and sustained critical surround.\u201dIn a benighted era in which \u201cshallower digital venues proliferate,\u201d the chances of achieving this may seem slim, she observes. Yet \u201clarge projects do not relate to chance. .\u2008.\u2008. They germinate out of necessity and will.\u201d In other words, it is possible for the small, but doughty, band of people who still care about literature to will a new culture of superior criticism into being.One\u2019s faith in Ozick\u2019s \u201clarge project\u201d depends mainly on how willing one is to join her in grandly ignoring the exigencies of the marketplace. The literary novel may be an independent art, but long-form, highbrow criticism is surely rather less so: The amount of such writing that is being published at any given time relates less to necessity and will than to the number of readers prepared to pay for it (or to the number of patrons willing to subsidize it). And much as we might wish it were otherwise, it\u2019s safe to say that the current supply of superior criticism is more or less commensurate with public demand.More troubling than Ozick\u2019s indifference to these bothersome facts is the aggressive snootiness of her tone. Few are likely to disagree with her about the qualitative difference between an essay by James Wood and a newspaper review. Many might even share her nostalgia for the heady days when Alfred Kazin and Lionel Trilling and Irving Howe bestrode the cultural landscape. But there is something unseemly and excessive about the energy she expends on delineating what she finds vulgar and unsatisfactory in the current literary scene.Publishers, she tells us, are mostly \u00adcommerce-minded dullards who favor treacly nonsense over \u201cthe real right thing.\u201d Online reviews are \u201cmostly random and trivial and shrunk to fit the \u00adhither-and-yon notice of cafeteria-style readers.\u201d (Are \u201ccafeteria-style readers\u201d people who read in cafeterias? Or people who graze literary offerings as if they were snacks? No matter, we get the drift.) Even the \u201cunlettered exhibitionists\u201d who post reviews on Amazon and the innocent \u201camateurs\u201d who attend book clubs to kibitz about \u201cbest sellers\u201d do not escape Ozick\u2019s furious condescension. As far as I know, no one has ever proposed that book clubs or BuzzFeed fill the vacuum left by Partisan Review. Why break these butterflies upon her wheel?Ozick has always been a great guardian of distinctions \u2014 between the major and the minor, the high and the low. Her fear is that our ability to make such distinctions is rapidly eroding, that we are in danger of forgetting why Henry James is better than comic books, or why Austen\u2019s novels do not belong in the same realm as chick lit. She is a subtle reader and persuasive champion of the aristocrats of her cultural hierarchy. The essays in this collection that discuss the work of Bellow, Kafka, Trilling, Malamud, are all shrewd and engrossing and eminently capable of seducing the reader\u2019s agreement. (Her attack on the twin fallacies of the \u201cKafkaesque\u201d and of Kafka\u2019s \u201ctranscendence\u201d of his Jewishness should be required reading for all literature students.)But her zealous efforts to put lesser talents and lower forms in their place are rarely so edifying. Rather like the watchful snobbery of Mr. Collins in \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d her relentless policing of the literary ranking system tends only to point up the insecurity of the class order it seeks to defend. One of the distinctions she guards most anxiously is between the eremitic dedication of the true writer (for whom art is a great and necessarily lonely vocation) and the worldliness of the fake writer (who yearns for success, audi\u00adences, fame). She alludes to this distinction in her essay on criticism, when she chastises Jonathan Franzen for having admitted, 20 years ago, in his pre-\u00ad\u201cCorrections\u201d days, that he wanted to \u201cescape from the confinements of a small readership.\u201d (The rebuke to this base ambition is to quote Lionel Trilling\u2019s injunction that a writer must \u201cdirect his words to his spiritual ancestors, or to posterity, or even, if need be, to a coterie.\u201d) She returns to it again in an essay about the necessary \u201cinvisibility\u201d of the novelist. A proper writer, she explains, seeks not \u201cclamorous Fame\u201d but the \u201csimpler, quieter and more enduring\u201d reward of recognition.In truth, the line that separates the desire for recognition and the less noble sorts of aspiration is often blurry \u2014 as Ozick herself is prepared, in her less censorious moments, to admit. She has written feelingly in the past about the anguish, the pangs of professional envy that are wont to beset an obscure writer. As someone who did not publish her first novel until she was in her late 30s, she knows something about these darker, less respectable aspects of writerly ambition. And yet that knowledge tends to produce not sympathy or fellow feeling for those similarly corrupted, but an exaggerated contempt. These days, like Franzen, she enjoys enormous success: a long backlist, critical respect, many awards. Given this, you\u2019d think she could afford to be a little more generous.Zo\u00eb Heller is the author of the novel \u201cThe Believers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Keeper\u2019 Reveals the Passion for Collecting", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewSome of these things are custom-made, others found. Often small items fuse to create larger ones, or installations, which are all, potentially, still growing. Generally speaking, the line between controlled selection and untrammeled accretion is tenuous, as is any clear distinction between connoisseurship and pathology.What is it with the relationship between people and things, anyway \u2014 this human drive to have more and more? Collecting can, of course, be practical: Libraries and museums are valuable utilities. Ego, personal and political, is a familiar motivator: I own much, therefore I am much. So is inertia: In a global capitalist culture, excess stuff arrives all but unbidden and then proves almost impossible to unload.The real point of collecting, though, may lie beyond practicality, or desire, or accident. People surround themselves with things to compensate for perceived deprivation past, and as a hedge against fear of future want. They encase themselves in environments that will magnify their view of themselves in the world or protectively narrow it, and, either way, keep thoughts of dissolution at bay.Wilson Bentley (1865-1931), an American farmer with an inventor\u2019s instincts, spent his life in the town of Jericho, Vt. There, during deep-freeze winters, he created a microscopic technique for photographing snowflakes. After taking some 5,000 pictures, he could assert with confidence that no two snow crystals are alike. The Wisconsin whittler Levi Fisher Ames (1843-1923) might have said the same of the creatures in his miniature wood-carved zoo. His bears, pigs and whales were common enough. But his \u201cRing Tailed Doodle Sockdologer\u201d and his \u201cFamous Michigan Mermaid. Half Elephant and Half Sturgeon\u201d were singular beings, and collectible for that reason alone.Artists with sociological interests also produced voluminous archives of visual data. In 1978, at 67, the Ukraine-born photographer Zofia Rydet set out to document every household in Poland, where she lived. Although by the time of her death, in 1997, she hadn\u2019t reached her goal, she had made an impressive start, shooting the interiors of 20,000 rural homes. Most, however poor, were packed to the roof with things, their walls plastered with images of pop stars and Christian saints.Documenting \u2014 which is a version of collecting \u2014 existing collections like these constitutes a genre of its own in the show. In a 2013 video called \u201cThe Trick Brain,\u201d the contemporary British artist Ed Atkins adds terrifically creepy spoken commentary to an old film tour of the personal art collection amassed by the French Surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton. Beginning in 2005, the Swiss photographer Mario Del Curto began to photograph the astonishing architectural structures by the Canadian artist Richard Greaves on a patch of woodland in southern Quebec, each an immense assemblage of discarded matter held together by wire, and all now destroyed.And in 1993, the Austrian artist Oliver Croy and the critic Oliver Elser rescued almost 400 tabletop-scale models of imaginary Swiss buildings from junk shop oblivion. They were all made from cardboard, matchboxes and magazine tear sheets, by one Peter Fritz (1916-1992), an insurance clerk from Vienna about whom nothing further is known. A sampling of the Fritz collection \u2014 or is it the Croy and Elser collection? The show deliberately confuses the roles of collectors and artists \u2014 is at the New Museum. A group was also included in the main exhibition of the 2013 Venice Biennale, \u201cThe Encyclopedic Palace,\u201d organized by Mr. Gioni. Approximately a third of the participants in \u201cThe Keeper\u201d were also in that Venice show.The Danish artist Henrik Oleson was, too, though he\u2019s at the New Museum with different work, his 2007 survey piece called \u201cSome Gay-Lesbian Artists and/or Artists relevant to Homo-Social Culture Born between c. 1300-1870.\u201d A maze of funky digital prints attached to panels, it approaches art history through a queer eye, dividing it taxonomically by such categories as \u201cThe Appearance of Sodomites in Visual Culture,\u201d \u201cFemale Societies, Amazons, Myths\u201d and \u201cSome Faggy Gestures.\u201d It\u2019s no-such-thing-as-too-much-information brilliant.It\u2019s also quite personal, as the most absorbing work in the show is. Some of it has a reliquary air. Howard Fried, a California-based Conceptualist, exhibits the wardrobe of his mother, who died in 2002. The dark, fetid-looking assemblages of the reclusive Hannelore Baron (1926-1987) were made in the security of her Riverdale, Bronx, home but are saturated with a sense of panicked fatalism instilled by the Holocaust, which she had narrowly escaped.That event is the subject of the show\u2019s single most piercing entry: reproductions of pocket-size pencil drawings, probably dating from 1943, that are eyewitness depictions of the daily horrors of life inside Auschwitz, as recorded by an artist who signed the pictures MM. (The original sheets, found stuffed in a bottle, are in the collection of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.)\u201cEstrela de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o\u201d by Arthur Bispo do Ros\u00e1rio.What emotions propelled that artist\u2019s hand? Fury? Despair? A spirit-focusing, nerve-steadying desire to deliver truth to history? We can\u2019t know. Spiritual love was the force behind the work of the Swedish mystic Hilma af Klint (1862-1944), whose 16 paintings here are the largest number I\u2019ve ever seen in New York, and are alone worth a visit. Her mind was on history, too. She asked that her paintings be hidden away for 20 years after her death, by which time, she hoped, a new age would have the eyes for them. It did.But if she had not lived a middle-class life and been academically trained, would her paintings now be slotted as \u201coutsider art\u201d rather than classic early Modern abstraction? As it is, the outsider label hovers uncertainly over the Berlin artist Vanda Vieira-Schmidt, who turns out streams of abstract drawings, sometimes hundreds a day \u2014 300,000 are stacked in a gallery here \u2014 in the belief that they prevent evil from destroying the world.And the label falls squarely on the career of Arthur Bispo do Ros\u00e1rio (circa 1910-89), a Brazilian artist who, after reporting that he\u2019d had a visit from Christ and some angels, was committed to an asylum where, using unraveled clothing and rubbish, he created tapestries, arklike ships and a line of celestial formal wear, all on view in the museum\u2019s lobby gallery.Yet art isn\u2019t outsider just because it looks that way. If that were true, the market would have long ago jumped on Shinro Ohtake, a highly regarded Tokyo noise-rock musician, who has for decades been compiling cut-and-paste scrapbooks that suggest bulging, eruptive crosses between Rauschenberg \u201ccombines\u201d and Warhol \u201ctime capsules.\u201dYuji Agematsu, his contemporary, would be a big outsider name, too. A New York City resident since 1980, he sifts bits of organic matter from the streets \u2014 cigarette butts, chewed gum, pins \u2014 and encloses them in tiny cellophane wrappers. The results, which resemble mini-terrariums or museum vitrines, do the heroic job of preserving a culture\u2019s base matter but are as portable and personal as talismans.As to the view of art\u2019s being essentially talismanic, there\u2019s a museum-within-the-museum devoted to the idea here, in the form of an installation called \u201cPartners (the Teddy Bear Project)\u201d by the German artist Ydessa Hendeles. Designed as an insanely neat, claustrophobically dense ethnological display on two levels, it holds some 3,000 framed photographs, many from early-20th-century family albums, of people and teddy bears posed together, and a few vintage examples of the real thing.The teddy bear was introduced to America around 1902 \u2014 Germany also lays claim to inventing it \u2014 as a homage to President Theodore Roosevelt and quickly assumed an independent pop-cultural life. Ms. Hendeles, multitasking as artist, curator and collector, has arranged her pictures in units of classification to illustrate some of the toy\u2019s social uses: political mascot, emblem of class status, embodiment of commercial success, protector of childhood innocence, adult comforter in a harsh universe. (Ms. Hendeles is a child of Holocaust survivors who lost everything in World War II.)As an object, single or multiplied, it serves the basic function that collecting \u2014 call it hoarding, call it installation art \u2014 does. It lets us keep the illusion that we can forever embrace, and be embraced by, what is forever fading away.\u201cThe Keeper\u201d continues through Sept. 25 at the New Museum, 235 Bowery, Manhattan; 212-219-1222, newmuseum.orgAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.A big part of what has made Amazon\u2019s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon\u2019s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers \u2014 the warehouses from which it processes customer orders \u2014 in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year.Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon.\u201cI would not take our financial results as an indication we\u2019re running out of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to really prove out their profitability,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Amazon\u2019s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results.The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business.The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing.Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google.Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company\u2019s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.The company\u2019s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\u201cThey are defying the laws of gravity,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt shows their level of market share gains is increasing.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings misstated the number of consecutive quarters in which Amazon has shown a record profit. It is three, not two.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Community-Supported Agriculture Is Not What It Seems", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byAlthough both companies use the term \u201cC.S.A.,\u201d community-supported agriculture, to describe their service, the presence of a middleman between the farmer and the customer is precisely what traditional C.S.A.s are designed to avoid. And since olives and oranges do not grow in this region, those products provide no direct income to local farmers, precisely the people the C.S.A. was invented to benefit.Community-supported agriculture was originally defined by a very particular relationship between a farm and its customers. Starting in the 1980s (earlier in Europe and Japan), members banded together to support a nearby farm with an upfront financial commitment to buy its produce.It was a private transaction in which all the money went directly to the farmer. It did not rely on distributors or brick-and-mortar stores, and it gave farmers a crucial infusion of cash for the winter, used to buy seeds, repair equipment and expand into new growing methods.The goal was for C.S.A. farmers and members to build a mutually supportive long-term relationship. Members would get straight-from-the-farm produce from a farmer they knew and trusted, and farmers would get financial stability.What to consider before joining a farm share or community-supported agriculture group.As the \u201cfarm share\u201d concept has spread, the C.S.A. has become just another part of the sprawling, messy modern system of knowing where your food comes from and choosing what you want to eat.The opportunity for confusion is of enormous concern to many farmers in the New York region. Depending on how and where these new businesses buy their produce, consumers can receive all the benefits of C.S.A. membership, while the farmers get only a fraction. Some farmers say that after years of steady growth, their C.S.A. memberships have dropped since the arrival of services like Local Roots or Farmigo.But the drawbacks can outweigh the benefits. Some say that these hubs have siphoned off their members, partly by offering a more convenient product, but also by blurring the definition of terms like \u201cC.S.A.\u201d and \u201cfarm share,\u201d so that customers believe they are directly supporting local farms with their purchases when they might not.\u201cDo consumers even know that when they sign up for one of these fake C.S.A.s, sometimes it doesn\u2019t benefit local farmers any more than if they shop at the supermarket?\u201d Ms. Kaplan-Walbrecht asked.Probably not. The organic farm boxes you buy online may or may not be local. Local farm boxes may or may not be organic. The farmers may or may not be paid more than wholesale prices. And customers may or may not care.\u201cI just assume that if it\u2019s organic, it\u2019s good,\u201d said Raquel Hoffman, a C.S.A. member in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. \u201cI can\u2019t also worry about whether it\u2019s local, or whether the chickens were happy, and all that.\u201dTaking the time to tease out whether buying granola made in Brooklyn qualifies as supporting local agriculture can test the patience of consumers. Services like Local Roots offer an alluring simplicity.\u201cIf the goal is to make local food accessible, we need to make shopping for it as much like a one-stop shop as possible,\u201d said Wen-Jay Ying, who founded Local Roots NYC. \u201cPeople who care about local produce are also going to care about great olive oil, so I\u2019m going to connect them to great olive oil. And that money comes back to support the local food movement, including farmers.\u201dMs. Ying said that the more food options her customers have, the more likely they are to remain in the C.S.A., which in turn sustains the 15 local farms from which Local Roots buys. Traditional C.S.A.s have a high turnover rate; many people simply find the system too inflexible for their needs.\u201cIf we want the local food system to grow, we all have to grow and evolve with it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re stubborn against the change, it\u2019s only going to hurt the local food movement.\u201dEric Stone, who oversees C.S.A.s at FreshDirect, said he believed that widening distribution and raising visibility for local produce \u2014 as the company\u2019s boxes do \u2014 benefit local agriculture in the long term. Hepworth Farms, in the Hudson Valley, packs C.S.A. boxes for FreshDirect customers that are stamped with the farm\u2019s own name and logo. \u201cI really think it gives them a chance to get their stuff out there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt expands the whole market.\u201dHepworth is an example of an organic farm that benefits from increased options for farmers, participating in a new distribution system alongside its farmers\u2019 market, restaurant and wholesale businesses.Now that local food has become big business, Target and Walmart are trying to get a piece of it, and even Amazon is delivering locally grown kale. This new demand has been a boon for many farmers across the country, especially large-scale farmers equipped to sell in bulk; new sales channels have been opened that they could never have accessed independently.Small farmers say they have no problem with new markets for local food; they just don\u2019t want them to be called C.S.A.s.\u201cThe C.S.A. system was developed for consumers and for small farmers,\u201d Ms. Lukats said. \u201cThe win-win was low prices and guaranteed income. Anything you put in the middle of that raises the prices for the consumer or takes away money from the farmer.\u201dBut in interviews with farmers, policy makers and entrepreneurs, all parties agreed that for fragile local food systems to strengthen, consumers will have to be offered more choice and control over what they eat than is possible with a traditional C.S.A.Ben Shute of Hearty Roots said that there are financial risks for farmers in working through middlemen, and they are precisely the risks that C.S.A.s were designed to eliminate. \u201cSome of them want to have real relationships with farmers, but some are shopping around for the best price,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a farmer is growing a certain crop for them, and then they go elsewhere, what is that farmer supposed to do? The product is perishable. Its value has a short life span.\u201dSome of them have proved to have a short life span. In 2015, Good Eggs suddenly ended deliveries in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and New Orleans after just one year; Farmstr, started with much fanfare in Seattle in 2013, also closed up shop in 2015.And in just the last two weeks, 15,000 households in New York, New Jersey, Seattle and Northern California that subscribed to C.S.A.s through a company called Farmigo received boxes that would be their last, as the company abruptly shut down its food distribution operation \u2014 in the middle of the harvest season \u2014 to return to its core business: software.Farmigo, which started deliveries in 2013, fueled its rapid expansion with more than $25 million of venture capital, raised on the strength of a food distribution software platform that the founder, Benzi Ronen, claimed would eventually replace supermarkets altogether.Mr. Ronen said that was still inevitable. \u201cI never saw a conflict with the C.S.A.s,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw a lot of customers leaving C.S.A.s because they wanted a more traditional market. So we built an online farmers\u2019 market with 700 items.\u201dBut the real-world logistics of washing, packing, refrigerating, distributing and delivering those items to 400 locations proved overwhelming. So Farmigo members lost out on this growing season, and scores of Farmigo farmers were left with fields and trailers full of unsold produce.Still, Mr. Ronen said he did not believe that traditional C.S.A.s are the answer.\u201cI started as a local-farming fanatic, all the way at the end of the spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that if we want to grow the number of people who have access to this food, there have to be many approaches.\u201dcookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

It will also test whether a single operator can safely command multiple drones at once, as well as technology that lets the machines automatically detect and avoid other planes, buildings and people.Mr. Bezos has since pointed to regulation as the biggest obstacle to the delivery of small packages by drones. The Seattle company has grown increasingly frustrated with the F.A.A.\u2019s cautious approach to its plans. Mr. Misener said in a Senate hearing in March 2015 that by the time regulators approved limited testing for certain Amazon drone models, those machines were already obsolete.Amazon has since moved more research and development of its drones to Britain, Canada and the Netherlands; the company views its partnership with Britain as its most advanced. The Civil Aviation Authority \u2014 the British equivalent of the F.A.A. \u2014 said it may also enter into similar partnerships with other commercial drone makers.\u201cWe want to enable the innovation that arises from the development of drone technology by safely integrating drones into the overall aviation system,\u201d said Tim Johnson, policy director of the Civil Aviation Authority. \u201cThese tests by Amazon will help inform our policy and future approach.\u201dUnited States regulators have been reluctant to permit drone delivery because of safety concerns. Amazon wants to be able to fly its drones at night and miles beyond the sight of operators. The company said it has developed \u201csense and avoid\u201d technology to prevent collisions, which it has not been able to broadly test in the United States.Amazon said it does not plan to decrease its drone investments in the United States and will continue to push for F.A.A. approval. Aviation analysts predict the United States will eventually permit drone delivery, but not in the next year or two.\u201cThe concern is that companies will significantly shift their drone testing or implementation programs to other countries,\u201d said Michael Sievers, co-chairman of the Unmanned Systems Group at Hunton & Williams, a law firm based in Richmond, Va. \u201cThis is more likely the case for near-term testing, but even then the effect is likely limited, as there is a cost to such relocations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crash Course in Honeymoon Survival", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byModern LoveI married a brawny Canadian, an amateur naturalist with an adventurous spirit disguised by a law degree and a 9-to-9 job in Times Square. Early in our relationship, I caught a glimpse behind this facade when I found his iPhone filled with close-up photos of bizarre insects and obscure reptiles. Later, I discovered his recent Google searches included \u201cwhite capuchin monkey howl\u201d and \u201ctardigrade mating habits.\u201dOur honeymoon began with a three-day camping trip in the Amazon rain forest. Jeremy booked the expedition through a lodge outside Iquitos, Peru, the only tour operator he could find that offered overnight stays in the open jungle. I agreed because it would be an opportunity to see Jeremy in remote wilderness, his most beloved environment. It would be like visiting his hometown together for the first time.We flew to Lima and then Iquitos, where we met our guide and traveled with him by boat to a small inlet along the Amazon River. The dilapidated lodge stood partly submerged, victim to the season\u2019s unusually fierce flooding.The rising water had washed away our trekking path, too. At Jeremy\u2019s insistence, the lodge hired a local trapper, Arnold, to lead us through uncharted territory with the lodge\u2019s own guide and tracker. Arnold lived alone in the jungle for weeks at a time. Towering foliage and oversize insects were his home territory; he would guide us through his backyard.At the outset, you could tell we were amateurs by our Osprey and Kelty backpacks. The lodge\u2019s guide and tracker slung giant potato sacks over their backs, while Arnold carried only a pink polyester girls school bag.I admired Jeremy in his jungle get-up. His dirt-crusted pants were tucked loosely into knee-high rubber boots. I watched the glint of his wedding ring appear and disappear as his hands swayed, a reminder of the lavishly joyous party we had thrown in Boston. Stomping along behind him, I wore a floppy-brimmed navy hat that I intended to look rugged but instead appeared quintessentially \u201cmiddle-age gardener.\u201dAfter five hours of hiking, we arrived at a clearing. Our companions quickly worked their machetes, building a shelter from tree trunks, netting and tarps. It was just enough to protect us from the rain, mosquitoes, bullet ants, scorpions, coral snakes and cacophony of other perilous creatures that fascinated Jeremy and terrified me.The lodge had sent our guides off with minimal rations: a bag of rice, two cans of tuna and a dozen eggs (10 of them broken). To supplement, we set out on an evening hunt. Our guides found a bird sleeping in a tree several meters up, then cut down a second tree and used it to club the bird from its perch. Dinner.Jeremy awoke in the middle of the night to pee. Despite our efforts to keep the mosquito net closed, half the jungle flew in the moment a corner was lifted. Jeremy ducked back, bladder unrelieved, to commence killing the cloud of insects one by one.By the next day, Arnold was lost. To avoid the flooding, we had left the path and followed him into swampy backwoods where each step looked identical to the next.Nearly out of food and dependent on our confused guides for survival, we suggested hacking our way south until we hit the Amazon River. Yet our guides had not packed a compass, and the foliage was too thick to track the sun. Instead, we walked aimlessly as Arnold scoured the undergrowth for remnants of a footpath. There were none.We awoke the next morning to a rifle shot. Arnold dragged a bloody peccary to our campsite. It was an Amazonian wild boar, and like nearly everything in the Amazon, it was larger and more vicious than its North American relative. With precision and a hint of showmanship, Arnold skinned and gutted the 90-pound animal. He cut down large palms and briskly wove them into a backpack, which he stuffed with the dripping meat and strapped to the outside of his girls backpack.The kill caused a split in our ranks. With speed we could not possibly match, Arnold and the tracker pushed ahead, leaving our guide, Jeremy and me with a single machete to bushwhack our path. Our guide shouted ahead before turning heavily to us. \u201cI think they have left us,\u201d he said, \u201cto find a way home before the meat spoils.\u201dAt some point, Jeremy and I would transition in our guide\u2019s mind from clients to baggage. Having grown up in the jungle, he could feed himself for days on plants and rodents, but he could not support the three of us for long.Resigned, we set up camp. I could no longer feign being outdoorsy, so I made the only contribution I could: I became an Amazonian homemaker. I wiped dirt from the tarp, then laid out the flat sheet and ran my hand over the wrinkles. I placed our After Bite at the top and a bottle for urinating at our feet. I put Jeremy\u2019s book on the right and mine on the left, an echo of the sleeping arrangement we developed on our plush Sealy mattress in New York.\u201cAre you scared?\u201d I asked.Jeremy squinted, raising his hand to block the beam of my headlamp. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said. \u201cWorse comes to worst, we get back a few days late and a bit hungry. There\u2019s probably enough information in my book to find edible food.\u201dLying on a tarp in the jungle that night, we felt entirely useless and infantile, unable to eat or walk without a guide. So we stitched together a false reality where we played important roles as comforter and protector, as receiver of comfort and beneficiary of protection.We talked about our lives. At a time when our future felt tenuous, we went ahead and created it, chattering about how many children we would have and what we would teach them. How we would instill a love of adventure and an understanding of the difference between risk and recklessness, something we were just beginning to grasp.\u201cMake me laugh?\u201d I asked.Jeremy folded his wrists back and held them up to his ears. \u201cWho am I?\u201dI giggled, a welcome moment of relief. \u201cThe dog.\u201d\u201cNow your turn,\u201d he said.Outside, we heard a muffled hum in the distance.\u201cA boat!\u201d our guide exclaimed. We could not be more than eight or 10 hours from the Amazon River. Tomorrow, we would follow the sound southward looking for a path to the river. From there, we could find a boat back to the lodge.Come dawn, that\u2019s exactly what we did.Our first step on the dock that evening was joyous. We threw down our packs and muscled off our wet rain boots. We sat in awe and silence and exhaustion until we regained the strength to drag ourselves to the honeymoon suite, a large room that had running water but lacked electricity.We showered. Lying side by side on a lumpy mattress, we counted our bruises. We were safe, together. I had paid my dues for my nature lover of a husband, and we were all the better for it.On the morning of our departure, we opted for one last short trek with our guide. Along the way, he called us over, pointing a stick at a coral snake resting under a large leaf. We crowded around.Jeremy confirmed the beauty of the animal and explained that its poison was neurotoxic. You could die within hours of respiratory arrest as your lungs failed to expand and your major organs wilted from hypoxia. There was a whole section on it in the Roosevelt book.With another poke, the snake lunged at us, lifting most of its body a foot in the air. \u201cRun, run, run!\u201d the guide shouted.The snake slithered away. So did we, first to Iquitos, then to a four-star hotel in Colombia, and finally, armed with our newfound survival skills, into the disorienting wilderness of married life.Sara Manning Peskin is a neurology resident at the University of Pennsylvania and the chief blogger at Borderwise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Races to Catch Up in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byBitsWhen it comes to cloud computing, Google is in a very unfamiliar position: seriously behind.\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest maker of computer servers is making machines just for these guys,\u201d said John Lovelock, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt\u2019s the nexus of things like big data, social networks and mobility, and the next big thing, which is artificial intelligence.\u201dFor Google, a loss in cloud computing would be a rare misstep for a company that revolutionized media with its advertising business, and then made the world\u2019s leading smartphone operating system.A victory for Google, however, could change how we work, turning advanced computing into an everyday utility that we use to run factories, interact in virtual reality or read one another\u2019s emotions. Given Google\u2019s track record, it\u2019s worth considering the prospect.But it will be an uphill climb.Google is moving rapidly to change things. Three announcements it made last week show how it hopes to gain ground on Amazon Web Services and Azure.First, the company said it has used artificial intelligence to cut the power use in its data centers 15 percent, a huge decrease considering how efficient these data factories were already.Power is probably the largest single cost for all three of the cloud companies. Google is almost certain to use its savings to reduce prices, much the way it won in search advertising by figuring out its competitors\u2019 costs, then undercutting them.\u201cThis certainly gives Google an edge,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people focused on narrow problems. We\u2019ve focused on the widest possible problem.\u201dGoogle also released for public use ways to transcribe and analyze recorded speech for things like meaning, emotional content and whether a speaker was happy or sad. An outside company that worked on the project \u2014 Google would not say which one \u2014 used it to analyze over two billion minutes of customer service calls. It works in 80 languages, Google said.At the same time, the company moved its customers on the United States West Coast from a data center in Iowa to facilities in Oregon. Google\u2019s network, which it claims is larger than the internet, can send the equivalent of 375 hours of video a second.A move like that only makes sense when a company wants to offer the kind of split-second performance needed for virtual reality or instantaneous customer interactions over networks of cellphones and sensors.Can faster networks, lower prices and lots of artificial intelligence put Google ahead? Amazon\u2019s lead seems to give it an edge for at least the next couple of years, as its cloud branch has perfected a method of developing hundreds of new cloud features annually. Yet while the company appears to have some basic artificial intelligence features, called machine learning, it seems to have little in the way of speech recognition or translation.Mr. Lovelock, the Gartner analyst, predicted that Google would offer businesses the insights it has gained from years of watching people online. \u201cAmazon views the customer as the person paying the bill, while Google believes the customer is the end user of a service,\u201d he said. And Microsoft is promoting itself as the company that has products customers already know and use.\u201cEveryone has to play to the strengths the market already sees they have,\u201d Mr. Lovelock said.Advertisement"}

Popular shows like \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d \u201cRoots\u2019\u2019 and \u201cFargo\u201d drew attention to the limited series category, James Corden emerged as a force in the late-night competition, and there was recognition in the best drama category for the widely praised but previously overlooked \u201cThe Americans.\u201dHBO, which is coming off its biggest Emmy haul ever last year, had a total of 94 nominations, the highest of any network for the 16th consecutive year.FX\u2019s star-studded limited series \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d and its anthology series \u201cFargo\u201d were the second- and third-most nominated shows. FX finished behind HBO in nominations with 56.The streaming services Netflix and Amazon continue to make significant inroads, with each scoring its highest Emmy nomination totals (54 for Netflix and 16 for Amazon).The broadcast networks are still experiencing a diminished presence at the Emmys, with three of the networks \u2014 ABC, Fox and CBS \u2014 notching fewer nominations than in 2015. NBC had the same total, with 41. And for the fifth consecutive year, the networks were shut out of nominations for best drama.HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep,\u201d which last year ended the five-year winning streak of ABC\u2019s \u201cModern Family\u2019\u2019 in the best comedy category, was once again nominated for that award. It will go up against \u201cModern Family\u201d again, along with Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cblack-ish\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None.\u201dWith Jon Hamm\u2019s Don Draper from \u201cMad Men\u201d out of the race, the best actor category for drama has no clear front-runner. Two previous Emmy winners, Kyle Chandler (\u201cBloodline\u201d) and Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d), will compete against Kevin Spacey (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d), Liev Schreiber (\u201cRay Donovan\u201d), Matthew Rhys (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) and Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d), all of whom are looking for their first Emmy.Viola Davis, who last year became the first African-American woman to win a best acting Emmy in the drama category, will try to repeat, for her performance in \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder.\u201d She is up against Robin Wright (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d), Keri Russell (\u201cThe Americans\u201d), Tatiana Maslany (\u201cOrphan Black\u201d), Claire Danes (\u201cHomeland\u201d) and Taraji P. Henson (\u201cEmpire\u201d). Ms. Russell is the only new actress in the category, and this represents her first Emmy nomination.FX\u2019s Emmy haul was propelled by \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cThe Americans.\u201d\u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d received a whopping six nominations in the limited series acting categories, including one for Sarah Paulson, who was also nominated for her role in FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Hotel.\u201d Ms. Paulson, who portrayed the prosecutor Marcia Clark in \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d said in an interview that she shot both roles at the same time and that she was \u201crunning on fumes, just as Marcia was.\u201dShe added, \u201cI used all of my exhaustion to my benefit since no one was more tired during that trial than Marcia Clark.\u201dAnother standout on Thursday was three-time Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf, who was nominated for three awards: for best actress in a comedy series for HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On\u201d and for guest appearances in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cHorace and Pete.\u201dNetflix had a strong day, with nominations in both the lead drama and comedy categories and in several acting categories. With 54 nominations, Netflix has 20 more than it received last year, its previous record. \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d the popular Netflix documentary, was nominated for six awards, including best documentary series.This is the first year that Netflix eclipsed each of the broadcast networks.Amazon was led by its comedy \u201cTransparent,\u201d which had 10 nominations. Last year, the show\u2019s star, Jeffrey Tambor, won the best actor award, the first time a streaming service had won a lead acting Emmy.For the first time in 16 years, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was not nominated in the best variety show category, a blow to its rookie host, Trevor Noah. Likewise, Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d was snubbed, while Mr. Corden\u2019s \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d was honored instead. The nomination will add fuel to the discussion that Mr. Corden is outshining his more experienced CBS colleague.Rounding out the category were HBO\u2019s John Oliver, ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel, HBO\u2019s Bill Maher, NBC\u2019s Jimmy Fallon and Crackle\u2019s \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d with Jerry Seinfeld.Unlike the Academy Awards, which have overhauled the membership ranks following controversy over its all-white slate of acting nominees, the Emmys have a relatively diverse lineup, with a number of actors of color receiving nominations.In the comedy acting categories, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus is up again for her performance in \u201cVeep.\u201d She has won the award four years in a row (and has seven Emmys over all). She will be competing against Ms. Metcalf, Amy Schumer (\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d), Lily Tomlin (\u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d), Tracee Ellis Ross (\u201cblack-ish\u201d) and Ellie Kemper (\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d).Mr. Tambor will be up against Anthony Anderson (\u201cblack-ish\u201d), Aziz Ansari (\u201cMaster of None\u201d), Will Forte (\u201cThe Last Man on Earth\u201d), William H. Macy (\u201cShameless\u201d) and Thomas Middleditch (\u201cSilcon Valley\u201d).The Emmys will be hosted this year by Mr. Kimmel and will be broadcast on Sept. 18 on ABC.An article on Friday about the Emmy nominations omitted a nominee for best actress in a drama. Besides Viola Davis, Robin Wright, Keri Russell, Tatiana Maslany and Claire Danes, the nominees also included Taraji P. Henson.Jeremy Egner contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Well, for decades they were mandatory \u2014 every community, from a big city down to a tiny village, was required by law to have one.The law was enacted in 1919, soon after Czechoslovakia emerged as an independent country. The idea was to promote universal literacy and education after the country was free of the German-speaking Austro-Hungarian Empire. And it worked.\u201cCzechs developed a strong reading habit, and even today, those who visit libraries buy more books \u2014 11 a year, on average \u2014 than others,\u201d said Vit Richter, director of the Librarianship Institute of the Czech National Library.The library law survived the German occupation, the communist era and even the breakup with Slovakia in the early 1990s. What it couldn\u2019t survive, in the end, was budgetary pressure. To save money, the requirement was dropped in 2001, when there were about 6,019 libraries in the country; since then, about 11 percent have merged or closed.Rather than just linger on as an eccentricity from a bygone age, though, the surviving Czech libraries are doing what they can to stay vibrant and relevant. They serve as polling places for elections and as local meeting venues. They organize reading clubs and art exhibits and offer computer literacy courses, and they welcome droves of schoolchildren and retirees during the day.But mostly, they do what 92 percent of Czechs still want them to go on doing, according to the Gates Foundation survey: They lend books.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the picture caption with this article misidentified the library. It is the library at the Strahov Monastery, not the Czech National Library.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Wins Appeal on Overseas Data Searches", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byFor the last few years, American technology giants have been embroiled in a power struggle with the United States government over when authorities get to see and use the digital data that the companies collect.On Thursday, Microsoft won a surprise victory in one such legal battle against the government over access to data that is stored outside the United States.Had the United States government prevailed, Microsoft and others warned, it would set a dangerous precedent that would make it increasingly difficult to resist orders from foreign courts demanding data, such as email from human rights activists or political dissidents. Corporate and government customers abroad also might be unwilling to use cloud services from Microsoft if they thought their data could be seized by American courts, Microsoft said.The Justice Department, which brought the case, had argued that Microsoft\u2019s status as a company based in the United States gave it authority to obtain its data, even if the data was stored outside the country.On Thursday, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said the court\u2019s ruling was a victory for digital privacy rights. He added that the adoption of cloud services by customers in some countries, especially in the public sector, had slowed as a result of the uncertainty around the privacy of their communications.\u201cWe\u2019ve all been worrying about a lack of confidence that people in other countries had when it came to using U.S. cloud services because of their concern the U.S. government would try to reach into their borders,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is, I think, very important in bolstering confidence for our customers around the world.\u201dThe government is likely to appeal the ruling, legal experts said. In a statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said, \u201cWe are disappointed with the court\u2019s decision and are considering our options.\u201dWhatever path the case ends up taking, Thursday\u2019s decision has big implications for other tech companies like Apple and Amazon, both of which supported Microsoft\u2019s position in the case. The behemoths can use the ruling to argue against future attempts by governments to obtain communications beyond their borders.\u201cThe tech community is breathing a collective sigh of relief,\u201d said Craig A. Newman, a lawyer with Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler. \u201cUntil this ruling, tech companies with data centers outside the U.S. were stuck in this proverbial rock and a hard place.\u201d\u201cThree decades ago, international boundaries were not so routinely crossed as they are today, when service providers rely on worldwide networks of hardware to satisfy users\u2019 21st\u2013century demands for access and speed and their related, evolving expectations of privacy,\u201d the court wrote in its decision.The office of the Irish Data Commissioner, which sets online privacy rules in Ireland, did not respond to a request for comment.Digital rights groups praised the decision and joined Microsoft and other technology companies in calling on Congress to modernize laws on electronic communications.\u201cThis is a significant decision and yet another reminder that the laws that protect our privacy online are dangerously out of date,\u201d said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cAs the concurring opinion points out, our online privacy laws are not the bulwarks of privacy that Congress thought they were when it enacted them in 1986.\u201dThe decision caught some people off guard because earlier rulings by other courts had gone against Microsoft.An earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, the day of the court\u2019s ruling.

Hack Raises a Frightening Question: What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterThere is a Russian word for this practice: \u201ckompromat.\u201d A portmanteau of the Russian words for \u201ccompromising\u201d and \u201cmaterial,\u201d it refers to the timeworn tradition of obtaining information and using it to smear or influence public officials. Unscrupulous Russian politicians have been doing it for decades; there are kompromat websites (which, unsurprisingly, are often blocked or harassed).The way it works is simple. First, Kremlin insiders or other powerful individuals buy, steal or manufacture incriminating information about an opponent, an enemy, or any other person who poses a threat to powerful interests. Then, they publish it, destroying the target\u2019s reputation in order to settle public scores or manipulate public events.If American officials and analysts are correct in their assessment that Russia was behind this spring\u2019s hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, it seems that kompromat is being translated to the international stage.The United States has had plenty of experience with hackers, government and otherwise, but the D.N.C. hack is something new. Rather than using the information seized for intelligence purposes, the hackers selected damaging excerpts from the cache of stolen data, and then leaked them at a pivotal moment in the presidential election.And analysts are worried that such activity could soon become a routine element of geopolitics.\u201cThis is not just about the United States, it is not just about Trump or Clinton, or just about American democracy,\u201d said Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIf they consider this a success, they may conclude that, \u2018Of course, we can do this elsewhere.

We can probably also find things, kompromat, on the next president.\u2019 \u201dThe history of kompromat in Russia shows how damaging this practice can be to democracy and the rule of law.The term may be Russian, but kompromat is not limited to the country\u2019s borders. Chinese officials and businessmen, for instance, have long been rumored to spy on their personal and professional rivals, searching for information that could be used to discredit them.Last week\u2019s leak of data stolen from the Democratic National Committee fits that pattern, only now it is playing out in a new arena \u2014 in an attack by one state against the political system of another.To be sure, history offers numerous examples of countries, including the United States, meddling in one another\u2019s elections. But although the aims may not be new, these technological methods and their potential consequences are.The D.N.C. leak shows that kompromat need not reveal anything illegal to be damaging: The party\u2019s chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to step down after party officials were shown to have taken sides during the primaries. This sets a precedent in which virtually anyone who uses email or social media could be vulnerable to any state or private group with a grudge and access to hackers.The Chinese and Russians are used to these tactics to settle political and business rivalries. The D.N.C. hack, in exporting kompromat abroad, has established a precedent that may tempt other hackers foreign and domestic, state-sponsored and private.Because technology makes hacks easier to start than to counter, the risk is difficult to overcome. And anyone with money or expertise can undertake a hack, particularly against nonstate targets that have weaker security systems, and often with little risk of being caught because the attack can be denied.In the past, he pointed out, someone who wanted to obtain lurid details of an adversary\u2019s sex life would have had to set up a \u201choney trap\u201d operation and then photograph the target in flagrante. \u201cBut now if you break into someone\u2019s email,\u201d Mr. Segal noted, \u201cyou can find a message that \u2018so-and-so is an idiot,\u2019 or their porn history\u201d \u2014 private, personal information that could be tremendously embarrassing or discrediting if released.In that climate, everyone who has something to lose, has enemies, or is a public figure is susceptible to this kind of reputational destruction. The higher a person climbs, the greater the risk becomes \u2014 and the greater temptation to a rival.More attacks may already be on the way. Last year, the federal Office of Personnel Management announced that hackers had breached its computers and stolen vast quantities of data gathered for security clearances and background checks.Mr. Segal said that the stolen data included information on government employees\u2019 sex lives, relationships, finances, contacts with foreign governments and other private details.The data, which goes back to 1985, was gathered so that American counterintelligence officers could assess employees\u2019 vulnerability to blackmail. But that well-intentioned project may have ended up conveniently cataloging their most vulnerable points for the hackers.And on Friday, federal law enforcement officials revealed that computer systems used by the Clinton campaign had also been hacked in an attack that appeared to have come from Russia\u2019s intelligence services.Government offices and political organizations are hardly the only targets.Analysts said hacking is likely to expand in the realm of foreign policy by giving states a new, low-risk method to tweak one another or to meddle in one another\u2019s internal affairs. State-sponsored hacks meant to weaponize information are relatively inexpensive and difficult to defend against, making them a tempting tool.But it is precisely their appeal that gives these tactics the potential to make the international arena more volatile. It is hard to determine responsibility, which creates a risk that states will punish the wrong culprit \u2014 or respond too harshly, forcing an unintended cycle of escalation.Because there are no established norms for what is and is not tolerated in such attacks, or for how a targeted state is expected to respond, even the prospect of this kind of hacking creates dangerous uncertainty.This practice is beyond the reach or enforcement of most laws, and outside the scope of the norms that limit states\u2019 interference in one another\u2019s affairs. And because effective defense is so difficult, it is hard to predict what the limits \u2014 or the consequences \u2014 of that might be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Coolant That Threatens to Heat Up the Climate", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThat reduction may not sound significant, but it is. Without an amendment, there is little doubt the effects would be devastating, although the science of climate change cannot yet pinpoint the precise damage that would occur.It is not hard to imagine scenarios where avoiding or delaying .9\u00b0F of additional warming proves invaluable, especially when paired with further reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. As warming crosses specific temperature thresholds, scientists expect ice sheets to melt and the Amazon rain forest to die off. Tipping points like these could prove irreversible, and eventually lead to famine and several feet of sea-level rise.Dollar for dollar, reducing HFCs offers a huge benefit for little comparative cost. But with so little public attention focused on these negotiations, the danger is that we could end up without an amendment, or one that is not sufficiently ambitious to deal with this threat.The depletion of the ozone represented a tangible danger that people could understand and rally round. Government officials worried that it would lead to increases in skin cancer and cataracts, and the discovery of a growing hole in the ozone layer added urgency. The threat of HFCs, like carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, is more amorphous. The effects of these gases won\u2019t become pronounced for decades.Fortunately, there are alternatives to HFCs. Propane can be used as a coolant in small air-conditioners at a fraction of the climate impact of HFCs, and ammonia is an industrial coolant with no greenhouse effects. Much of the HFC industry welcomes the regulatory certainty that would come with an amendment, and companies stand to benefit from selling new products. Many of these new products are far more energy efficient, which could double the emissions reductions from phasing down HFCs.The primary objection to an ambitious amendment is cost. The total price tag for an HFC phase down is estimated at $8 billion to $10 billion over the next three decades, which works out to 8 or 10 cents on the dollar per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. The Montreal Protocol provides for a fund to help developing countries phase down their use of atmospheric pollutants. Much or all of the money is expected to come from the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Union.Last month, President Obama cleared one of the biggest remaining diplomatic hurdles to an amendment. He secured a vow from India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to support an HFC phase down, though the country\u2019s earlier proposal for a freeze date of 2031 is not nearly aggressive enough. President Xi Jinping of China has also agreed to support a phase down; the country\u2019s proposed timetable is reportedly more aggressive than India\u2019s but slower than what the United States is seeking. Both China and India produce HFCs and use them widely.Often, it is a virtue in foreign policy for negotiations to fly under the radar. The opposite is true in this instance. Lack of attention is the greatest threat to a successful amendment. There is no urgency without attention. A deal can slip out of grasp with few repercussions for failure.Constituents do not throw you out of office for failure to phase down unpronounceable refrigerants. But they should. Without an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol, millions of lives will be measurably worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Spanish Isle of Formentera, the Charms of Italy", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byNext StopThere is an island so perfect \u2014 the skies so blue, the beaches so smooth, the water so tranquil \u2014 that the seaweed off its shores is protected by Unesco. People travel from near and far to lounge on these shores, to swim in these waters, perhaps to break up the day with a plate of fresh fish, still briny from the sea and shiny with olive oil. This island is made for people who embrace the beach like an old friend, for people who would brave hardship for homemade pasta, for people who make vacationing well their life\u2019s mission.This island is made for Italians.But Formentera is, in fact, one of the Balearic Islands of Spain, a good 600 miles from the coast of mainland Italy. It\u2019s also just hard enough to get to (from New York, two planes and a boat) that if you tell someone you\u2019re going there, you\u2019ll most likely need a follow-up line, like, \u201cIt\u2019s in the Mediterranean,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s just below Ibiza.\u201d But it also happens to become, for a few months, the extra-national home of Italian beachgoers. Go there in the summertime, and you will experience a fusion of two of the most sun-and-olive-oil worshiping cultures in Europe: the Italians and the Spanish. Formentera is, I would soon learn, an island given to man-buns, mopeds and melanoma.Don\u2019t be misled by its proximity to Ibiza. While Formentera is only about a dozen miles off the southern coast of that famous celebrity stomping ground, the foam parties and ooonz-ooonz club beats of Ibiza might as well be a million miles away. (In recent years, Formentera has gone so far as to impose major restrictions on night life, limiting how many people can gather in one place and how late a bar can play music.)Like so many summer destinations, Formentera fills to bursting in the warmer months, swelling from 12,500 local inhabitants year-round to over 45,000 in August. Seventy percent of the island is protected from developers, and there hasn\u2019t been a major new hotel structure for 35 years. Said one local, \u201cWe do not want to become Majorca or Ibiza.\u201dThis beautiful, unassuming spit of sand \u2014 about 30 square miles \u2014 is not without a formidable history. Formentera was colonized over 4,000 years ago. It has been occupied by Arabs, Romans, Vandals, Moors, Byzantines and pirates, until it eventually became Spanish territory. During the Spanish Civil War, left-leaning Formentera came under heavy fighting; during that time, the island had a concentration camp for political dissidents. In the 1960s, Formentera became a haven for bohemian Europeans.In the mid-1990s, Italians really took notice of the island. \u201cWe realized we had the Caribbean a couple of hours away from Italy,\u201d Jonathan Di Segni, a native Milanese who has been living in Formentera since 2003, told me when I visited with my family last summer. \u201cOf course, once the Italian football players started coming here, everyone wanted to come.\u201dFormentera has been a favorite destination of Italy\u2019s soccer (a.k.a. football) players for years. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s close to Italy, we love everything about it,\u201d Cristian Brocchi, the coach of AC Milan, told me on the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for 15 years. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s more popular today, but Formentera doesn\u2019t change \u2014 this is the best part about it.\u201d (One Roman woman on the island likened her country\u2019s obsession with their athletes to lemmings: \u201cWe would jump off the cliff right behind them.\u201d)A few days into our trip I had lunch with Claudia Bordino, owner of Casa Y Entorno Inmobiliaria, a local real estate agency. Ms. Bordino, an Italian expat, and I were sharing pizza margherita at Panperfocaccia, an open-air trattoria in the port town of La Savina. \u201cMost Italians take their first vacation in Spain, so it holds a special place in our hearts,\u201d she said. \u201cItalians love the Spanish \u2014 we love the language, we love the culture. And the Spanish love a good party; in that way they are more fun than the French.\u201dThe island itself is mostly sandy, and rocky, with a good portion given over to salt flats. It\u2019s the driest place on earth \u2014 or at least the driest place I\u2019ve ever been. When the kids and I hung out our laundry, dripping wet, in the morning, it was crunchy and stiff in an hour. After a couple of days, my skin felt rougher, and small flecks of salt started collecting in the cracks of my knuckles. It\u2019s a climate perfectly suited to the island\u2019s primary inhabitants \u2014 bright green lizards that scatter over the parched landscape, scampering from one prickly bush to another whenever we walked past.Formentera is full of caves to explore, Instagram-friendly lighthouses, classically Mediterranean white stone villages, and mopeds zipping around. But the real action is at the beach.Early into our trip, we went to Playa de Migjorn (Lucky Beach), a stretch of sand on the southern side of the island, nicknamed for a beloved seaside restaurant shack that serves homemade pasta, bresaola, aperitivi, and \u201cmusic that is really something not to be missed,\u201d in the words of Davide Busi, one of the owners of Lucky Bar. \u201cWe combine the best of Italy with the best of Spain \u2014 figs and mozzarella and Ib\u00e9rico ham,\u201d said Mr. Busi, who is originally from Bologna.A few days later, we discovered Playa de Illetes (pronounced ee-YAY-tes) \u2014 a flat, gentle expanse of beach perfectly tailored for children, sunbathers and anyone who likes her waves no more than eight inches high. Walk out into the water a few feet \u2014 or a few hundred \u2014 and you will notice the water around Formentera is startlingly clear. It\u2019s like walking through liquid air.\u201cOne square meter of this seaweed gives more oxygen than one square meter of the Amazon rain forest,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the biggest concentration of it is right here between Ibiza and Formentera.\u201dPosidonia itself isn\u2019t much to look at \u2014 my children thought it was shredded newspaper. But our maiden trip to Illetes also revealed another one of Formentera\u2019s trademark characteristics: Sunscreen is not a booming industry here.The beach was teeming with glistening brown bodies; towels rotated toward the ultraviolet light like a field of sunflowers. Running around the sunbathers were the children \u2014 shaggy-haired, barely dressed in skimpy bathing suits, skin the color of mahogany, all calling to each other in Italian.My children, on the other hand, were dressed as if sunlight were their mortal enemy: wide-brim sun hats, long-sleeve rash guards, board shorts to their ankles. I had already covered the only exposed skin \u2014 the tops of their feet and the backs of their hands \u2014 with a thick white paste of sunscreen.We stood on the beach, Puritans at Woodstock, and gazed longingly at the Italian families. I asked my children to help me set up our umbrella.There are plenty of ways to test the outer limits of one\u2019s melanin on the island. For one thing, because of its place on the far reaches of the Spanish time zone, the Formentera sun sets after 9 p.m. There are typically over 300 days of sunshine here, not to mention a handful of nude beaches, a fact of which we were unaware \u2014 until we weren\u2019t.\u201cMommy?\u201d My son squinted up at me.\u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d\u201cI sure hope that man has sunscreen on his penis.\u201dIt was time for lunch.We headed into the main town of Sant Francesc Xavier for wine, pasta and a respite from the blazing sun. We found a table under the canopy of a fig tree at El Gioviale Caf\u00e9 & Restaurant, a trattoria run by Matteo and Francesco Trecca and Giulia Tulli, three Italians who brought recipes from the old country when they moved to Formentera a few years ago.\u201cOur mother taught us how to make proper Italian pasta,\u201d Matteo told me. \u201cShe owns a restaurant outside of Rome.\u201dSitting in the dappled Mediterranean sun with my daughter (my husband and son stayed at the beach), I could have easily believed we were in a restaurant outside Rome. Or Portofino. Or Positano. I read the options off the blackboard \u2014 spaghetti all\u2019amatriciana, rigatoni carbonara, insalata caprese \u2014 as my daughter wiggled the sand out of her toes. A short while later, Ms. Tulli appeared, her arms laden with saut\u00e9 pans \u2014 tonnarelli cacio e pepe for my daughter and penne pomodoro e mozzarella for me.Serving the pasta in the pans is a typically Italian way of reminding you just how authentic the sauce is \u2014 and ours, respectively cheesy and peppery and earthy and ripe, were so authentic we nearly licked our pans clean.Later that day, showered and dressed for an evening out, my family and I went to Es Pujols, a lively town on the northern side of the island. Es Pujols is the most Italian pocket of Formentera \u2014 many of the people who were walking on the boardwalk and sipping Campari and sodas spoke to us only in Italian when we tested our halting Spanish.We settled into a table at Cafe Miranda as the sun was just starting its dip toward the horizon \u2014 well past 9 and well past my children\u2019s typical bedtime. We ordered aperitivi \u2014 Aperol and prosecco for my husband and me, San Pellegrino Aranciata for the children, plump green olives and salty potato chips for all.We sat quietly for a few minutes, and I could feel my skin radiating warmth from our time on the beach. A handful of Italian soccer players strolled by with their girlfriends. Waiters were saying things like, \u201cBuona sera, signorina.\u201d The sea had taken on a romantic orange tint.Soon, our waiter came over to take our order for dinner, but quickly apologized.He only spoke Italian.Advertisement"}

She was waiting for a friend who was to accompany her to nearby galleries.She wore a fresh-pressed white linen jumpsuit and a goldtone vintage kimono that set off her loose shoulder-length hair, dyed for her role to a searing titian from its customary blond.Her screen wardrobe, like her hair, is brazenly at odds with her personally understated leanings. But then Ms. Gummer \u2014 who studied art history at Vassar College, interned for the designer Zac Posen and mostly acts as her own stylist \u2014 resists fashion typecasting. \u201cAs a performer, I want to be mutable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m careful about being groomed into a fashion role.\u201dMs. Gummer has appeared in fashion advertisements but balks at being too closely associated with high-end fashion labels. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that girl from C\u00e9line or Lanc\u00f4me,\u201d she said.In \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d she wears no-nonsense blazers, closefitting knits and trousers accessorized with heavy-duty black belts. \u201cDom doesn\u2019t hide herself,\u201d she said.

She promptly set off for their rendezvous at the David Zwirner Gallery.She kept up a line of patter as she strolled along 11th Avenue, her voice rising above gusts of wind and the whoosh of passing traffic. Ms. Gummer suggested that acting is something like journalism. \u201cYou like the chase,\u201d she said. \u201cYou like being the one to tell the story.

{"Headline": "Reasons to Believe the A.I. Boom Is Real", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byBitsArtificial intelligence is booming. But why now?The movement can be thought of as a spread of computing intelligence everywhere, on wheels and wings, in your pocket and all through your house. That\u2019s a big enough idea to fund scores of companies, and quite possibly set up the next Silicon Valley boom. And bubble.Yet it\u2019s worth asking how much of this is reality and how much is wishful thinking. Why is A.I. growing the way it didn\u2019t over the last several decades, despite promises that it would?The answer to that lies in the precursors to this A.I. moment, which more than anything has to do with the Google-led search boom 10 years ago.In 2006, Google and Yahoo released new methods of analyzing the quirky real-world data they were picking up from doing search. Data from browsers can be thought of as a proxy for human behavior, as people wander the web. It\u2019s typically called \u201cunstructured\u201d data, as opposed to the more regular information of things like banking and airline schedules that filled most of the world\u2019s databases.That new way of seeing the real world helped make search profitable and also enabled companies like Facebook to look into even stranger social behavior. The success also gave these companies plenty of money to plow into the problem.To money, and the first ever caches of natural behavior in digital form, add cheaper computing. In 2006, Amazon also introduced its cloud-computing business. Over the last decade, retail cloud computing has become an inexpensive way for lots of people to work on data analysis and pattern finding, the heart of A.I.Only one more thing was needed, and in 2007 Apple came out with the iPhone. Let that stand for browser-type natural data collection moving off desktops and blowing through the natural world. Along with other cheap sensors tied to the cloud, it has given us huge amounts of data about all sorts of things.That created many more places where computers could do what they\u2019ve always done, which is to seek efficiency. That has created a cycle:more observation, more machine learning of patterns, more value capture funding more observation.It\u2019s enough to make you believe in this boom.What could make you believe it\u2019s also a bubble? Start with the name, artificial intelligence. So far there is zero evidence we will be about to build machines that possess intelligence or will really think on their own.

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s World Cup Stadium Rises, Matryoshka Style", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Building new soccer stadiums almost always comes with controversy. Sometimes it has to do with the source of the money for the new building. In other cases, the concerns are more sobering, such as reports of human rights abuses of workers building projects for Qatar\u2019s 2022 bid.In Russia, which will host the World Cup in 2018, construction delays have been the primary issue. Concerns that the stadiums will not be ready on time are hardly unique to the World Cup, or to Russia. There is, however, one particularly unusual element to Russia\u2019s work at Luzhniki Stadium here in the capital, where the opening game and the final of the tournament will take place.Marat Akhmadiyev, the foreman for the project, explained the idiosyncrasy simply. \u201cWe will make a brand-new stadium,\u201d he said, \u201cinside an old stadium.\u201dLuzhniki, located in the southwest of this city, was always going to be the showpiece venue for Russia\u2019s World Cup; the stadium was built in the Stalinist style and opened in 1956. It hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics, and a giant statue of Lenin still stands outside its main entrance.Yet for the World Cup, an upgrade was required. And while some host committees might have opted for a teardown and rebuild, Russia\u2019s committee decided instead to, essentially, stuff a modern stadium inside the Soviet-era facade of the old one.Ambitious construction projects are not uncommon when it comes to World Cup bids \u2014 Brazil built a new stadium in Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon, for its tournament in 2014, and Qatar has pledged to have air-conditioned arenas in 2022 \u2014 but the Luzhniki rebuild is being done in an economic (and meteorological) climate that is especially challenging.The job also requires an atypical set of tools. Akhmadiyev and his crew of more than 2,000 workers have had to stabilize the old exterior walls of the stadium \u2014 in some cases, knocking out crumbling bricks one by one and replacing them \u2014 while adding a roof extension and building all-new tiers of seating. Special cranes accommodate the need to nimbly move between the roof and the facade, and electronic demands include installation of a state-of-the-art video screen as well as wiring for goal-line technology and, perhaps, video replay officiating.All of it is thrilling for Akhmadiyev, who was part of the construction for the Sochi Olympics and said he did not feel any particular pressure about the job, despite being asked to renovate a national landmark while maintaining its cultural identity.Roman Shirokov, a midfielder on Russia\u2019s national team, praised the effort to blend old and new.\u201cI think it was a good idea to keep the facade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a new stadium but still have the meaning that exists for so many.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some publishers and writers are exhuming out-of-print Trump biographies published decades ago and slapping new covers and introductions on them. Others are rushing out new books that explore Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning political rise.Like political pundits, publishers are sometimes bad prognosticators. Many editors were hesitant to commission books about Mr. Trump when he first entered the race and seemed like a long shot for the nomination. Once he became the presumptive nominee in May, agents, editors and writers were scrambling to pull together books in time for the election \u2014 a lightning-fast turnaround time in the publishing world.Fortunately for them, Mr. Trump has provided plenty of dramatic new material. With his bombastic swagger, changing policy positions and larger-than-life persona, Mr. Trump has proved to be an irresistible subject for writers and political satirists.This summer, as the race between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton accelerates, publishers are releasing a flurry of books that dissect Mr. Trump\u2019s short and eventful presidential run. In August, Melville House plans to release \u201cThe Making of Donald Trump,\u201d by the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston, which chronicles Mr. Trump\u2019s rise in real estate and his pivot to politics, and draws on decades of interviews, court documents and financial records.Later that month, Scribner is set to publish \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d a biography written by the Washington Post editor Marc Fisher and a Post investigative political reporter, Michael Kranish. It will draw on the work of more than two dozen Post reporters and researchers.These new books will bump up against the repackaged editions of older Trump biographies that have taken on new significance now that Mr. Trump is a presidential candidate running on his business record.\u201cWe thought, he\u2019s going to implode, there\u2019s no point,\u201d said Jamie Raab, the president and publisher of Grand Central Publishing.\u201cThe deposition has become one of the Rosetta stones of the 2016 campaigns, because you had a trio of fantastic lawyers holding his feet to the fire about his business dealings,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, a former editor for The New York Times. \u201cThey sort of stripped the bark off Trump like an old tree.\u201dStill, not every publisher has an appetite for taking on Trump.Harry Hurt III had hoped to republish his out-of-print unauthorized Trump biography, \u201cLost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,\u201d with his original publisher, W.W. Norton, this year. The book, an explosive expos\u00e9 of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal life and financial travails, caused a minor scandal when it came out in 1993. The biggest bombshell was an allegation from his first wife, Ivana Trump, that Mr. Trump had raped her \u2014 a claim that originated in a deposition she gave during their divorce proceedings. She later recanted the claim, and Mr. Hurt\u2019s book included a statement from Ms. Trump, inserted in the flyleaf, clarifying that she felt emotionally and not physically violated by her then husband. Mr. Trump never sued.But when Mr. Hurt asked Norton to republish the book this year, it declined, citing legal risks and the expenses associated with legal vetting and corrections. Norton, which declined to comment, returned the publication rights to Mr. Hurt.Mr. Hurt is eager to get the book out before the election. \u201cTime\u2019s a wasting,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this time next year, nobody will want to read about Donald Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After several years on \u201cCrossing Jordan,\u201d an early-aughts NBC procedural, she has appeared mostly in film and TV comedies, usually in supporting roles but always with gusto.Three young women who stopped Ms. Hahn on the street and requested selfies recognized her as Alice, the married woman seducing John C. Reilly in \u201cStep Brothers.\u201d Ms. Hahn said the role she is most often stopped for was an ongoing guest appearance as a hard-charging political consultant on \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201dDeposited on 10th Avenue, Ms. Hahn strolled toward the building on 49th Street where she and her husband, Ethan Sandler, an actor and writer/producer on \u201cNew Girl,\u201d spent eight years in a fourth-floor walk-up.She lived the archetypal struggling New York actress life: working as a receptionist by day (at Garren New York, the high-end hair salon), briefly waitressing at Joe Allen, the unofficial canteen of Broadway, and sending out endless head shots wherever she could. (This method resulted in the acquisition of a New Jersey agent and a gig passing out bagel sandwiches for Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.)On the stoop outside her old apartment building stood John Matejas, 78, enjoying the sunshine, his tank top tucked into belted jean shorts. His eyes widened when he saw Ms. Hahn; he had been the building\u2019s super when she lived there.He punched numbers into his clamshell phone and summoned his wife, Minerva, down from upstairs. Another set of eyes widened; tears came to eyes.\u201cFor us, she is like our daughter,\u201d Mr. Matejas said. (His own daughter had given birth to her own daughter in the years since Ms. Hahn had been a resident.) Ms. Matejas added that they heard about all her movies.After numbers were exchanged and photos taken to send to Ms. Hahn\u2019s husband, and promises to stay in touch, Ms. Hahn clambered down the stairs. She agreed cheerfully to an alfresco palm reading by a psychic set up at a curbside card table, who advised her she needed more positivity in her life.Actually, things are looking pretty positive for Ms. Hahn, the rare Hollywood actress whose prospects have been improving, rather than declining, after 40.Her leading role in \u201cBad Moms\u201d arrives just before another star turn, as a lovestruck, unhappily married filmmaker in \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d an Amazon pilot based on Chris Kraus\u2019s postmodern novel of the same name, by the \u201cTransparent\u201d creator, Jill Soloway.Ms. Soloway wrote the part of Rabbi Raquel for Ms. Hahn, which has made her a minor heartthrob in the Jewish community, although Ms. Hahn, surprising to many, was raised Roman Catholic.\u201cSometimes it takes an outsider to really get inside,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did have to walk me through some of the Hebrew. It doesn\u2019t just roll off the tongue.\u201d\u201c\u2018Backstage,\u2019 Equity showcases,\u201d Mr. Hahn said, recalling listings for \u201cbrief nudity, no pay.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t wait to audition for that show,\u201d Ms. Hahn replied.Though Ms. Hahn no longer has to contend with brief nudity, no pay, \u201cI feel like I still have a way\u2019s to go,\u201d she said.Hollywood is still getting a handle on her. \u201cI know that I don\u2019t necessarily fit the specific, you know, mold,\u201d she said, drolly. \u201cI certainly am not consciously trying to avoid big roles.

{"Headline": "Four Seasons, Lunch Spot for Manhattan\u2019s Prime Movers, Moves On", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byIn New York, a restaurant that lasts 10 years is old. Most fail to make it to their first birthday. When the Seagram Building turns the lights out on the Four Seasons restaurant next week, it will end a run that began in 1959. Eisenhower was president, the Edsel was still new and television viewers tuned in, for the first time, to \u201cBonanza\u201d and \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d It was a very long time ago.Its closing will mark the end of an era. The Four Seasons, probably the most important New York restaurant of the 20th century, Americanized fine dining and set in motion many of the trends that still dominate restaurant culture in the United States.In its time, the Four Seasons was the most modern, the most daring, the most New York restaurant the city had ever seen. Defined visually by the confident modernism of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Seagram Building, it expressed, through its menu, d\u00e9cor and clientele, a vision of Manhattan as the nerve center of the postwar era: a nexus of talent, money and ambition.When the city faltered in the 1970s, the Four Seasons remade itself. Hoping to appeal to a new generation of up-and-comers, it scaled back its extravagant menus and created a stage for the city\u2019s prime movers in publishing, advertising, fashion and finance. In the overhauled Bar Room, a cavernous, often empty space where patrons stopped in for a drink or took a table when the Pool Room was full, the power lunch was born. Every weekday at noon, in a ritual as formalized as a quadrille, Page Six names descended on what was now being called the Grill Room, took a seat at their customary table and dined \u2014 abstemiously.For food was not the attraction. \u201cPowerful people eat in order to be seen with other powerful people,\u201d Michael Korda, the former editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, and a Four Seasons regular, wrote in The New York Times in 1977. The choicest dish was not on the menu: the validation that came with being seated and served with an important client, surrounded by elite company.\u201cIn the past, the best restaurants were patronized by high society,\u201d said Paul Freedman, the author of \u201cTen Restaurants That Changed America,\u201d to be published in September by Liveright. \u201cThey were not places to do deals, but at the Four Seasons it was all about transacting business and being seen.\u201dThe cast of characters changed. Wall Street crashes, bankruptcies and the occasional indictment took a toll. But the milieu did not change much. There are regulars who have been regulars for 30 or 40 years, players in a social drama that has run longer than \u201cThe Fantasticks.\u201dIt is an impressive record for an afterthought. When the Seagram Building was under construction, the ground floor and lower level were 24,000-square-foot blanks to be filled in. There were plans to turn the rooms into exhibition spaces, or lease them to a bank or an auto dealership.Once Mr. Brody convinced Samuel Bronfman, the chairman of Seagram, that a restaurant would reinforce the company\u2019s image and add value to the building, Mr. Baum was turned loose. Philip Johnson, chairman of the architecture department at the Museum of Modern Art and Mies\u2019s assistant on the Seagram Building, was assigned to handle the architecture, with William Pahlmann responsible for the interior design.What sort of restaurant would it be? Mr. Baum was clear on one point: It would not be French, \u201cbecause we are not Frenchmen, we are Americans,\u201d as he later put it.This was radical. French cuisine epitomized fine dining in the United States, especially in Manhattan, where restaurants like Le Pavillon, Le Cafe Chambord and Voisin set an uncompromisingly Gallic tone.Mr. Baum could be cryptic when talking about his restaurant ideas. \u201cModern New York with Continental touches\u201d was one formulation, but the germ of the idea, and the name, remain somewhat obscure. He was a great admirer of the Vier Jahreszeiten (\u201cFour Seasons\u201d), the hotel in Munich. He was also taken by \u201cshibui,\u201d the Japanese concept of restrained elegance, which his friend Elizabeth Gordon, the editor of House Beautiful magazine, was then explaining to American readers. A haiku about the seasons set him to thinking about a way to embody shibui, and seasonality, in a restaurant that reflected its time and place.\u201cHe offered a very simple explanation: New York as crossroads of the world, the place where everything is happening, the capital city of modernity,\u201d Mimi Sheraton, a former restaurant critic for The Times, said in a recent interview.The restaurant\u2019s name was chosen from a long list of dubious candidates: the Four Seasons of the Zodiac, the Time Table, Season-o-Rama, among others.\u201cEvery day, from one to five in the banquet room of the Hotel Lexington, we would go through 35 dishes, starting with appetizers,\u201d Ms. Sheraton said. Albert St\u00f6ckli, Restaurant Associate\u2019s chameleon-like Swiss chef, who had an uncanny knack for making Mr. Baum\u2019s ideas edible, fed the team, working from a mandate that emphasized fresh ingredients supplied by small producers around the United States, seasonal changes and a contemporary, international slant on flavor combinations.The idea of seasonal change was carried through almost fanatically. Four times each year, new trees and floral displays would be trucked in; the waiters would get new uniforms; the menus would get a makeover; the ribbons in the typewriters would be changed; and the banquettes would be reupholstered.In the end, Mr. Baum created the most expensive restaurant in the city\u2019s history. The Four Seasons cost $4.5 million to open, nearly $40 million in today\u2019s dollars. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which opened the same year, cost $3 million.Craig Claiborne, then the food news editor of The Times, reviewed the Four Seasons two months after its July 29 opening. \u201cBoth in d\u00e9cor and in menu, it is spectacular, modern and audacious,\u201d he wrote, en route to calling it \u201cperhaps the most exciting restaurant to open in New York within the last two decades.\u201dHe expressed admiration for the lobster mousse and the lavish use of fresh herbs and mushrooms, rarely seen in American restaurants. He admired the appointments: paintings by Jackson Pollock and Joan Mir\u00f3; a giant Picasso stage curtain; tableware designed by L. Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable; flowers and ficus trees matched to the season. Anchored in the verities of French haute cuisine, however, he found the menu difficult to comprehend and, in some way, not right.Food historians now see it as the starting point for a series of trends that came to define American dining: the cult of freshness and organically grown ingredients, which Alice Waters embraced at Chez Panisse; the inventive interpretation of regional American dishes, which became known as New American cooking; the international blending of styles and ingredients, later described as fusion.\u201cIn 1959, they were naming the places where the ingredients came from,\u201d said Jeremiah Tower, the chef at Chez Panisse in the early 1970s. \u201cThey would write: \u2018Handpicked tomatoes from Long Island, carved tableside.\u2019 They were the first to pick up on farm-to-table.\u201dThe Four Seasons was not just an expensive proposition. The restaurant had never made money, and by the late 1960s, it was running on fumes, subsisting on the patronage of curious tourists. \u201cQuite clearly, there are not enough people, even in New York, to regularly underwrite first grouse from Scotland, fiddlefern from Maine, haricot from Paris, and nubbin carrots from Oregon,\u201d Michael Whiteman, the editor of Nation\u2019s Restaurant News, and later Mr. Baum\u2019s partner at Windows on the World, wrote in a letter to New York magazineRestaurant Associates, no longer interested in the fine-dining business, eased Mr. Baum out in 1970. Mr. Brody, who had committed the cardinal sin of divorcing the boss\u2019s daughter, was out too. \u201cIn every sense, the Four Seasons was losing its soul, its personality and its allure,\u201d John Mariani wrote in \u201cThe Four Seasons: A History of America\u2019s Premier Restaurant\u201d (1994).In 1973, Tom Margittai, a vice president of Restaurant Associates\u2019 fine-dining division, and Paul Kovi, director of the Four Seasons, put down $15,000 in cash to buy the restaurant and set about transforming it into a club for young executives, the kind of people they called \u201cthe doers.\u201dPart of the plan was to turn the Bar Room into a grill, a less formal alternative to the Pool Room with simple, quickly prepared dishes like skewered shrimp with chipolata sausages, chicken paillard, gravlax with dill mustard sauce.The new owners made shrewd hiring decisions. They brought in Seppi Renggli, another versatile Swiss chef, to re-energize the kitchen. Alex von Bidder, 26, a young Swiss hotelier, was hired to build up the banquet business, and Julian Niccolini, a Tuscan with solid hotel experience in Europe, was handed the sensitive task of managing the Grill Room. He proved to be a rare combination, both diplomat and court jester.The makeover worked. Nora Ephron found the location convenient and began turning up for lunch. The grandees of publishing followed her lead: Richard E. Snyder and Michael Korda of Simon & Schuster, Phyllis Grann of Putnam, Alexander Liberman of Cond\u00e9 Nast, Jason Epstein of Random House. John Fairchild, the publisher of Women\u2019s Wear Daily, became a regular, as did the literary agents Morton L. Janklow and Lynn Nesbit. Financiers like Peter G. Peterson, the chairman of Lehman Brothers, staked their claims, along with the fashion designer Bill Blass and the advertising executive Lois Wyse.Credit for the term \u201cpower lunch\u201d usually goes to Lee Eisenberg, who, in a 1979 Esquire article titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Powerful Lunch,\u201d decoded the Grill Room and, as a service to the reader, offered an annotated seating plan matching diner to table.But conceptual ground had already been broken, from an insider\u2019s view, two years earlier by Mr. Korda, in an article for The Times headlined \u201cLe Plat du Jour Is Power.\u201d Mr. Korda understood the fine points and perverse politics of powerful eating, which valued conspicuous nonconsumption. \u201cThe most powerful person is the one who can order the meal with the lowest number of calories,\u201d he wrote. Catering to this philosophy, the restaurant would introduce an irreducibly plain dish: a baked potato served with a bottle of olive oil on the side.The power parade continued through the decades, and the Four Seasons became, for the first time, a profitable restaurant. Whenever attrition threatened to thin the ranks, new recruits turned up. Henry Kissinger, after leaving Washington, added his clout to the daily seating chart.When book publishers began cutting costs in the 1990s, a phalanx of financiers and real estate developers rose to take the seats once reserved by editors. An army of Cond\u00e9 Nast editors descended, turning the Grill Room into a company canteen. Art Cooper, the editor of GQ, occupied a corner booth and spent about $200,000 a year at the restaurant. He ate his last meal at the Four Seasons, suffering a fatal stroke at the age of 65 while eating lunch in 2003.Over time, the lively dance of the Four Seasons became a frieze, the daily power-lunch ritual an arthritic display.In 2000, the German-born real estate developer Aby J. Rosen bought the Seagram Building with his partner in RFR Holding, Michael Fuchs. It did not take a crystal ball to predict the future. Mr. Rosen, a fan of contemporary art and experimental theater, looked at the restaurant\u2019s time-honored rituals and its older clientele with a cold eye.In 2013, he told the New York Landmarks Conservancy that he intended to move the Picasso curtain, \u201cLe Tricorne,\u201d to carry out repairs on the wall behind it. The conservancy, the owner of the artwork since 2005, when the French entertainment giant Vivendi donated it after having acquired Seagram five years earlier, said the curtain, measuring 19 by 20 feet, was so fragile that it would crumble \u201clike potato chips\u201d if moved.Picasso had created the curtain, which depicts a bullfighting arena, for a 1919 Ballets Russes production and sold it in 1957 to the Bronfman family for about $50,000. When the Seagram Building, including the interior of the Four Seasons, was granted landmark status in 1989, the curtain was excluded from the designation because it was not part of the building\u2019s structure.The Picasso contretemps had sent an unmistakable message. The Four Seasons\u2019s lease was set to expire in 2016. Mr. Rosen made it clear that he was going to let it. \u201cI love the guys, but their time has passed, and sometimes something great has to go,\u201d he told The Times last year.He hired the young partners in the Major Food Group, responsible for the buzzy restaurants Carbone, Dirty French and Santina, to come up with a replacement for the Four Seasons. Like Mr. Baum, they will have to start from scratch. After 57 years, it is 1959 again.Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Sunday 10 with an article about the history of the Four Seasons restaurant misstated the year Philip Johnson, the restaurant\u2019s main architect, celebrated his 95th birthday.

With \u201cLa Chienne,\u201d Renoir invented a new sort of plein-air cinema, pioneering a fluid naturalism predicated on his ability to shoot sound on location without sacrificing the freedom to move his camera.\u201cA Married Woman,\u201d which could also have been titled \u201cLa Chienne,\u201d was known as \u201cThe Married Woman,\u201d until French censors insisted that Mr. Godard shift his portrait of an adulterous wife from the general to the specific.\u201cA Married Woman\u201d opens in the midst of an afternoon tryst between Charlotte (Macha M\u00e9ril) and her lover, Robert (Bernard No\u00ebl), an actor, and more or less follows her through the next 24 hours. Leaving Robert\u2019s apartment, Charlotte goes to the airport to meet her aviator husband, Pierre (Philippe Leroy), whom she wonders if she should divorce.The couple spend an amicable night together, filmed to mirror Charlotte\u2019s encounter with her lover; the next afternoon, she has another rendezvous with Robert, in a hotel by another airport. In between, Charlotte does some shopping, is regaled by her housecleaner on the subject of conjugal relations, goes to the movies and, discovering that she is pregnant, decides that she must choose between the men.The sex scenes are daringly fragmented and almost abstract while the narrative is bluntly symmetrical. The personal is also the political: Mr. Godard\u2019s objectification of Charlotte is set in a landscape of posters and magazine ads devoted to the objectification of women.Released in the United States to Godard\u2019s best reviews since \u201cBreathless,\u201d \u201cA Married Woman\u201d inspired a mass market paperback that in announcing itself as \u201ccompletely illustrated\u201d was not dissimilar from the magazines and best sellers that invade Charlotte\u2019s consciousness and could easily have been incorporated into the movie\u2019s ubiquitous sociological critique of popular culture. But critics were not sure what to make of Charlotte.Pert and pixielike, Ms. M\u00e9ril maintains a mysterious half-smile throughout. She is something of an enigma, although much of the movie is annotated by her voice-over narration. She is apparently a movie buff, capable of citing Louis Feuillade\u2019s \u201cFant\u00f4mas\u201d as she frisks topless on Robert\u2019s roof. But she is also shallow, failing to recognize the word \u201cAuschwitz,\u201d and, of course, naturally faithless, manifested in her habit of arbitrarily changing taxis.Intelligent and self-aware, Ms. M\u00e9ril has much to say about Mr. Godard\u2019s filmmaking and the making of \u201cA Married Woman.\u201d In a way, this postscript \u2014 recorded in 2010 \u2014 provides her Mona Lisa character with an alternative inner life.NEWLY RELEASEDThe DVD column last Sunday misstated part of the title of a film based on a novel by Guy de Maupassant. It is \u201cThe Private Affairs of Bel Ami,\u201d not \u201cThe Private Affairs of Ben Ami.\u201d An accompanying list of new releases misspelled the given name of the French author whose novel was adapted into the film \u201cUnder the Sun of Satan.\u201d He was Georges Bernanos, not George.Advertisement"}

Google could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe\u2019s tough competition rules.Google said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide a detailed response to Europe\u2019s latest charges, but it added, \u201cWe believe our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for E.U. consumers and promote competition.\u201d The company has until the fall to respond.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Europe\u2019s new antitrust charges represent a further ratcheting up of the region\u2019s often frosty relationship with Google.In particular, European antitrust officials are taking aim at some of the company\u2019s online advertising tools \u2014 the main engine for Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue. They say that the company may have abused its dominant market position when offering some of its search products on third-party companies\u2019 websites.These businesses \u2014 including publishers and online retailers \u2014 can use Google\u2019s search engine on their sites so that people can find information like newspaper articles or promotions. Such agreements with third-party companies, which date to 2006, also include showing paid-for advertising next to search results, often provided by Google.Ms. Vestager said on Thursday that the technology company may have abused its dominance \u2014 it holds roughly an 80 percent market share in this type of niche on-site search \u2014 by forcing companies to sign onerous contracts that limited competition and reduced consumer choice.Since 2009, Google has made it easier for advertising rivals to show their offerings alongside its services. But Europe\u2019s competition chief said that Google still required third-party companies to show a minimum number of Google-provided ads on their site. The Silicon Valley company also requires businesses using the service to ask for approval on where some rivals\u2019 ads may be shown on their websites.\u201cAll these restrictions allowed Google to protect its market share and stifle competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Europe\u2019s antitrust authorities have also doubled down on a previous competition charge, announced last year, which claimed that Google had diverted traffic from competitors in favor of its own comparison-shopping site. On Thursday, Ms. Vestager said her team had found new evidence to buttress their claims, adding that because of Google\u2019s actions, European consumers may not have access to the most relevant search results when looking online for goods and services.Yet when asked about the failure of European antitrust authorities to order fines or changes to the way Google does business, despite several years of investigations, Ms. Vestager said she aimed to ensure the charges against the company stood up in European courts.\u201cSpeed is of the essence,\u201d but \u201cthe other side of that coin is quality,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Thursday. \u201cSometimes that kind of quality comes at the cost of speed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But all that goes out the window when you call tech support. Then you fume. Your face turns red. You shout things into the phone that would appall your mother.It\u2019s called tech support rage.And you are not alone. Getting caught in a tech support loop \u2014 waiting on hold, interacting with automated systems, talking to people reading from unhelpful scripts and then finding yourself on hold yet again \u2014 is a peculiar kind of aggravation that mental health experts say can provoke rage in even the most mild-mannered person.Worse, just as you suspected, companies are aware of the torture they are putting you through.Moreover, 73 percent said the complexity of tech support calls is increasing as customers have become more technologically sophisticated and can resolve simpler issues on their own.Many organizations are running a cost-per-contact model, which limits the time agents can be on the phone with you, hence the agony of round-robin transfers and continually being placed on hold, said Justin Robbins, who was once a tech support agent himself and now oversees research and editorial at ICMI.\u201cDon\u2019t think companies haven\u2019t studied how far they can take things in providing the minimal level of service,\u201d Mr. Robbins said. \u201cSome organizations have even monetized it by intentionally engineering it so you have to wait an hour at least to speak to someone in support, and while you are on hold, you\u2019re hearing messages like, \u2018If you\u2019d like premium support, call this number and for a fee, we will get to you immediately.\u2019\u201dAT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications did not respond to requests for comment.Especially frustrating when talking to tech support is not being understood because you are trying to communicate with machines or people who have been trained to talk like machines, either for perceived quality control or because they don\u2019t speak English well enough to go off-script.When things don\u2019t make sense and feel out of control, mental health experts say, humans instinctively feel threatened. Though you would like to think you can employ reason in this situation, you\u2019re really just a mass of neural impulses and primal reactions. Think fight or flight, but you can\u2019t do either because you are stuck on the phone, which provokes rage.But tech support veterans and mental health experts said there were other ways to get better tech support or maybe just make it more bearable. First, do whatever it takes to control your temper. Take a deep breath. Count to 10. Losing your stack at a consumer support agent is not going to get your problem resolved any faster. Probably just the opposite.Don\u2019t bother demanding to speak to a supervisor, either. You\u2019re just going to get transferred to another agent who has been alerted ahead of time that you have come unhinged, Mr. Robbins said. Also, be aware that your words are being recorded and might be printed on posters in the call center.\u201cI\u2019ve seen companies make T-shirts with the cruel, awful things people say,\u201d Mr. Robbins said. He added the shirts might provide an impetus to improve because customers have been driven to such extremes, \u201cbut then it also may just show some people are truly from crazy town.\u201dCustomer support experts recommended using social media, like tweeting or sending a Facebook message, to contact a company instead of calling. You are likely to get a quicker response, not only because fewer people try that channel but also because your use of social media shows that you know how to vent your frustration to a wider audience if your needs are not met, as well as to praise them publicly when you are treated well, they said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Earnings Are Up, Cushioned by Its Cloud Business", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft is best known for software products like Windows and Office. If you bought a PC, more often than not it came with Windows, and chances are you bought a copy of Office to go with it.But the personal computers that Microsoft makes a lot of software for aren\u2019t selling the way they once did. And the company\u2019s entry into the smartphone business \u2014 which has been eating into PC sales for several years \u2014 was a disaster.It\u2019s a good thing Microsoft is determined not to miss the boat on cloud computing, a current trend that connects people over the internet to software hosted in big data centers.On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter.Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers.\u201cI think they\u2019ve done extraordinarily well,\u201d said Merv Adrian, an analyst at the technology research firm Gartner. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody else who is arguably the challenger to Amazon that Microsoft is.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer.There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable \u2014 a trade-off for slimmer margins.After Microsoft\u2019s misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business.Microsoft bought Nokia\u2019s mobile handset business in 2014 for $9.4 billion, with the goal of making Windows relevant in smartphones, a market dominated by Google\u2019s Android software and Apple\u2019s iPhones.Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago.For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier.Still, Microsoft sometimes manages to outperform the PC market, as it did this quarter, often through sales of the operating systems for higher-end machines.The company\u2019s Windows revenue from PCs sold for the professional market rose 2 percent in the quarter. Windows revenue from the nonprofessional market rose 27 percent, though that was in comparison with an unusually weak quarter last year.For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.The company\u2019s shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.The loss a year ago included $8.4 billion in charges related to a write-down in the value of the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia, along with expenses from layoffs in that group. The pain continued in its most recent quarter with further write-downs and restructuring charges related to its phone business totaling $1.1 billion.Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.Without the deferral, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion, better than the $22.14 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. And excluding the deferral and phone business charges, it earned 69 cents a share, better than the 58 cents a share average estimate of analysts.About 6 cents a share of the upside in its earnings was the result of a lower-than-expected tax rate, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a phone interview.\u201cThis is a nice strong quarter,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s still a company in a pivot with some declining legacy businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}

W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, Hollywood came forth with kindred productions. Other national industries did as well, but Italians and Americans have proved most attached to the mode. For Italians, the peplum recalled the glory that was Rome; for Hollywood in the 1950s, such movies served to showcase the cinematic might of the American imperium that arose from the ashes of World War II.\u201cGods of Egypt,\u201d directed by Alex Proyas (best known for \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cDark City\u201d), has no such agenda, though Mr. Proyas, who is of Greek descent and was born in Alexandria, Egypt, might seem well suited to revisit the world of the peplum. For all its Egyptian bric-a-brac, however, \u201cGods\u201d is largely set in a place resembling an earthquake-prone, Caribbean megaresort populated by men attired in leather frocks and women who favor studded bikini tops and snug pareus.When it comes to the peplum, costumes are less important than projecting the fantasy of a pre-Christian civilization. While it\u2019s true that Old Testament Hebrews are often shown as proto-Christians and early Christians frequently figure in tales of imperial Rome, these movies typically wallow in pagan \u201cimmorality,\u201d if only to deplore it.\u201cGods of Egypt\u201d is post-pagan and post-Christian. Its model is less the Egyptian Book of the Dead than the Marvel comic book \u201cThor.\u201d Despite a subplot involving two mortal lovers (Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton), the movie is basically a power struggle between a hunky pair of cosmic roughnecks, Horus (the Danish actor and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Set (Gerard Butler). Other deities include a slinky love goddess (\u00c9lodie Yung) and the fey brainiac Thoth (Chadwick Boseman, who is an exception to the movie\u2019s gratuitously Eurocentric casting).Geoffrey Rush gives the sun god Ra a humorously smug hauteur: His personal space station, positioned high above the digital masses, and the atomic-powered, Uzi-like automatic weapon that he fires each night at an approaching dragon of darkness epitomize the movie\u2019s cheesy grandeur. Mr. Rush also gets to deliver the prize groaners in the clich\u00e9d dialogue written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless: \u201cThere are some things worse than Set,\u201d he puns by way of introducing the monster.As a peplum, though, the movie is decidedly decadent. The digitally contrived effect in which 9-foot gods mix it up with normal-size mortals suggests nothing so much as celebrities slumming with their fans. The only religion here is show business.Robert Rossen (1908-1966) wrote, produced and directed \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d to mark his triumphant return from the Hollywood blacklist after cooperating with the House Un-American Activities Committee. However ham-fisted his filmmaking, Mr. Rossen \u2014 the son of a Lower East Side rabbi \u2014 was a serious man. (The credits for \u201cAlexander\u201d list Prince Peter of Greece as technical adviser.)Despite an atmosphere of unrelenting pomp and the alarmingly blond fright wig worn by Richard Burton in the title role, \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d has little to engage a taste for camp or Surrealism. If anything, this leaden yet intermittently fascinating movie anticipates \u201cSpartacus\u201d (1960) in its attempt to dress political issues in a toga, while administering a dollop of Freud. The impetuous Alexander requires only a few seconds to cut the Gordian knot, but needs much of the movie\u2019s 136 minutes to free himself, if he ever does, from his Oedipal family bonds.As a character study, \u201cAlexander\u201d is the logical successor to Mr. Rossen\u2019s \u201cBody and Soul\u201d (1947), about a slum-born prizefighter\u2019s rise, fall and redemption, and his Oscar-winning 1949 adaptation of Robert Penn Warren\u2019s \u201cAll the King\u2019s Men,\u201d which concerned an American demagogue\u2019s lust for power. The movie not only broods upon the nature of freedom and cost of civilization but also wonders what it might mean to imagine oneself divine. (Clearly, Mr. Rossen had the conquering dictators Hitler and Stalin on his mind.)In dramatizing these weighty thoughts, Mr. Rossen, an effective director of actors, is well served by his cast. \u201cAlexander\u201d has some memorable performances, from, among others, Danielle Darrieux and Fredric March as Alexander\u2019s warring parents, Claire Bloom as his strong-minded mistress and Peter Cushing as his Athenian adversary.Mr. Burton, who plays Alexander as a man with a head full of ideas that have driven him insane, delivers his most ridiculous lines with a furious conviction appropriate to his role. (Even as a child, Alexander \u201cbelieved himself a god,\u201d explains his erstwhile tutor, Aristotle.)If Alexander\u2019s announced mission was \u201cto bring Greek culture to the world,\u201d Mr. Burton\u2019s was to bring gravitas to Mr. Rossen\u2019s movie. He succeeds, as does the labor-intensive spectacle itself. Decades into the age of C.G.I., there\u2019s a poignant quality to the sight of real sets, actual locations and hordes of human extras on the screen.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Price-Fixing Truck Makers Get Record E.U. Fine: $3.2 Billion", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief imposed a record fine of 2.9 billion euros, or $3.2 billion, on a group of truck makers on Tuesday, part of a trend toward steeper penalties for competition violations in the 28-nation bloc.Among the companies cited in the statement for having broken antitrust rules is the truck maker MAN, which is owned by Volkswagen. MAN is not among the companies being fined, however, as it revealed the existence of the cartel.In the statement, the commission said it did not find any links between the cartel and so-called defeat devices installed by Volkswagen in passenger cars.The truck makers being fined are DAF, Daimler, Iveco and Volvo-Renault. Daimler faces the largest single fine, and it must pay slightly more than \u20ac1 billion, also a record.Together, the five companies account for about nine in 10 medium and heavy trucks produced in Europe, the commission said.A sixth company, Scania, was not included in the fines announced on Tuesday as it has not settled.Fines in the region for cartel violations have steadily risen in recent years, largely because financial punishment is the main way for European Union regulators, who unlike their American counterparts cannot jail price-fixers, to enforce their laws. From 1990 to 1994, the bloc imposed fines on cartels totaling \u20ac540 million. Two decades later, from 2010 to 2014, the commission imposed fines on cartels totaling \u20ac8.7 billion.Even so, the number of American companies in her sights has led some critics to suggest that Ms. Vestager and her predecessors have a bias against competition from the United States. The record-breaking fines imposed against the truck companies \u2014 which are all based in Europe \u2014 could help counter that view.In a separate case on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager\u2019s team opened an investigation into whether French government plans for financially supporting Areva, a beleaguered state-owned maker of equipment for nuclear power plants, are compatible with European Union competition rules.Advertisement"}

From there, you can add mini bundles, like an extra $5 a month for a group of sports channels, or an additional $5 a month for a children\u2019s bundle including Disney Junior and Nick Toons.Users should be aware that Vue was designed primarily for Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4, which costs about $350. That means the default setup is to use a game controller with the service, though Sony also offers a universal PlayStation 4 remote control that works with Vue for about $30.Sony also offers Vue apps for iPhones, iPads and Android devices, as well as the Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire streaming gadgets.Sling TV works on more devices, including iPhones, iPads and Android devices, plus Apple TV, the Amazon Fire, Roku, Chromecast and the Microsoft Xbox, among others.Another difference is that Vue includes DVR, or the ability to record programs to watch later. You can tag your favorite shows and watch episodes for up to 28 days. Sling TV lacks this ability.For longtime cable subscribers, the limitations on content on Vue and Sling TV may be the toughest to digest. The snags include delays in live broadcasts, the inability to fast-forward through some content, and some missing important channels.With Sling TV, there were long delays when watching live sports. When streaming the Wimbledon tournament, for example, tennis matches were at least 30 seconds behind the live broadcast of the same match on a cable box. This defeats the purpose of watching live sports \u2014 the scores I saw on the screen were behind the scores shown on cable TV or those popping up on Twitter.Sling TV said a number of factors caused broadcast delays, including the internet connection, type of content and channel. By contrast, there was no noticeable delay when watching live sports on Vue.Both services also offer some programs for on-demand viewing, or the ability to watch them whenever you want \u2014 yet for many shows on both services, the services were forbidden to fast-forward through on-demand content. Sony and Sling said the inability to skip through some recorded content was because of agreements with content partners \u2014 in other words, they want you to watch the commercials. The old-school setup of a cable box with TiVo is still more convenient.There are other restrictions, like some major channels missing from both bundles. Sling TV lacks CBS, CW and Discovery, among others. PlayStation Vue also lacks major channels including CW, BBC America and A&E.Another limitation on Vue is that your PlayStation needs to stay put \u2014 meaning if you activated Vue in your house and then took the PlayStation to your family member\u2019s house, you could not log in to Vue. Sony said that network providers designed this restriction to limit TV viewing to your home.Watching TV on a big screen is a group experience, so it\u2019s important to be able to hand the remote control to others to let them channel surf. So I invited my neighbors over and asked them to do something simple with Vue and Sling TV: Find something they wanted to watch. They accomplished the tasks fairly quickly on both services, though they struggled with the PlayStation game controller.One neighbor, who works for a utility company, took about three minutes to figure out how to use the PlayStation controller to load the TV guide and pick something to watch. His wife, a scientist, took about a minute. A third neighbor, a museum worker, fumbled with the controller for about four minutes before finding an episode of \u201cScandal.\u201d They all found the universal remote control, which Sony sells separately, much more intuitive.By contrast, the test subjects all immediately knew how to use Sling TV to pick TV shows or sports events they wanted to watch, using a Roku TV remote, largely because its interface was more streamlined than the Vue\u2019s.It\u2019s tough to recommend either Vue or Sling TV as replacements for a majority of cable subscribers. Technologically, both Vue and Sling TV have better-designed software than a traditional cable box from Comcast, Time Warner or Charter. But because there are some missing major channels and annoying restrictions on how content can be watched, most consumers are better off sticking with cable.Sports fans may enjoy getting access to ESPN and other sports channels on either Vue or Sling TV for less than the cost of a traditional cable subscription. But the broadcast delay on Sling TV is a deal breaker. And if you don\u2019t regularly play video games, buying a PlayStation 4 just for watching sports is costly and impractical. (The Vue apps made for cheaper streaming devices, like Roku and Fire TV, aren\u2019t as powerful as the PlayStation app.)Roger Lynch, the chief executive of Sling TV, said the service gave people the flexibility to subscribe to bundles based on their preferences. \u201cEveryone has their own reasons for becoming a Sling subscriber,\u201d he said in an interview.Eric Lempel, a marketing executive for Sony, said, \u201cWe wanted to give you all the channels that you want,\u201d without the need to pay for hundreds of unnecessary channels.For a small set of cable subscribers, both Vue and Sling TV will have all the channels they want, but they will also include unwanted channels, too.In a perfect world, consumers could pick each channel they want and pay for it, \u00e0 la carte. But the content providers still hold the cards, and there is no easy way to do that quite yet.Advertisement"}

How Mr. McNeil, a science and health reporter for The New York Times, managed to accomplish this so fast I cannot fathom.In a no-nonsense, declarative writing style, Mr. McNeil tells the history of humanity\u2019s relationship with the Zika virus, recounting how an equatorial African microbe surfaced in the Yap Islands in the Pacific in 2007, infecting 73 percent of the population in just five months. Six years later, the virus, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, arose in Tahiti, or French Polynesia, where an estimated 66 percent of the population was infected over roughly nine months. Polynesian athletes unwittingly carried the virus to Recife, Brazil, where they participated in the FIFA Confederations Cup soccer games. El Ni\u00f1o, which radically altered rainfall patterns across the Amazon region in 2015, is credited with causing a surge in mosquitoes across the area, fostering the Zika explosion.Since Mr. McNeil\u2019s book was finished on June 1, numerous new findings have offered further cause for concern about Zika\u2019s arrival in the United States.Mr. McNeil ends with simple words: \u201cStay alert. And empathetic.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad summary of how all of us \u2014 public health experts, politicians, ordinary citizens \u2014 should respond to outbreaks of contagious disease. Being alert is far superior to the alternatives of nonchalance and fearfulness. And empathy is clearly better than common reactions to disease: stigmatization of the afflicted, disdain toward those most at risk for infection and political dithering that leaves populations in peril with few facts and no financing to stop the microbes\u2019 spread.Laurie Garrett is senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of \u201cThe Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance.\u201dZika The Emerging Epidemic By Donald G.

The stages came together, and so did the voices.With this operatically over-the-top spectacle last week \u2014 which drew squeals and flurries of smartphone photos as people passed on a vaporetto, or water bus \u2014 Mr. Domingo became the latest classical star to shoot a cameo for \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d the Amazon comedy about a fictional New York orchestra.It was not always thus.David Gockley, the veteran American impresario, said that those television appearances drove a wider interest in the art form \u2014 and sold tickets. \u201cOur audience knew a lot of these names because they were on television,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the mainstream media paying much attention to opera these days, and it makes a difference.\u201dPeter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, said that dwindling television opportunities had forced the company to reach audiences in new ways \u2014 both by starting its Live in HD cinema simulcasts and through social media. Last season, he said, the Met\u2019s videos were viewed about 7.5 million times on Facebook and YouTube. \u201cWe have to create our own communications systems,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.The show, of course, has Mozart in its title, and is loosely based on the 2005 memoir of the same name by Blair Tindall, an oboist who set out to explore, in the words of her subtitle, \u201cSex, Drugs and Classical Music.\u201d So a good portion of the viewers who stream it may already be music fans. But with a cast that includes stars like Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Bernadette Peters, Malcolm McDowell, Lola Kirke and, in a small role, Jason Schwartzman, the series also draws viewers who may not (yet) have subscriptions to their local orchestras.Paul Weitz, who was directing the episode with Mr. Domingo and is an executive producer of the show with Roman Coppola and Mr. Schwartzman, said that the possibility of reaching those viewers was especially enticing to the musicians who have appeared.\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a huge issue, and it\u2019s something that is dealt with in the show a lot, about whether classical music is going to be passed on to a new generation,\u201d Mr. Weitz said between shots in his director\u2019s chair. \u201cAnd all these artists, the reasons that they\u2019re doing this show is because they feel like it\u2019s good for that aspect of the art \u2014 that it can bring the music to different people. And anecdotally, I think that\u2019s actually the case.\u201dMr. Domingo, who moved to Mexico as a child and maintains strong ties there, said that he was drawn partly by the chance to appear with Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal, a Mexican actor whose career he has followed since the film \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d more than a decade ago, and partly because he was intrigued by a new series that shines a light on the field.So Mr. Domingo, who remains one of the hardest workers in opera, recorded his vocals for the duet, \u201cL\u00e0 ci darem la mano,\u201d this month at a midnight session at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, right after finishing a performance there in the title role of Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimon Boccanegra.\u201d (The soprano part, which Ms. Bellucci, who is playing a fiery diva known as La Fiamma, lip-synced to, was recorded in San Francisco by the rising star Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez.)And last week he flew here for a one-night shoot, the day after singing in Verdi\u2019s \u201cI Due Foscari\u201d at Teatro Real in Madrid, where he sang the role of the Doge of Venice. \u201cWhen I finished,\u201d he said, \u201cI said, \u2018Tomorrow I\u2019ll go to my city to see how my people are behaving.\u2019\u201dMr. Weitz said that the aria struck the tone he strove for in the show \u2014 mixing ridiculous and comic elements with sublime moments, through music. \u201cNico\u2019s fake Amy Fisher opera actually achieves that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely preposterous and silly and at the same time \u2014 and this was very important, it\u2019s what I was hoping for \u2014 it\u2019s actually moving.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Using the SI Play platform and its app, parents would be able to sign their children up for teams, follow their schedules and buy merchandise. A new mobile app would allow them to communicate with other parents and update game scores in real time.\u201cThis is going to be a huge opportunity,\u201d Mr. Karp said.\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that they\u2019ve turned things around,\u201d said Tim Nollen, a senior analyst at Macquarie Capital. \u201cAnyone in this country would look at it as a magazine publisher that is struggling.\u201dHoping for something of a resurgence, the company on Wednesday named Alan Murray, the editor of Fortune, as its chief content officer, overseeing all of Time Inc.\u2019s editors in the United States. Mr. Murray, 61, a former deputy managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, succeeds Norman Pearlstine, 73, a former editor in chief of Time Inc. who rejoined the company in 2013 and helped guide it through its spinoff.Time Inc. also announced a broader reorganization of its advertising sales and brand development teams, including the creation of dedicated digital sales teams, as it shifts its attention away from its print products, which include magazines like Time, People, InStyle, Entertainment Weekly and Sports Illustrated.Other publishers who long depended on print advertising are also fighting to survive. But Time Inc.\u2019s approach has at times seemed frenetic. It has pushed aggressively into areas like mobile, events, video and native advertising. In the last year, it purchased HelloGiggles, a lifestyle site aimed at women, and Viant, the parent company of Myspace. In addition to SI Play, it recently introduced Instant, a mobile platform featuring videos about celebrities. At an annual presentation to advertisers in May, it announced plans for an ad-supported streaming video service from People and Entertainment Weekly.Those moves, however, do not mask disappointing financial numbers. Last year, circulation revenue declined 5 percent and advertising revenue fell 7 percent. Newsstand revenue fell 8 percent.In the first quarter of 2016, Time Inc. reported a net loss of $10 million.\u201cYes, the results are bad,\u201d Mr. Nollen, the analyst said. Still, he added, \u201cI think they\u2019re doing the right thing to convert to a better media business beyond trying to make print magazines.\u201dThere have been bright spots. Digital advertising revenue increased 23 percent in the first quarter of 2016, and its sites now draw about 110 million unique visitors a month in the United States, according to comScore.In an interview, Mr. Murray shared little on his vision for the editorial direction of the company. Instead, he said he intended to focus on new forms of advertising and the company\u2019s mobile and social strategies. \u201cWe have to think differently about how we relate to our advertisers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to help brands tell their stories,\u201d he added, echoing what has become an oft-repeated marketing catchphrase.Joseph A. Ripp, the chief executive of Time Inc., said that the company would continue to focus on its digital side and would also look to grow its international business even as it faced headwinds. Mr. Pearlstine, who will stay at the company as vice chairman, will focus on international opportunities, Mr. Ripp said.The leadership shuffle will most likely bring more questions about the future of Time Inc.\u2019s magazines. At the very least, Mr. Murray\u2019s new role means the company will have to find a new editor for Fortune, a big-name brand whose luster, like that of other magazines in Time Inc.\u2019s portfolio, has faded even as its website continues to publish scoops that can send the financial media world into a tizzy.For all of the emphasis on digital growth, Mr. Ripp insisted that the company was still devoted to its magazines.\u201cPrint will continue to shrink slowly over time,\u201d Mr. Ripp said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re simply doing is we\u2019re not defining ourselves as a print company as we were before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smart Doesn\u2019t Always Mean an Easy Home", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s a reason they call them Smart Homes, not Easy Homes.But setting up the system turned out to be a \u201cherculean task,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. Eventually, he got the lights to work remotely, but the door lock never did, so he quit trying.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately what I am looking for: Fire it up, take some time setting it up, then it just works.\u201dThese days, even a technophobe can set up a remote-control light switch or thermostat and operate it by phone. Improvements in technology, including voice recognition, artificial intelligence and more affordable sensors, have made home automation easier to use. Cheaper, too.The smart home still isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 or easy, exactly. But if you haven\u2019t used any of this technology yet, it might be time to start thinking about it. Here\u2019s what you need to know first.Smart home technology is a catchall term that includes household appliances and devices that connect to the internet, so you can see and control them remotely using a phone, tablet or computer. That can mean being able to turn on a single lamp, or controlling and monitoring almost everything in a house, including heating and cooling, security cameras, lawn sprinklers, televisions, stereos, robotic vacuums, a doorbell, door locks, lights, air quality, fire alarms, baby monitors and more. It means you\u2019ll always have the answer to the question, \u201cDid I leave the stove on?\u201dIf you stick to a single system \u2014 say, all lights or electrical outlets from the same manufacturer \u2014 setup is pretty easy. But chances are, you\u2019ll want to use products from more than one company, and that\u2019s where the difficulty comes in: Different brands use different technology, and they don\u2019t always talk to each other.The chief appeal of Apple\u2019s HomeKit is that it\u2019s comparatively easy to set up and use. Devices are paired with your phone or tablet, in much the same way you\u2019d connect a Bluetooth headset or speaker, only with more steps. And the company\u2019s next software update, due this fall, will group all the controls on one screen, so you can run your whole house from a single app. The downside: HomeKit doesn\u2019t have as many accessories as some other systems do.But tricks like these take some know-how to set up and manage. And neither Apple nor Amazon makes the plugs, switches and sensors that their systems run, which is why these systems can be a technological patchwork. Some of the accessories communicate by Wi-Fi; others use Bluetooth, radio or electrical lines, or a combination.Once you\u2019ve installed and run a simple accessory, like an on/off switch, you should feel comfortable enough to try something a little more complicated.You might start by creating \u201cscenes,\u201d which send instructions to several devices with a single voice command. This can take some time to set up, as you have to tell the central control what you want each of the individual devices to do. But by issuing a simple command like \u201cLet\u2019s watch a movie,\u201d you could have the curtains close, the lights dim and the television and DVD player turn on.\u201cEvery hour on the hour, there is a new scene,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. And he didn\u2019t stop there. He created other scenes for watching television, listening to music, eating dinner \u2014 more than a dozen in all. \u201cAt this point,\u201d he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to a normal bulb.\u201dEven so, that\u2019s not enough, Mr. Dumas said. If you follow a predictable routine, he explained, \u201cAfter a few times, it should ask, \u2018We notice when you get home and it\u2019s dark out, you turn on the hallway light, then turn on ESPN; do you want us to do that?\u2019 \u201dBut that\u2019s easier said than done.\u201cIt\u2019s so simple to comprehend the internet of Things 2.0, and people think we are there, and we aren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Dumas said. \u201cWe are at 1.0, and there is a lot of value there, but 2.0 is where we need to go.\u201dMost of the smart home devices I tried were pretty simple to use. But the more I piled on the network, the glitchier things got. My suggestion: Stick with as few brands as possible or resign yourself to using some apps in lieu of voice control.Apple HomeKitAmazon EchoLutronElgatoPhilips HueAdvertisement"}

The frantic, pinwheeling center of \u201cBad Moms,\u201d she enters in heels at full speed, a pace she keeps up as she sprints from one demand to another, often with her two children in tow. Mr. Lucas and Mr. Moore, who both wrote and directed, keep Amy on the run for a while, playing her harried purposefulness against some gently disruptive sight gags: a giant head of Richard M. Nixon that she makes for a school project, a dog wearing a helmet, an office run by giant children. (Clark Duke plays her boss, while Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith and Annie Mumolo offer backup as the grown-up mean girls \u2014 i.e., the momsters.)The do-it-all mother might be a fantasy, but she\u2019s good for a laugh. She\u2019s also been good for sales. You could fill an entire Amazon fulfillment center with parenting books, with a few rows reserved for putatively bad or just guilt-ridden moms. These range from high-end reads like Allison Pearson\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Know How She Does It\u201d to down-market manuals with expletive-ridden titles, like one coyly subtitled \u201cThe Parenting Guide for the Rest of Us.\u201d (If a lot of these humor books seem to focus on mothers, it\u2019s probably because that\u2019s the way the world still turns, although you also have to wonder if stories about terrible fathers cut too queasily close to the bone for mass readership.)The comedy in \u201cBad Moms\u201d hinges on a rarer type: the good mother gone rogue, which here mostly involves kicking back, something Amy does after she boots out her cheating husband and stops coddling her kids. (They\u2019re forced to eat cold cereal. From a box.) The naturally likable Ms. Kunis, who has a screwball heroine\u2019s springiness and the eyes of Bambi under fire, helps humanize the story\u2019s mechanical turns, as do her gal pals, the neurotic, overachieving Kiki (Kristen Bell) and the sexed-up slacker Carla (Kathryn Hahn). If I could write sonnets, I would write one about Ms. Hahn, whose timing \u2014 she finds depths in that little pause before a joke crests \u2014 can turn laughs into howls.Carla aside, the movie\u2019s yuks are tame stuff. What makes \u201cBad Moms\u201d funny (aside from its lineup of gifted performers) isn\u2019t that Amy and her friends go wild; they don\u2019t, not even close. It\u2019s the women\u2019s shared, near-orgiastic pleasure in their freedom and friendship. In the most comically honed and sustained scene, Amy, Kiki and Carla run mild and a bit loony \u2014 and in slow motion \u2014 through a supermarket, where they rip open boxes, chug booze and (absurdly) terrorize a guard, their every offense turned into an epic of blissed-out destruction by the decelerated visuals. There\u2019s nothing genuinely transgressive about their behavior; they\u2019re just drunk, happy and together.\u201cBad Moms\u201d is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Venture capitalists have a special term for investment opportunities that offer the potential for a big return but also carry a great deal of risk: high beta. For Silicon Valley\u2019s political aspirations, Mr. Thiel\u2019s speech is the ultimate high-beta performance.On the one hand, an emissary from tech will have a national platform to push the industry\u2019s agenda and, more important, its worldview. By the end of Mr. Thiel\u2019s speech on Thursday night, it\u2019s possible he will have succeeded in showing off an ideology that is rarely encountered in public \u2014 the hands-off-my-stuff, techno-libertarian vision that is a hobbyhorse of Mr. Thiel and a few other Silicon Valley bigwigs.On the other hand, this could end quite badly.Here\u2019s how we analyzed the third night of the Republican National Convention, which featured Mike Pence, Ted Cruz and more.The danger, then, is that not only could Mr. Thiel\u2019s public embrace of Mr. Trump backfire on him, but it could also become another plot point in the larger story line that Silicon Valley is exclusionary and narrow-minded and that its innovations are advancing global inequality.What\u2019s more, the speech could spoil what had been growing areas of overlap between the Republicans and the tech industry. In the Obama years, much of Silicon Valley has become very close to Democrats. This year there was an opportunity for a Republican to make overtures to tech \u2014 but with Mr. Trump, that chance seems to have passed.\u201cWhere Trump has stood on immigration reform, or how he called for a boycott of Apple, or on a number of other issues, it almost seems like he\u2019s gone out of his way to smite Silicon Valley leaders on the issues they care about,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Silicon Valley Republican who has worked for several presidential campaigns, including Mitt Romney\u2019s and John McCain\u2019s. Mr. Harrison said he would vote this year for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential candidate.Mr. Harrison was one of the few Silicon Valley Republicans willing to chat openly about their options this year. Virtually every prominent Republican in the industry whom I called declined to comment or was willing to speak only anonymously about the strained connection between the tech industry and the Republican Party.Mr. Thiel, a billionaire known for his unusual positions, does not appear to be too bothered by kryptonite.

At $4.95 a month, it presents a lower-priced entry point to the service and significantly expands on Audible\u2019s core audiobook offering, while giving listeners more incentive to stick with the company.Channels will be free under Audible\u2019s traditional $14.95 monthly membership, which provides access to hundreds of thousands of programs and audiobooks.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious there\u2019s an audience for it, to us at least,\u201d said Eric Nuzum, who leads the Channels team and is a former vice president at National Public Radio.Roughly two out of five Audible customers listen to podcasts, he said.

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s $9.3 Billion Deal for NetSuite Will Bolster Its Cloud Offerings", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Evan M. Goldberg founded NetSuite in 1998, he did so with backing from his former boss, Lawrence J. Ellison, who started the software giant Oracle.On Thursday, their relationship came full circle as Oracle agreed to acquire NetSuite for $9.3 billion to beef up its cloud offerings.It made Oracle bigger, but it did not change its business model. About 5,000 PeopleSoft employees, close to half the company, were laid off in the following months.The NetSuite purchase, on the other hand, is at the heart of Oracle\u2019s fight to remake itself for the modern world of cloud computing, or providing accessing to vast computational resources over the internet. This transition has shaken up the software business for the last several years. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created markets worth billions, and older companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have struggled to change the way they make and sell their products.The deal also illustrates that, for all the reach and novelty of tech, Silicon Valley remains a very small place with long personal histories. Mr. Goldberg got the idea for NetSuite after conversations with Mr. Ellison about where else the internet might go. Down the hall was another rising star at Oracle, named Marc Benioff.Mr. Benioff started a company called Salesforce.com within weeks of NetSuite\u2019s start, also with backing from Mr. Ellison. Today, Salesforce is regarded as the leading company selling only cloud software, with a market capitalization of $55.7 billion.NetSuite\u2019s chief executive, Zachary Nelson, is a well-regarded leader who also worked at Oracle and is close to Mr. Ellison. NetSuite has held customer events at Mr. Ellison\u2019s Silicon Valley estate. He is likely to occupy a senior role at Oracle.Mr. Ellison, through personal and family holdings, owns more than 40 percent of NetSuite, which makes the deal to acquire it a phenomenal payday for a man who was already among the world\u2019s richest.NetSuite has more than 5,000 employees and specializes in accounting and other back-office e-commerce software, particularly for smaller businesses. It has also created online software for manufacturing that is akin to some of Oracle\u2019s software applications. But that online software is created, sold and serviced differently.Oracle has, for most of the last decade, bought cloud companies and spent big on remaking its engineering and sales staff for the cloud world. That has paid off some: In the last fiscal year, the company had $12.2 billion in core cloud software sales, an increase of 49 percent from fiscal 2014.That is enough to make Oracle one of the largest cloud companies, but it was still just 8 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Overall revenue shrank 3 percent last year, as demand for older products fell.It might have been worse. Giant tech companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard have endured sharp revenue drops as cloud computing becomes more important, and have struggled to cope in the new environment.Oracle has fared relatively well, in part because its core product, a powerful database used for financial and managerial work, is at the center of most major companies worldwide. Competitors are trying to sell more modern databases to replace Oracle, with relatively little success so far.\u201cOracle and NetSuite cloud applications are complementary, and will coexist in the marketplace forever,\u201d Mark Hurd, chief executive of Oracle, said in the statement.An Oracle special committee made up of independent directors led the process to sign a deal with NetSuite. The transaction is expected to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals and agreement by a majority of NetSuite\u2019s shareholders, not including shares owned by executives of NetSuite or anyone affiliated with Mr. Ellison.Shares of NetSuite surged to a level just below the deal price in early trading on Thursday and closed at $108.41.Advertisement"}

The proposal would significantly raise the rates that Spotify pays, and the filing includes lines that are clearly directed at Spotify and its so-called freemium model.\u201cAn interactive stream has an inherent value,\u201d Apple wrote, \u201cregardless of the business model a service provider chooses.\u201dA spokeswoman for Apple confirmed the filing but declined to comment further.Last month, Apple said that Apple Music had 15 million subscribers, and Spotify reported that it had 30 million paid users and another 70 million who listen free, with ads.Apple\u2019s filing was made as part of a proceeding by the Copyright Royalty Board to set statutory rates for downloads and interactive streaming services from 2018 to 2022. Spotify, Google, Pandora, Amazon and the Recording Industry Association of America were all expected to file their proposals by Friday, but the panel has not yet made the filings public.Although the bulk of Apple\u2019s proposal with the Copyright Royalty Board is confined to three brief paragraphs, it would have wide implications if it were adopted. Songwriting rates paid by interactive streaming services like Spotify are now governed by a byzantine system that includes a division between what are known as mechanical and performance royalties for the same songs. Apple\u2019s proposal would cover all songwriting royalties with the same rate. (Royalties for recordings are accounted separately.)Advertisement"}

K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter book series, which led to films and a theme park.Ms. Rowling has made it clear that \u201cCursed Child\u201d is not an eighth Harry Potter novel, but the fans do not care. The book topped the 2016 pre-order charts for Amazon\u2019s print and Kindle e-book sales, while also becoming Barnes & Noble\u2019s top pre-ordered book since \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d in 2007. Scholastic, the publisher in the United States, will not have sales figures until later this week.It has been nearly 20 years since the first book and almost 10 years since the publication of \u201cDeathly Hallows,\u201d what many have considered the final chapter in Ms. Rowling\u2019s story. And Mary Gannett, an owner of BookCourt, said she had not been sure the store should host a party this time.Interest trickled in slowly after the script\u2019s publication was announced in February, Ms. Gannett said, but in the past week, requests for reserved copies nearly doubled.In New York and across the country, so-called Potterheads swarmed bookstores Saturday night and into Sunday morning to celebrate the release, as if they had found the secret winged key that not only let them back into their childhoods but also opened the door to another generation.Judy Stelter, the manager of Book World in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., was expecting a smaller, older audience for the store\u2019s midnight party. Instead, she was greeted by teenagers and young children with their parents, who filled the small store to enjoy cake and chocolate frogs (a treat among wizards).\u201cLook at all the young kids in here,\u201d Ms. Stelter said, standing beside boxes of \u201cCursed Child.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in here for a book that\u2019s in print and on paper, not on an electric device. Once they read like that, they\u2019ll read for life.\u201dMany fans happily brought family members who were not old enough \u2014 or even born yet \u2014 for the celebrations of the original series.In Atlanta, Erin Whitlock, 24, brought her 12-year-old brother Liam to a Barnes & Noble in the Edgewood neighborhood.JillEllyn Riley, 48, a writer and editor who lives in Cobble Hill, perused the novels at BookCourt with her sons, ages 13 and 19, who did not seem to mind the spectacle of their mother dressed as Sybil Trelawney, a professor at Hogwarts. Ms. Riley said she hosted monthly Harry Potter club meetings in the neighborhood with her younger son.\u201cWe came here to BookCourt for Book 7, all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cMy 13-year-old was 3, and I knew that later he would read the books and wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the midnight releases, but I knew he\u2019d know he had been there once.\u201dAubrey Nolan, 25, who planned the evening at BookCourt, said she wanted to keep the activities family friendly. All around her, children sipped cream soda floats they passed off as butterbeer and decorated wands with paint, sequins and string. Others had mug shots taken that resembled the wizards imprisoned at Azkaban.Bookstores around the country embraced the theme, too, with Books of Wonder in Manhattan offering photos with owls (like Harry\u2019s Hedwig) and the Charles Deering Library at Northwestern University outside Chicago refereeing a Quidditch match, a sport played in the series.\u201cI\u2019m in the group that aged along with Harry,\u201d Mr. Lennon, 30, said. \u201cOne of the actresses says she\u2019ll probably be crying through it. I might too.\u201dFor some, nothing was more important than getting their hands on the newest edition, even if it meant waiting alone or interrupting a vacation.Annie Grandidge and Travis Dicks, tourists from New Castle, Australia, spent two and a half hours in line at the Barnes & Noble on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. And Ashley Johnson, 32, the actress who played Chrissy Seaver in the sitcom \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d recently moved to Brooklyn to work on NBC\u2019s \u201cBlindspot.\" She showed up at BookCourt by herself, knowing she would easily make friends with other Potter fans.\u201cI was a little angry that I didn\u2019t read these as I was growing up,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cI found them in my mid-20s and I never got to go wait in line for the original books, so to be a part of that I felt like I needed to go do it. We don\u2019t get to do this with a lot of things with how fast the world moves, and to wait in line for a book at midnight feels really special.\u201dMargaret Piraino, 24, dressed as Nymphadora Tonks, a half-blood witch, complete with rainbow hair and Potter-themed jewelry, attended the BookCourt party with her girlfriend, Laurel Detkin, a fellow Potter enthusiast. But this time was different.\u201cI grew up with Harry Potter and it\u2019s been my entire life, and my dad would go to Barnes & Noble with me every time there was a new release,\u201d Ms. Piraino, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said. \u201cAnd this year, my dad died in January and it\u2019s the first time I had to go on my own.\u201dIn Seattle, Dylan Blanford, 13, donned a long black robe and a yellow tie as a member of Hufflepuff, one of the four houses at Hogwarts, and said he was jealous that he was not at parties for the previous Harry Potter books. He started reading the books at age 5.\u201cI\u2019m excited because there\u2019s still this little 6-year-old jumping around inside of me going, \u2018Harry! Harry!

Thanks to everyone who told us what they want to see. We received more than 2,500 emails.All over California, communities are grappling with a shortage of affordable housing.Is Airbnb part of the problem?The company is increasingly at odds with local governments in the state.Airbnb has resisted, accusing officials of overreaching.Now, Airbnb is in a legal battle with its hometown, San Francisco, which has brought up wrenching questions about inequality, neighborhood change and the free market.Founded inside a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a major local success story.But Airbnb has also become a focal point for anger at the tech industry \u2014 even more so than the Google buses that bring workers to jobs in Silicon Valley.Short-term rentals in San Francisco are being blamed, at least in part, for rising rents that are driving out longtime residents.Last year, Airbnb spent more than $8 million to defeat a ballot measure that would have limited rentals to no more than 75 nights a year.Last month, San Francisco supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that would fine Airbnb $1,000 per day for each host listed on its website who is not registered with the city.\u201cThis legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb,\u201d the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s this very visible sign of the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just of gentrification, but of how wide the disparity is between people who have opportunities and people who don\u2019t.\u201dWhen questioned by reporters about the state budget, which he signed this week, Governor Brown responded with a parable, Aesop\u2019s \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper.\u201dAesop, an ancient Greek fabulist, \u201chas some credibility,\u201d Mr. Brown said.That was one of the governor\u2019s less obscure literary references.Since returning to Sacramento in 2011 for a second stint as governor, he has quoted poets, religious scholars and biologists.He invoked the book of Genesis, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a king of Spain and \u201cThe Little Engine That Could\u201d all in the same 2013 speech.\u201cOver the mountain the little engine went \u2014 we are going to get over that mountain,\u201d he said, making an analogy to California\u2019s high-speed rail plan after quoting the children\u2019s book.The unusual source material has perplexed some analysts.But his literary breadth may also help reinforce his image as a wise, old \u2014 well, experienced (he\u2019s 78) \u2014 politician, who will keep his party\u2019s impulses to spend in check.During a speech last year about climate change, Mr. Brown said proudly that he was among the last politicians with a classics degree.\u201cIt does come in handy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause some of the same mistakes have been made over and over again.\u201dCalifornia Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.Advertisement"}

It Could Be Seattle", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside an office in this city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby.There\u2019s more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle\u2019s abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.\u201cThe reason for it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don\u2019t seem to want to move to L.A.\u201d\u201cAbandoned in Place,\u201d a new book of photographs by Roland Miller, finds haunting beauty in derelict launch pads, rusting towers and other detritus of the American space race.One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun\u2019s energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won\u2019t say how much they\u2019ve invested.\u201cMany of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,\u201d said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s director of marketing and business development.Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in which Boeing is based. It is Chicago, not Seattle. (Though the company moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001, about half of its workforce is still in Seattle.)Advertisement"}

Though it may resemble standard political fare, the new media start-up responsible for the program \u2014 Studio 2016 \u2014 is an in-house production unit run by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.The creation of a team to produce original content that resembles news coverage is the latest attempt by a presidential candidate to bypass major news networks and speak directly to voters. By harnessing social media platforms to distribute hours of live video to hundreds of millions of potential followers, the Clinton campaign is poised to deliver a convention message more fully under its control.\u201cEverything we do for the convention, this four-day sprint, is about trying to bring people in, trying to engage people, trying to speak directly to them,\u201d said Teddy Goff, the campaign\u2019s chief digital strategist.Advances in technology, especially in live, high-definition streaming video, have allowed campaigns to reach people who may not be tuning in to network coverage. Just four years ago, social networks like Twitter and Facebook offered what digital specialists called a \u201csecond-screen experience.\u201d Watching a convention speech typically required a standard television set, and apps on smartphones or computers were mostly used to react on social networks.Now, viewers \u2014 and not just young ones \u2014 can ditch the television entirely and watch the convention on a smaller, portable screen. That provides an opportunity that political campaigns are seizing to connect directly with voters without having to suffer through analysis and criticism from journalists and pundits.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cPart of what you want to do is shape the conversation that\u2019s happening, and you want to give tools to your supporters to spread the message,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama who used similar approaches while he was in the White House.\u201cYou want to expose it to as many people as possible, either in the moment or afterward, with context that you provide,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said.Republicans, too, have seized on live video as a tool for shaping their message. In Cleveland, the Republicans offered all of the convention speeches over the major social media networks. Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign organized live video from backstage, some of it delivered on Snapchat and other social networks.\u201cLess and less people are watching live television,\u201d said Sam Osborne, the digital director for the Republican National Convention. Politicians who do not use live video delivered on phones and tablets, he said, \u201cwill not get your message out to the people that you need to reach.\u201dThe idea for the Democrats\u2019 show built off a one-hour show that they produced at the convention four years ago, hosted by the actor Kal Penn of the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d movies. Laura Olin, a Democratic digital strategist, said the video show was cutting-edge at the time. This year, instead of just one hour of programming, there will be four days of content.\u201cIt will be at a level that we have never seen before,\u201d Ms. Olin said.The difference largely has to do with vast advances in technology, networks and social media apps. Facebook and Twitter have overhauled their apps to focus on live video, and other companies that focus on using video, like Snapchat, have emerged in recent years.Facebook introduced Facebook Live this year, and has partnered with campaigns and news media organizations to produce content. For the conventions, the company is using the live-streams of news outlets and the parties held during the events as a way of bringing the programming of the conventions to users\u2019 screens.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that often people are tweeting as they watch something on TV, so the hope is this is one experience,\u201d said Nick Pacilio, a Twitter spokesman.The presidential campaigns have fully embraced digital media as a central part of their messaging and organizing strategy. In June, at a senior-level planning meeting at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn, members of the digital team almost jokingly proposed an online contest to select a constituent to have a role at the Democratic convention. The campaign\u2019s top strategists immediately agreed.The campaign has also invited celebrity supporters to use social media as an organizing tool in a nationwide effort to register three million voters. And Mr. Goff said the campaign was using its digital media presence to bolster its collection of email addresses and other valuable information about voters.Smartphones, and the extensive use of social media by campaigns to communicate directly with voters, often provide a view into places that previously would have gone unseen because of limited access of the news media, especially at conventions. Instagram\u2019s Backstage Portrait Studio at both conventions captures the final moments before a speaker, or eventually the candidate, takes the stage.And Snapchat has proved unusually adept at gaining behind-the-scenes access at closed-door events like fund-raisers. Delegates, campaign aides and convention officials used the platform at the Republican convention, and the company expects the same among Democrats in Philadelphia.For those who attend the conventions in person, the most prominent social media platforms have been at least as visible as the broadcast television and cable networks.The bright royal blue hue of Facebook dominated large spaces in the convention hall and news media filing centers, providing coffee, snacks and real-time data for journalists and, for delegates and convention attendees, hands-on trials of the company\u2019s virtual reality product Oculus. Facebook also built a studio adjacent to the arena to allow its news partners, including The New York Times, to produce live segments.Twitter has booths scattered around the convention site, but is also focusing offsite. As it did last week in Cleveland, the company is renting out restaurants and event spaces to host meetings and panel discussions on the platform\u2019s role in the election, with topics like #BlackTwitter and women in politics.But for the Clinton campaign, the goal of these efforts is to reach an audience well beyond Philadelphia.A campaign spokesman said that what he called \u201cgavel-to-gavel coverage\u201d of the convention would be distributed to viewers on Apple TV, Amazon Fire and Roku, in addition to Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.Mr. Goff said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategists were not ignoring the traditional broadcast and cable networks. But he noted that 2014 was the first year that Americans, in aggregate, had spent more time in front of their smartphone screens than they did in front of their television screens.\u201cTV is still really important,\u201d Mr. Goff said. \u201cBut things are changing really quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Books Recount How Our Postal System Created a Communications Revolution", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byNonfictionIn 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville celebrated the American postal system as a marvel of its day \u2014 a \u201cgreat link between minds.\u201d According to Devin Leonard, it may soon vanish. Drenched in red ink, the United States Postal Service has shut offices, reduced opening hours, closed processing plants and slashed its work force. While Leonard\u2019s diagnosis of the United States mail as a \u201cdying institution\u201d may be premature (the Postal Service is still America\u2019s largest civilian employer after Walmart), the system is clearly in crisis.Leonard\u2019s \u201cNeither Snow Nor Rain\u201d and Winifred Gallagher\u2019s \u201cHow the Post Office Created America\u201d celebrate the mail system\u2019s storied past, and chart its declining fortunes. Gallagher, a journalist whose earlier books often focused on behavior science, emphasizes the achievements that made the postal system a crucial American institution. Present in every community and known to every citizen, the service was an obvious marker of the federal government in an era when centralized governance was largely out of sight.Her book is the work of an enthusiast, an ode to a little-heralded but flagship government enterprise. In contrast to the British Royal Post, which, before mid-19th-century reforms, served primarily as a channel of official government correspondence, the United States mail, she tells us, was republican at birth. For example, the Post Office Act of 1792 in effect subsidized newspaper circulation, spreading national and international news to far-flung states and making for an informed citizenry. She reminds us, echoing the historian Richard John, that the post office forged a communications revolution just as far-reaching as the later telegraph and internet revolutions. But these public channels of communication could deepen division as well as foster unity, which both Northerners and Southerners knew. In 1802, at the behest of slaveholders who feared free blacks would use the system to foster slave rebellion, Congress barred nonwhites from carrying the mail. Abolitionists, in turn, flooded the South with antislavery literature. After Charleston pro-slavery citizens broke into the local post office in 1835 and burned the mail, the postmaster general sanctioned the suppression of abolitionist mailings to the South, the first in a series of government actions limiting the free exchange of information through the post office.Gallagher glosses over such controversies to present an almost mythic vision of the past, particularly the nation\u2019s westward expansion. She tells us of the post office\u2019s crucial role in moving information across great distances, and in forging a national presence in Western territories. In the process, however, she simplifies the history of cultural exchange, diplomacy, violence, expropriation and warfare in a West that was, however inconveniently, already settled. In framing Western expansion as a story of \u201cperipatetic Americans\u201d who \u201cfled farming and civilization for a wild life in an unspoiled natural world,\u201d she ignores generations of historians who have told a more complex story of settler colonial capitalism, and its tragic meaning for the indigenous populations.Gallagher\u2019s discussion of the postal system\u2019s \u201cGolden Age\u201d during the Progressive Era is more convincing. Flexible and innovative, with rural free delivery and the popular new parcel post service, the post office stood as a \u201cpowerful counter to the argument that private industry always serves Americans better than the government.\u201d The Populists revered the American postal system. It stood as a model of how large-scale, bureaucratic and publicly controlled institutions could modernize the nation and make it more equitable. They hoped to establish a postal banking system, and to extend public ownership over the telegraph, the telephone and the railroads. The government did authorize postal banks, but only in regions underserved by established banks, and for very small savings accounts. Private stakeholders fought against a more robust postal banking system.Such battles between private interests and the postal system were as old as the service itself, and Devin Leonard, a staff writer at Bloomberg Businessweek, recounts many of them. His sweeping and entertaining history tells a less celebratory if no less colorful story than \u00adGallagher, but he offers a host of interesting anecdotes, including one about an \u00adIdaho family who sent their child 75 miles by parcel post because it was cheaper than going by train. More incidents of \u201cchild mailing\u201d led the post office to outlaw the practice. Leonard sometimes presents his historical actors via dialogue, an unusual choice for a history book, and a method that must have involved some creative reconstruction on his part.Over all, Leonard emphasizes a darker side of postal history, from the corruption scandals that periodically erupted after Andrew Jackson politicized the service, creating a gargantuan patronage machine, to oppressive government censorship campaigns. He devotes much of a chapter to Anthony Comstock, the longtime postal inspector and self-styled \u201cweeder in God\u2019s garden,\u201d who banned and prosecuted the mailing of birth control pamphlets, \u201cmarriage aids\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d literary works like Walt Whitman\u2019s poems, lest they pollute public morals. Still another chapter charts the spree of mass killings by overworked, underpaid and aggrieved postal workers in the 1980s and early 1990s.Despite their different emphases, both books present a narrative of decline. In the mid-20th century, the post office was a powerful institution, the lifeblood of commerce, with mail carriers delivering letters twice daily. But because of repeated bare-bones congressional appropriations, the service has been unable to modernize, and mounting volume in outdated facilities has resulted in chaos, inefficiency and dysfunction. In 1967, after Postmaster General Lawrence O\u2019Brien declared the department to be in a \u201crace with catastrophe\u201d and proposed a new model, business interests succeeded in winning a seat at the table for planning its future. In 1970 Richard Nixon\u2019s Postal Reorganization Act ended a more than century-long understanding of the post as a public service paid for from general revenues and turned it into a government corporation.Lack of modernization and continued inefficiency opened the door for private express carriers. When the Postal Service argued that such companies infringed on its monopoly over letter delivery, lobbyists fought back, and legislators proved receptive, eroding the service\u2019s \u00addominance in commerce and business. Experiments with computerized mail delivery, a postal email service and methods to help customers pay bills online were all slapped down by powerful opposition from private stakeholders and Congress. In 2006, Congress hemmed in the Postal Service\u2019s mandate to its core mission: delivering letters, packages and printed matter, constraining its ability to innovate in a digital age. In many European countries, by contrast, national postal systems have so far weathered the internet revolution by innovating and offering digital services. And Congress dealt the Postal Service another blow by forcing it to prepay its future retiree health care costs at the hefty price of $5.5 billion a year for 10 years, deepening its woes.Is the Postal Service, once at the cutting edge of a communications revolution, doomed to become either a quaint relic of the past or a de facto subsidiary of Amazon? The answer depends upon the public and Congress\u2019s willingness to reorient policy. Gallagher\u2019s and Leonard\u2019s reminders of a time when the post office department stood at the center of commerce and communication suggest that innovation and experimentation \u2014 a hallmark of the Postal Service at its apex \u2014 may be the best way to secure the system\u2019s future in an age of instant communication. Perhaps the post office is the place to begin the revitalization \u2014 or reinvention \u2014 of America\u2019s ailing public sector.NEITHER SNOW NOR RAINA History of the United States Postal Service By Devin LeonardIllustrated. 316 pp. Grove Press. $26.HOW THE POST OFFICE CREATED AMERICAA History By Winifred Gallagher Illustrated. 326 pp. Penguin Press. $28.Lisa McGirr teaches American history at Harvard.

{"Headline": "Justice Department Won\u2019t Alter Music Industry Royalty Rules", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byThe music industry sent a wish list to Washington, but the response was not quite what it had expected.Two years ago, Ascap and BMI, the industry\u2019s two giant licensing clearinghouses, petitioned the Justice Department for changes to the regulatory agreements that have governed them since 1941. Those documents have not been changed in at least 15 years and, the agencies said, were in desperate need of updating to preserve the value of music in the digital age. The request came after both groups went through bruising litigation with Pandora Media over royalty rates.But this week the government told the agencies it planned to deny their request, and added a twist that songwriters and industry executives say could further damage the economics of music and perhaps unsettle the business in fundamental ways.In a meeting in Washington on Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers told representatives of Ascap and BMI that the two groups, called performing rights organizations, must adopt a policy known as \u201c100 percent licensing,\u201d which means that any party that controls a part of a composition can issue a license for the use of the whole thing. This went against decades of industry practice.Although the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation carries great weight, any alterations to the consent decrees is subject to approval by two federal judges overseeing the cases, and the performing rights organizations could object to the changes in court.Music publishers said that instituting 100 percent licensing would further depress royalty rates by letting outlets like radio stations and digital music services shop for whatever party would accept the lowest fee. It would also cause administrative pandemonium, at least in the short term, they said, and cast doubt on the futures of Ascap and BMI, two of the music world\u2019s most stable institutions, together processing more than $2 billion a year in licensing fees.\u201cTheir decision is like Brexit,\u201d said Martin Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV, the largest publisher. \u201cNo one understands it.\u201dThe Justice Department\u2019s meeting with Ascap and BMI was confirmed by those organizations, which issued a brief joint statement on Thursday saying that they were \u201cevaluating the information presented.\u201d The regulators are expected to meet with publishers and digital music services next week and issue a public decision by the end of July, according to several people briefed on the talks who were not authorized to speak about them. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.The decision, if upheld by the courts, could have consequences for songwriters. Those who work alone and control their intellectual property would gain an advantage. Major pop hits now tend to involve many songwriters, but the ranks of credited writers could be thinned to limit the number of people who could potentially license the work, publishing executives said.It could also mean that musicians would be forced to change their writing habits based on the professional affiliations of their collaborators, said Michelle Lewis, a songwriter whose work has been recorded by pop stars like Cher and Jessica Simpson, and who is a founder of the advocacy group Songwriters of North America.\u201cYou write with who you have chemistry with; their choice of P.R.O. should not figure into it,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut if we have to deal with this administrative nightmare we are not going to collaborate. I don\u2019t think the D.O.J. really understood this.\u201dWhen the Justice Department indicated last year that it was considering 100 percent licensing, it caused an uproar in the industry. In January, Maria A. Pallante, the register of copyrights and the director of the United States Copyright Office, wrote a 30-page memo saying that the practice \u201cwould seemingly vitiate important principles of copyright law.\u201dYet the Justice Department\u2019s position on 100 percent licensing has been endorsed by technology companies, which have long argued that the music industry charges onerous fees for use of their material. In a federal rate-setting trial two years ago involving Ascap and Pandora, a judge also warned that Ascap and music publishers had shown a \u201ctroubling coordination\u201d in how they operate, giving fuel to technology companies\u2019 complaints about the music industry.\u201cCongress is clear in the Copyright Act that each individual co-writer is authorized to license the whole,\u201d said Gregory Barnes, the general counsel of the Digital Media Association, a trade group that includes tech giants like Pandora, Amazon and Google. \u201cCongress created that rule to promote efficiency.\u201dIn the past, major music publishers like Universal and Sony/ATV have said they will withdraw their works entirely from Ascap and BMI if the consent decrees are not changed to their satisfaction, but it was not clear on Thursday whether they would follow through. Mr. Bandier said that Sony/ATV was still coming to grips with the situation.Elizabeth Matthews, the chief executive of Ascap, said her organization was \u201cdisappointed and frustrated,\u201d and considering \u201clegal and legislative remedies.\u201d\u201cAn approach that creates confusion, chaos and instability in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Matthews said, \u201cis detrimental to all creators, publishers and music users.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Beanbag Chairs. Amazon Is Giving Its Workers Treehouses.", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byNo, Amazon is growing actual plants, more than 3,000 species of them spread around a one-acre greenhouse a half-hour\u2019s drive from Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle. There are carnivorous pitcher plants, exotic philodendrons and orchids from Ecuador that resemble the menacing flora from \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d\u201cCinnamon, wax candy and baby powder,\u201d said Ron Gagliardo, the Amazon horticulturist who oversees the greenhouse, when asked to describe the mysterious scent of the orchid, called Anguloa virginalis.Amazon pioneered internet shopping, electronic book reading and cloud computing. Now, as it enters adulthood, it is applying some of that inventiveness to its new home. The company is constructing a collection of high-rise and low-rise buildings in downtown Seattle that will be arrayed around three striking transparent, conjoined structures that Amazon calls spheres. They will act as high-tech greenhouses, the kind of flashy architecture that Amazon shunned for the first 22 years of its life.The real point of the spheres is how Amazon wants to use the nature on the inside to inspire employees. When they open in early 2018, the spheres will be packed with a plant collection worthy of top-notch conservatories, allowing Amazon employees to amble through tree canopies three stories off the ground, meet with colleagues in rooms with walls made from vines and eat kale Caesar salads next to an indoor creek.Since Amazon decided about a decade ago to stay in downtown Seattle, the company said, it has invested over $4 billion in the construction and development of offices in the city, though it won\u2019t disclose the budget for the spheres. The spheres will be accessible to Amazon employees only, but the company may eventually allow public tours.\u201cThe whole idea was to get people to think more creatively, maybe come up with a new idea they wouldn\u2019t have if they were just in their office,\u201d said Dale Alberda, the lead architect on the project at NBBJ, a firm that has also worked on building projects for Samsung, Google and the Chinese internet company Tencent.What makes Amazon\u2019s project unusual is its location \u2014 in the heart of a city, rather than on a sprawling suburban campus of the sort favored by most other big tech companies. Amazon, the largest private employer in Seattle, has more than 20,000 employees spread out in more than 30 buildings in the city. Its current construction plans will give it the space to more than double its local head count.Mr. Bezos has said that Amazon is staying put in a city because the kinds of employees it wants are attracted to an urban environment. But the concrete and steel canyons around Amazon\u2019s new downtown properties do not have a lot of greenery. That is where the spheres and Mr. Gagliardo, whom Amazon hired to fill them with plants, enter the picture.Margaret O\u2019Mara, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington, sees the spheres as a kind of Walden Pond under glass. \u201cIt\u2019s a retreat, a cathedral away from the hubbub of the city,\u201d she said.There was plenty of noise inside the spheres on a recent tour, as workers welded steel, pounded bolts into place and sawed concrete inside the half-built structure. The glass panels that make up the carapace of the spheres were being lowered onto steel supports in eye-catching shapes.Wearing a hard hat, Mr. Gagliardo dodged power cords and scaffolding, surveying an enormous mass of concrete where a five-story living wall \u2014 fabric pockets filled with plants \u2014 will eventually be installed. He pointed to where a glass roof panel will be removed and a 45-foot fig tree will be lifted by crane into one of the spheres, one of 40 to 50 trees that will be installed.\u201cBeing able to walk through here, I\u2019m starting to see where things are going to go,\u201d he said.The spheres will have meeting areas called treehouses, and suspension bridges high off the ground that will be just wobbly enough to quicken the pulses of employees who walk over them. \u201cAmazon said, \u2018Make this fun,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Alberda, the architect.Amazon\u2019s architects had to make the spheres welcoming for both plants and people, a space with the abundance of a conservatory but without the stickiness that will fog MacBook screens and make people sweat.During the day, Amazon will keep the spheres at 72 degrees and 60 percent humidity, while at night the temperature will average 55 degrees and the humidity 85 percent, which Mr. Gagliardo said would be optimal for the cloud forest plant specimens it has collected.A growing body of academic research points to the benefits of giving employees access to nature. About a decade ago, Ihab Elzeyadi, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, conducted a study in which workers who were provided with a view of nature experienced a 20 percent reduction in sick leave from their employer, though it was not clear why that happened.Dr. Elzeyadi said he was intrigued by Amazon\u2019s sphere project, but not convinced it would be as effective as letting workers gaze at plants from their desks.\"You\u2019re making a big investment and betting on two big hypotheses,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they leave work and go there and, having that kind of nature-bathing maybe once a week, will it really impact their stress levels?\u201dUntil plants start moving into the spheres next spring, Mr. Gagliardo, 50, dotes on them in their temporary home in the huge greenhouse Amazon has been leasing for the last couple of years. He will continue to tend to the plants for Amazon after they are planted in the spheres.He stops by a welwitschia, a Namibian plant with two leaves, proclaiming it the \u201cugliest plant in the world\u201d and delivering the line with such enthusiasm that it sounds like a compliment. With misters pumping water into the air, he swells with excitement discussing his current love affair with a group of begonias from Southeast Asia.\u201cNext week I\u2019ll be more excited about a different group,\u201d he said.Many of the species Amazon is growing here are endangered or extinct in the wild, acquired from botanical gardens, universities and private growers around the world. Mr. Gagliardo, who previously worked at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and in amphibian conservation, said opportunities to build a plant collection like Amazon\u2019s did not come along often.\u201cI\u2019m a plant curator by heart,\u201d he said. \u201cSo different plant families, amassing a collection of plants, is totally what I geek out on and go crazy about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He is also uncle to the actress Talia Shire, and great-uncle to the actors Nicolas Cage and Jason and Robert Schwartzman, and the filmmakers Sofia and Roman Coppola.Creatively, the maestro is every bit as active as his younger relatives. Besides holding opera rehearsals and master classes, he spends his days composing and arranging in longhand, in the Central Park West apartment he has shared since 1956 with his wife, Almerinda.Mr. Coppola, a lifelong New Yorker, works at a card table with folding legs by a window overlooking Central Park and Tavern on the Green. He writes out his ideas on long pages, his baby grand piano next to him.The park provides inspiration. Last month, he wrote an ode to a tree, \u201cThe Tree and Me,\u201d and as with many of his compositions, sent it to his nephew Francis, with whom he has kept in frequent contact. This includes visits to the filmmaker\u2019s Napa wineries and the resort he opened in Bernalda, Italy, their ancestral hometown.\u201cForget four-star \u2014 this is 10-star,\u201d Anton Coppola said on Wednesday in his apartment. \u201cYou just have to think you want a cup of coffee, and the staff will bring it to you.\u201dWit, wisdom and wisecracks pour out of Mr. Coppola along with the music.On Wednesday, he was completing a song for a performance he plans to conduct in March with the Opera Tampa, of which he was the conductor and artistic director until he retired in 2012.The program will include his alternate ending for the Puccini opera \u201cTurandot\u201d and a selection from his 2001 opera, \u201cSacco and Vanzetti,\u201d about the Italian immigrant anarchists executed in 1927 in Massachusetts.His tree song will be played as an encore, he said.\u201cThere will be several encores \u2014 I guarantee it,\u201d he said.In the 1990s, Francis Ford Coppola had asked Anton to write music for a television special he was planning on Sacco and Vanzetti. The director shelved the show but said of the music, \u201cUncle, you\u2019ve got an opera here,\u201d recalled Anton, who took the advice.\u201cBy then, I was pregnant with the piece, and I couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.These days, he sticks to composing shorter works. \u201cMy wife would kill me if I started another opera, at this point,\u201d he said.Mr. Coppola said he grew up mostly in East Harlem, one of seven brothers.

{"Headline": "Oliver P\u00f6tzsch: German Author Finds International Success on Amazon", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported bySpotlightThe international success of \u201cThe Hangman\u2019s Daughter\u201d series has made Mr. P\u00f6tzsch a curiosity of the publishing world and has led to many more books across a variety of genres. His latest, \u201cThe Castle of Kings,\u201d published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is set during the German Peasants\u2019 War of the 16th century. It features an iconoclastic noblewoman with a flair for falconry. In this edited interview, Mr. P\u00f6tzsch discusses the pitfalls of different literary genres and how his international literary fame hasn\u2019t always followed him home to Germany. What is it like, as a German author, to have achieved more success abroad than at home?When I went first to the U.S. on a book tour, they had a really big car in the airport to pick me up. They brought me to this fancy hotel with a rooftop pool. I said to myself, \u201cThey think I\u2019m a star! I will not correct them.\u201d In Germany, it\u2019s not at all the case. I come home and my wife tells me to take out the rubbish.Your first books were inspired by your ancestors, who belonged to a storied dynasty of executioners. You discovered their social standing in German society was more complicated than one might imagine.Absolutely. Executioners were not only these bad guys that we know from the movies. They had a very important social status in medieval towns. They were not only killers but also healers, which is almost forgotten. Poor villagers wouldn\u2019t go to physicians \u2014 because they couldn\u2019t afford them and also because they didn\u2019t trust them. They would sometimes go to the barbers but more often would go to the executioners because they knew that executioners had experience with bodies. They would open bodies after the execution, look inside, study the organs. This is why many executioner dynasties \u2014 like my own family \u2014 ended up becoming physicians.Nevertheless, I imagine that your family and others encountered some stigma.It was considered bad luck just to meet the executioner on the street. That\u2019s why they wore masks \u2014just even a glimpse of his eye could bring you bad luck. They were not allowed to baptize their children. They were not allowed to bury their dead in the graveyard. But it wasn\u2019t as though they could pursue another career \u2014 they had no choice. If you were born into a family of executioners, you couldn\u2019t say, \u201cDaddy, I don\u2019t like blood. I want to be a writer instead.\u201d This was your job; you had to do it. And this is the reason why there were so many dynasties of executioners, like my ancestors. They married each other all the time because no one else would want them!By now you\u2019ve written books across several genres: historical fiction, mystery, young adult. What do you think of all these different labels?I know why the publishing industry uses them but I\u2019m not sure it always works. For me, the most important thing is the story. For my most recent book in Germany, which won\u2019t be published in the U.S., I had some real arguments with my publisher about genre. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d They asked me. \u201cHistorical fiction? Mystery? Maybe you should write something else.\u201d This kind of thing is hard for writers. Interestingly, the labels they use are not the same in every country. My next book, which will come out in October in the United States, was published in Germany as a classical young adult book, intended for 14-year-old boys. But in the States, it\u2019s being published as a book for readers of all ages. And if you looked at the American and German covers, you\u2019d think they\u2019re two entirely different books.Advertisement"}

We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential.I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not.Notice how today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses.Yahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed.I will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers.Problem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn\u2019t the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully.It\u2019s probably more nuanced than this, but we\u2019re out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog. Till next week, Falco! I mean, Farhad!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sukhinder Singh Cassidy: Either You Manage Me or I Manage You", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byCorner OfficeQ. What were your early years like?I remember hating going to Brownies, and I always felt slightly out of sorts there, so I quit. But then I locked myself in the bathroom at home and cried. And my mom asked, \u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d It was from feeling guilty that I quit. Ultimately I went back and finished Brownies and did a year of Girl Guides, and then I quit.Why did you go back if you didn\u2019t like it?It was conscientiousness and guilt from not having followed through on something. It was feeling that if I\u2019m going to quit, I can\u2019t quit this way. I still think of myself as a conscientious person.Tell me about your parents.They\u2019re both doctors, and my father loved running his medical practice as a business.Early on, he taught us all how to do his ledgers and his income taxes. I was doing his income taxes when I was about 10 or 11, and then as a teenager I built a system to do his ledgers on the computer.He always would say to me when I was young, \u201cYou should work for yourself.\u201d By the time I was about 25, I wanted to start a business.It seems you were driven from an early age.I\u2019m just wired that way. If anything, I wish there were days I could dial down my intensity. I\u2019ve always wanted to do more.And my parents were always highly conscientious. Their work ethic was incredible. They immigrated to Canada when they were older and had to restart their medical careers.What were your college years like?Interestingly, college was my revolt period after growing up in a highly conservative household. So when I went away to college, I was going to have a good time. My grades were good, but I was mostly enjoying the freedom to make my own choices.Your first job was on Wall Street. Was your compass always pointed there?My compass was not pointed anywhere. Interestingly, for somebody who was so intense, I actually didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I went through a recruiting cycle after graduating but didn\u2019t get a job. So I went from feeling great about myself as a high school student to wondering what\u2019s wrong with me. I felt pretty demoralized. It really made me question myself. Then I interviewed at Merrill Lynch, and the hiring process went really fast.So now I tell college grads, you\u2019re going to end up where you\u2019re supposed to be. In hindsight, why did Merrill work? In some ways, it\u2019s very clear. I\u2019m aggressive; Merrill is aggressive. I\u2019m intense; Merrill is intense. I don\u2019t come wrapped up in this nice neat bow, and so why was I surprised that the more conservative places didn\u2019t hire me?You have worked at a lot of companies, including Google, Amazon, BSkyB. It seems you like new challenges.I\u2019ve learned that my risk tolerance is high. Partly it comes from having had to figure out that time after college when I was having trouble getting hired. And then it finally worked.I always say to people, once you realize you\u2019re employable, everything else is O.K. I\u2019m always willing to let go of something before the next thing shows up because I have the sense that I could put food on the table.The other part of it is that I\u2019m very impatient. Whenever I think I\u2019m stagnating and not going to get where I\u2019m meant to go, I have this anxiety. So the anxiety of not getting there overwhelms the fear of uncertainty. So I guess I just trade one fear for another. People see that as risk tolerance, but it\u2019s more this sense that I\u2019m supposed to contribute something more or learn something more.Early leadership lessons?I\u2019ve learned to have a little bit of distance from the people I manage, and I don\u2019t feel the need that they all need to be at my house for dinner every weekend. On the other hand, I feel they\u2019re pretty sure that I am emotionally committed to them and emotionally invested in making them successful. When people feel you\u2019re all in on the company and on them, they will forgive a lot of imperfections and errors. It\u2019s really about authenticity.I also have this philosophy now, which I tell my team all the time, of, \u201cEither you manage me or I manage you. Which would you prefer?\u201dI like to give people a lot of rope. I like to see what they can do, but I also have an amazing capacity for detail. I know what they said they were going to do, and if they\u2019re not doing it, what\u2019s happening? Then I\u2019m starting to pull the rope back.And if I\u2019m starting to manage your time, you\u2019re not at your best, and I\u2019m not at my best. Because when I\u2019m managing your time with the opinions I have, I\u2019m going to start telling you what to do, right? I\u2019d rather bring my vision collaboratively with somebody else\u2019s vision. But if you show up with no vision, you\u2019re going to walk out with my vision, which I don\u2019t think is a very empowering place to be.How do you hire?I love really smart people, but I love really smart people who are focused on the good of the company before themselves. That gets my respect like nothing else. It\u2019s a unique combination to find somebody who is so capable and smart, but has some level of humility about their place in the entire ecosystem. I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of people who are really smart, but it\u2019s all about them. And that\u2019s a very frustrating place for me.I also always ask people what drains their energy, and what gives them energy. That tells me a lot about what people like to do and what they\u2019re good at.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\u2019 Goes From Stage to Page on Saturday at the Witching Hour", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThe biggest book of the summer isn\u2019t a blockbuster thriller or a splashy celebrity memoir. It\u2019s a play about a middle-aged wizard.The publication of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d the eighth installment in J. K. Rowling\u2019s best-selling series, is being celebrated at more than 5,000 bookstores and libraries across the country this weekend, with midnight release parties featuring costume contests, magic shows, wizard rock bands, live owls and butterbeer, the beverage of choice among young wizards.The elaborate rollout has all the flourishes that fans have come to expect for a new Harry Potter book. But for many nostalgic readers, this one feels different. \u201cCursed Child\u201d is not a new novel, but a script of a play \u2014 a format that typically isn\u2019t read for pleasure and almost never produces overnight best sellers. And unlike the previous seven books in the series, it was not written by Ms. Rowling herself.The idea for the play, which explores Harry\u2019s life as an adult and parent, didn\u2019t originate with Ms. Rowling, either: She merely agreed to it when two theater producers proposed the concept.Which raises a sticky question: If Ms. Rowling didn\u2019t conceive the play, or write it, is \u201cCursed Child\u201d really a new Harry Potter story by J. K. Rowling? And if it isn\u2019t, do Harry Potter fans even care?Many, apparently, do not.But other Potter fans are skeptical, arguing that a story that didn\u2019t spring from Ms. Rowling\u2019s imagination just isn\u2019t the same.Some will skip it altogether. Sharanya Sharma, an elementary school teacher in Washington who fell under Harry Potter\u2019s spell when she was 9, said she was satisfied when the series ended with \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\u201d\u201cI worry that it would negatively affect my memories of what Harry Potter meant to me when I was growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I go back and reread Harry Potter as a nostalgic experience, and I\u2019m not sure I want to ruin that.\u201dThe fans\u2019 fervor has been steadily fed by a stream of blockbuster movies, theme parks, new short stories about the wizarding world released on Pottermore, and now, \u201cCursed Child,\u201d which picks up with a scene from the epilogue in \u201cDeathly Hallows,\u201d as a grown-up Harry watches his own sons depart for Hogwarts.Still, \u201cCursed Child\u201d \u2014 which is being released at midnight on Saturday (just in time for Harry\u2019s birthday Sunday) \u2014 is on track to be a blockbuster. Scholastic, Ms. Rowling\u2019s American publisher, is printing 4.5 million copies \u2014 a staggeringly large number, though it scarcely approaches the 12-million-copy run for \u201cDeathly Hallows.\u201dBarnes & Noble reported that \u201cCursed Child\u201d is the most heavily preordered book since \u201cDeathly Hallows.\u201d On Amazon, \u201cCursed Child\u201d has held steady at, or near, the top of the best-seller list since publication was announced in February, making it the site\u2019s best-selling book so far this year.Some booksellers and librarians say that the story\u2019s format could introduce young readers to the pleasures of reading drama for entertainment. While most high school students are exposed to classics by Shakespeare, Sophocles and Arthur Miller, children and teenagers rarely pick up plays for fun.Scholastic is hoping that readers will embrace the book, regardless of the form. \u201cPlay format, novel format, it\u2019s still a story,\u201d said Arthur A. Levine, the vice president and publisher of Arthur A. Levine Books, a Scholastic imprint that publishes Harry Potter.As the series, which has sold more than 450 million copies globally, has become an undisputed modern classic, Scholastic has capitalized by releasing new editions with revamped covers and illustrations.\u201cThey sell year after year after year, when a new generation discovers Harry Potter,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cWe try to keep giving them something new.\u201dUnlike \u201cCursed Child,\u201d this script was written by Ms. Rowling herself.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the release of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.\u201d The script of the play, in book form, will be released at midnight on Saturday, not midnight on Sunday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beetles Do Beatles: Music Coup for an Animated Netflix Show", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byIf Josh Wakely was feeling a little fried, it was understandable: He had quickly become one of the busiest young writers and producers in television \u2014 with a little help from the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Motown.Jet-lagged from repeated trips between New York, Los Angeles and his native Australia, Mr. Wakely, 35, sported a dark stubble and had an errant shirt button undone one afternoon last week at his publicist\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan. But he excitedly tripped over his own syllables as he talked about his three new shows, each of which uses classic pop songs as inspiration, raw material and organizing theme.\u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d an animated children\u2019s series on Netflix based on Beatles songs, begins its first season on Aug. 3. The show features performances of songs like \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d and \u201cHelp!\u201d by Eddie Vedder, Pink and Regina Spektor.Also on the way, with air dates yet to be set, are two other shows Mr. Wakely created: \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d a dark drama for Amazon with characters based on songs by Mr. Dylan; and another animated show for Netflix, still untitled, that makes use of the Motown catalog. Smokey Robinson is its executive music producer.As Mr. Wakely described it, his template began with \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d which he conceived of as a way to extend the current \u201cgolden age of television\u201d into children\u2019s programming. He created the show and also has directing, writing and producing credits.\u201cI realized that these extraordinary melodies would make sense for children, but also the full level of imagination and visual imagery that the Beatles had in their songs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it to go into a strawberry field forever? What would it be like to actually be inside that yellow submarine?\u201dMr. Wakely said he chose the music catalogs partly for their storytelling potential, but beyond \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d he provided scant details. \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d he said, would feature characters from Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs \u201ccolliding\u201d in 1960s America. The Motown show follows an 8-year-old African-American boy named Ben who discovers magical powers that let him bring graffiti to life.\u201cBanksy for children as done by Pixar,\u201d Mr. Wakely said of the Motown show. \u201cThat was my pitch.\u201dIf you had access to the songs of some of the best-known musicians, what kind of TV show would you create? Tell us in 100 words or less.\u201cI had no idea how complicated or how ambitious an idea it was,\u201d Mr. Wakely said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was so na\u00efve, because I wouldn\u2019t have pursued it otherwise.\u201dAmong his earlier work was \u201cMy Mind\u2019s Own Melody,\u201d a short musical film in 2012 in which he worked with Daniel Johns of the Australian rock band Silverchair. Yet Mr. Wakely remained well below the radar of the Hollywood press until making the Beatles deal two years ago for \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d which features five childlike insects living in the tall grass of an overgrown backyard who learn a valuable life lesson \u2014 and a catchy Beatles tune \u2014 in each 11-minute episode.Like the most enduring animation series, the writing in \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d is crafted to appeal to children as well as to their parents, with plenty of allusions to lyrics. In the \u201cHelp!\u201d episode, Jay, a headstrong beetle, gets trapped in a glass jar and needs his friends to come to his rescue.\u201cI thought you never needed anybody\u2019s help in any way,\u201d says Kumi, a ladybug.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jay replies, \u201cbut those days are gone, and now I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201dFor Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which represents both the Beatles and Motown songwriting catalogs, the shows are a way to reach a generation of very young potential listeners. Still, Sony/ATV was typically cautious in approving the deal for \u201cBeat Bugs.\u201d\u201cAs a company, we say no more than we say yes,\u201d said Damian Trotter, managing director of Sony/ATV in Australia, who said he has known Mr. Wakely since the beginning of his career and encouraged him to develop ideas for projects using music. After an initial meeting, Mr. Wakely began to sketch out \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d in detail, and Mr. Trotter said the result impressed Sony/ATV enough to give the green light.\u201cHe demonstrated the power of a great idea,\u201d Mr. Trotter said. (Sony/ATV also controls the Motown catalog, and administers Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs in Australia; the Beatles themselves were not involved in the \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d deal.)Mr. Wakely, who splits his time between Los Angeles and Sydney, said at the time the Beatles deal was finally signed in January 2014, his funds were nearly exhausted. He could afford just six weeks of rent in Los Angeles and was prepared to return to Australia. \u201cI would say to my wife, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be the guy that nearly got the Beatles rights,\u2019\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Netflix announced that \u201cBeat Bugs\u201d had been confirmed for a second season, to begin Nov. 18, with Beatles songs to be sung by Jennifer Hudson, Rod Stewart and Tori Kelly, among others. Mr. Wakely has his hands full, but he said he was already thinking of more music-focused shows.\u201cIt feels like beautifully uncharted territory,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peru Scrambles to Drive Out Illegal Gold Mining and Save Precious Land", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "A force of marines and rangers is outnumbered as it tries to protect the area anchored by the Tambopata reserve, one of the most biologically diverse places on earth.Supported byON THE BORDER OF THE TAMBOPATA RESERVE, Peru \u2014 The raid began at dawn. In four small wooden boats, the forest rangers and Peruvian marines, checking and rechecking their automatic weapons, headed silently downriver toward the illegal gold miners.They didn\u2019t have to go far. Around the first bend was a ramshackle mining settlement, tarps stretched over tree poles. Soon, the marines were firing into the air, the miners and their families were on the run, and the rangers were moving in with machetes.But some experts wonder whether it is far too little too late.With the price of gold high for years, illegal mining has blossomed in many parts of Latin America, not just in Peru. But in this country, one of the world\u2019s major gold producers, the problem has gotten particularly bad.The amount of gold collected by unlicensed miners is far larger than elsewhere in Latin America. And it is ballooning so quickly that environmentalists fear that even a remote reserve like this one \u2014 home to thousands of species of plants and animals, some perhaps not even identified by humans \u2014 has little chance of survival.For all the environmental damage done by corporate mining, illegal miners are far more destructive, experts say. While mining companies tend to concentrate on areas with rich underground veins of gold, illegal miners move swiftly across vast amounts of territory. They cut down broad swaths of jungle, sifting through perhaps 200 tons of topsoil to find enough flecks of gold for a single wedding ring.Without help, some experts say, the areas they leave behind \u2014 robbed of all topsoil and loaded with mercury \u2014 could take 500 years to recover.The miners use so much mercury to process the gold that the government declared a health emergency in much of the Madre de Dios region in May. Tests in 97 villages found that more than 40 percent of the people had absorbed dangerous levels of the heavy metal. Mercury poisoning affects people in many ways, from chronic headaches to kidney damage, but it is most harmful to children, who are likely to suffer permanent brain damage.\u201cThe next generations will pay for what we are doing now,\u201d said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who heads the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment.Statistics undercount the amount of illegal mining. But V\u00edctor Torres Cuzcano, an economist with the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, calculated that unregistered and informal mining increased by 540 percent between 2006 and 2015, while production from legal mining, which brings in tax revenue, fell by 28.5 percent.\u201cI fear that illegal mining is crowding out the legal activities,\u201d said Guillermo Arbe Carbonel, an economist with Scotiabank. \u201cYou see social protests against the legal mining all the time. But the illegal is growing, and it is the worst kind of mining when it comes to the environment.\u201dDeforestation from gold mining accelerated from 5,350 acres per year before 2008 to 15,180 acres each year after the 2008 global financial crisis that rocketed gold prices.Less than a year ago, the Tambopata reserve, a roadless area about the size of Rhode Island, part forest and part savanna, was untouched. Now satellite photographs show telltale patches of wasteland in the reserve, and so much mining that the river on its edge \u2014 the Malinowski, named after a Polish explorer \u2014 has been pushed off its course, made wider and more shallow. In areas where the miners work, the rangers say, the water is so polluted that the fish are all gone.Some advocates say the reserve is all but lost. Early indications suggest that it is rich with gold, especially compared with other parts of this remote state, including the area officially reserved for artisanal mining and the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d bordering the Tambopata reserve.\u201cThey are getting about 12 to 18 grams a day in the official mining corridor,\u201d said Victor Hugo Macedo, who oversees the reserve. \u201cThey are getting 60 to 80 grams in the buffer zone, and they are getting 150 to 200 in the reserve. The miners care more about that than what happens to Tambopata.\u201dThe government has tried varied policies to contain illegal mining, including controls on the amount of fuel coming into the region, Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said. But he conceded that these efforts had had little success. The Peruvian tax authority recently estimated that more than $1 billion worth of gold had been smuggled out of the country just between February and October 2014.Mr. Pulgar-Vidal hopes that the constant presence of armed marines and a stream of raids will persuade the miners to leave the reserve alone.Critics are skeptical. Some suggest that the government may not really be interested in stopping illegal miners. Some Peruvian politicians openly argue that the miners, many of them from indigenous communities, should be allowed to earn a living, a popular stance in a country where half the population is under the poverty level.Up close, the raids look doomed to failure. The marines and rangers are outmanned and underequipped. Even getting to their outposts is a challenge. The best routes are controlled by the miners and considered too dangerous, even for armed soldiers. So on a rainy day, we walked down a narrow path from daybreak through afternoon, but the soldiers had no radios to call for help when it quickly became flooded for vast stretches.In rushing water full of debris, we all took baby steps looking for solid footing as the rain forest suddenly turned into a turbid lake. Weighed down by backpacks filled with water, the soldiers carried their weapons over their heads and tried to keep from going under, not always successfully.The prosecutor who accompanies them on raids had gone ahead on the back of a dirt bike. But that was a luxury. The rangers have only four motorcycles \u2014 for about 100 men stationed at the two outposts along the river.Yet there are at least 5,000 illegal miners in the area, and perhaps as many as 10,000. After a few raids, the marines were out of dynamite and resorted to a less sophisticated tactic: using mallets to smash the truck engines that miners use to power their derricks.The boats used in the raids aren\u2019t any faster than the ones the miners have, and they stalled often. While there has been no violence so far, a sense of menace was in the air. At times, the miners stood on the river\u2019s edge, arms folded, as the marines and rangers sailed by.Carlos Moscoso Garces, a marine, said it was a matter of time before trouble broke out. The miners shrugged off the occasional raid, but what happens once the cost of replacing destroyed mining equipment begins mounting?\u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cwho knows what they will do.\u201dAt one small encampment, a woman implored the soldiers not to destroy her home. She told the men she was just a single mother trying to make a living, so they put some food aside for her before setting everything else on fire.Downriver, as soldiers made a bonfire of several motorcycles they had found, one young man tried to grab his. Forced to his knees, he told the soldiers he was only visiting friends, a story that no one believed. But there was no thought of arresting him, or anyone else. Miles from the nearest paved road and with no facilities for holding prisoners, the logistics made that impossible. Like everyone else encountered, he had no identification and was released without so much as a summons.The marines are realistic. When they passed a giant tent city, with satellite dishes poking up and poles for many more dwellings under construction, they sailed on in search of a more manageable target.By day\u2019s end, the raiders had destroyed two dozen encampments and 15 mining derricks, and invaded mining camps far better equipped than their own. Along the way, the soldiers helped themselves, taking home a freezer, a satellite dish, a VCR, a television set, a soccer ball, a black-and-white puppy and a young pig for dinner.At night, you could hear the sounds of the mining derricks starting up again.An article on July 26 about Peru\u2019s efforts to protect the rain forest from illegal gold mining misstated part of the name of a park where forest rangers and marines conducted a raid in April. It is the Tambopata National Reserve (not \u201cNature\u201d).Andrea Zarate contributed reporting from Lima, Peru.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 For more than a decade, Silicon Valley\u2019s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie.Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a \u201cLike\u201d button.The shift was evident in a Lowe\u2019s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries.The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.Silicon Valley\u2019s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing self-driving cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a half-dozen types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized.\u201cWe saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom \u2014 there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,\u201d said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco.Funding in A.I. start-ups has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1.2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year.\u201cWhenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,\u201d said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. \u201cBut you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don\u2019t happen every day.\u201dSilicon Valley\u2019s new A.I. era underscores the region\u2019s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend.\u201cThis is at the heart of the region\u2019s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. \u201cThe valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning.\u201dThe change spurred a rush for talent in A.I. that has become intense.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. \u201cThe number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy.\u201dThe valley\u2019s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region\u2019s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a consumer-electronics manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the mid-1970s. A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet.A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would \u2014 for at least another generation \u2014 remain the world\u2019s innovation center.How far the A.I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today\u2019s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have human-level intelligence.Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A.I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of start-ups. Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the \u201cA.I. Winter.\u201dThe current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong.\u201cThere is no chance of a new winter,\u201d said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence start-ups.John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A.I. companies. \u201cYou get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,\u201d he said.For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A.I. companies in the 1980s \u2014 Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down \u2014 the Valley\u2019s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered.\u201cSometimes when I hang around with A.I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But as a wealthy financier suddenly thrust onto one of the world\u2019s biggest stages, he is quickly confronting the scrutiny that accompanies the modern political power couple.The news had barely broken that Ms. May was taking office when headlines questioning a possible conflict of interest blared in the news media.For now, the optics of the criticism appear to outweigh the substance.Mr. May, a sunny man with a penchant for tailored pinstripe suits and brogues, does not run a rabble-rousing hedge fund that takes major stakes in companies and aggressively demands change from management. His employer is not a big bank that was bailed out by the government. He is not a high-flying, fast-moving trader.The new first man of Britain works at a low-key American investment firm as a client-relationship manager. He no longer invests money, but acts as a go-between with the firm\u2019s clients.Conjugal scrutiny is certainly to be expected, especially when there is the appearance of possible conflict.So far, the handful of dirt thrown at Mr. May has not stuck. The most damning comment to emerge in British news media from colleagues about Mr. May is that he is a fairly \u201chead-down\u201d type of guy, a politically quiet man who is happy to take a back seat.If anything, he has invited comparisons to Sir Denis Thatcher, the low-key husband of Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister. Mr. Thatcher played a supporting role to the Iron Lady\u2019s career in the spotlight, and famously stated that a partner should \u201calways be present, never there.\u201d Mrs. Thatcher said that being prime minister had been a lonely job, but \u201cwith Denis there, I was never alone.\u201dMr. May has stuck with his wife through rough times, including the loss of her parents soon after they were married. Ever since the pair met at Oxford, at a Conservative Party disco, he has quietly supported her as they both rose early in careers in the financial world.He was by her side as Ms. May pivoted into British politics 13 years ago, first getting elected to Parliament and eventually serving for six years in the difficult cabinet post of home secretary, overseeing the nation\u2019s domestic security and immigration agencies. She has described him as her \u201crock.\u201dMr. May earned a reputation as an astute stock picker in the late 1990s when he ran pension funds for Prudential Portfolio Managers. He eventually moved to Capital Group in 2005, where he veered away from the money managing business and put his skills as a people person to use managing client relationships.As the new first gentleman, Mr. May will be scrutinized as never before, whether for his financial ventures or his sartorial choices. He can only hope the type of coverage likely to emerge in the British news media will be more along the lines of a headline that recently appeared Wednesday in the newspaper Metro right after Ms. May took office.\u201cTheresa May\u2019s husband steals the show in sexy navy suit as he starts new life as First Man,\u201d the headline read.\u201cOh,\u201d the article continued. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget those shoes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo and the Online Universe According to Verizon", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStill, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is.It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations \u2014 advertisers \u2014 that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so.\u201cTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIt\u2019s to appeal to advertisers in a different way.\u201dAlready, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality.But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizon\u2019s existing assets \u2014 phone and data networks that knit together the nation \u2014 might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website \u201cfor the modern bride.\u201dLocation information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well \u2014 all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizon\u2019s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley.And Verizon is eager to change the narrative.Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizon\u2019s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce.Everything about the old-school street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become.Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160,000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans.That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike.This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits.That\u2019s why Lowell McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s empire retention,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and Pok\u00e9mon.It\u2019s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizon\u2019s main moneymaking activity \u2014 selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers.\u201cThere\u2019s not really any synergy between Verizon\u2019s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals.Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues.A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5.5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year.But other new ventures haven\u2019t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizon\u2019s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing.Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isn\u2019t clear. Though the companies aren\u2019t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldn\u2019t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the company\u2019s annual sales.\u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new,\u201d said Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. \u201cPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dMr. Armstrong\u2019s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizon\u2019s forays have already landed the company in hot water.The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew.\u201cThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,\u201d said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it.\u201dGiving advertisers access to smartphone users\u2019 data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesn\u2019t take many complaints to get hauled before the F.C.C.\u201dAnd in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a Verizon-owned site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. \u201cThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,\u201d Mr. Gillula said.Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a well-trafficked home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it co-owns Complex, a men\u2019s lifestyle website.Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted location-based advertising informed by the movements of Verizon\u2019s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the so-called internet of things \u2014 where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web \u2014 augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right industry.\u201dAdvertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. \u201cWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,\u201d said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks.\u201cAdvertisers want to make it work,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interest in supporting and propping up a well-run No. 3.\u201dYet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is \u201cwillful optimism,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger.At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1.2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers.And even if Verizon\u2019s push into digital media doesn\u2019t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo.For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,\u201d said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade.How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation.What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isn\u2019t clear.Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street.So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesn\u2019t regularly break out AOL\u2019s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year.Advertisement"}

Help! \u2014 Hopeful and PatientDear Hopeful,\u201cJane\u201d is a kicky telenovela, about a bright young woman who finds herself accidentally inseminated \u2014 it\u2019s funny and thoughtful, and it\u2019s a show that sees the dignity in all of its characters, even the ostensible villains.But don\u2019t write it off as just a delightful soap. There are complex techniques at work here. Jane is an aspiring writer, and the show plays with different formats, weaving together a meta-narrative about the significance of stories in our lives. Even if you think of yourself as someone who prefers more \u201cserious\u201d fare, give \u201cJane\u201d a go.The creator Jill Soloway\u2019s work on \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d has some clear echoes here, particularly in the primacy of the relationships between adult siblings, and while the Pfefferman family members are not exactly admirable \u2014 everyone\u2019s self-absorbed and at least sometimes mean \u2014 there are some upstanding secondary characters.\u201cCriminal Justice\u201d has two stand-alone seasons: The first about a cabdriver charged with murder, and the second about a woman who kills her husband. They\u2019re both gripping, but my god are they bleak.It\u2019s the earnest, issues-oriented Canadian teen soap you\u2019ve always loved \u2014 a bonkers amount of drama for any one school, and yet an incredible amount of empathy, loyalty and ethical decision-making, too. It\u2019s arguably the most politically progressive show on TV, and it has as many ripped-from-the-headlines stories as any \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d This current incarnation is as good as \u201cDegrassi\u201d has been in years, with fewer crummy characters and a better, more patient pace for its bigger stories.The show is aimed at tweens and teens, but this season has the reappearance of some favorite characters from 15 years ago. Ostensibly this is to celebrate the series\u2019 500th episode, but I think it\u2019s a shout-out to those of us who\u2019ve been watching the show for a long, long time.\u2022 On Wednesday, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d will air another \u201cWeekend Update\u201d special on MSNBC, after the convention coverage ends, so probably around midnight.\u2022 Stephen Colbert will be live again this week, and his guests include John Oliver (Wednesday) and Doris Kearns Goodwin (Thursday).Advertisement"}

In reality, there\u2019s nothing new about it. It has just had different names over the years.Traditional tech companies like IBM were offering similar services. And if you want to get technical, people had been able to buy \u201ctimesharing\u201d on old mainframes as far back as the 1960s.An A.S.P. was meant to do what a cloud computing company does today \u2014 connect people over the internet to software that is hosted in a giant data center. Instead of owning all that equipment or hiring all the people to manage it, you would pay the A.S.P. to do it for you.There were limitations. Internet connectivity was still slow for most people. Most software wasn\u2019t designed to easily run over the internet, and the software used to manage those computer networks was still wonky. And running the A.S.P. operations was ghastly expensive.One of the pioneers of this young business was Marc Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder who would later become one of the most influential venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. In between, Mr. Andreessen co-founded a company called LoudCloud with his Netscape colleague (and later venture capital partner) Ben Horowitz.The acquisition hasn\u2019t changed the fortunes of HP, which has had more than its own share of troubles. But the A.S.P. concept lives on in the mainstream of computing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa, What Else Can You Do? Getting More From Amazon Echo", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byTech FixBILL PYSZCZYMUKA was installing an air-conditioner in an upstairs window last spring when it occurred to him that there was a way to control the machine without getting up from the couch downstairs: his Amazon Echo.\u201cThe moment of truth came when I asked, \u2018Alexa, turn on the air-conditioner,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe unit beeped upstairs, with Alexa telling me, \u2018O.K.\u2019 I thought it was more than O.K. It was cool.\u201dMr. Pyszczymuka is part of a prolific community of Echo tinkerers who are using the smart speaker for much more than playing music. Since Amazon released the Echo last year, it has quickly become the top-selling home audio speaker on Amazon.com and one of the company\u2019s most successful hardware products. While Amazon, which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, has not revealed how many Echos it has sold, people have put the speaker to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool.So I recently revisited the Echo to unearth some of the best tips to getting the most from Alexa. Here\u2019s a rundown.To change the default music player, open the Alexa smartphone app. Then tap Settings, tap Music and Media, and tap Choose Default Music Services and select Spotify for your default music library or Pandora for your default station service. That way, you no longer have to say \u201cPlay Radiohead on Spotify\u201d or \u201cPlay Radiohead on station Pandora\u201d \u2014 you can just say \u201cPlay Radiohead\u201d or \u201cPlay Radiohead station\u201d and the Echo will play music from your service of choice. (Apple Music and Google Play are not supported by the Echo.)Other audio tricks include the ability to ask Alexa to play specific podcasts \u2014 try speaking a command like \u201cAlexa, Play \u2018Fresh Air\u2019\u201d (the NPR show) or \u201cAlexa, Play \u2018This American Life\u2019\u201d (also from NPR). An often-forgotten feature of the Echo is its ability to play live radio stations from all over the world. Just ask Alexa to play the call letters of your favorite radio station like KQED, and the Echo will stream it.Echo tinkerers have been putting the speaker to work in their kitchens. One reason: you can summon Alexa without touching the device, which makes it extremely helpful while preparing food or putting dishes away.Try these basics to get acquainted with Alexa in the kitchen: After you stick a pie or roast in the oven, ask Alexa to set a timer. Need help tripling a recipe? Ask Alexa to do the math (\u201cAlexa, what is three times 127?\u201d). Need to know how many tablespoons are in a cup? Ask Alexa to make the conversion for you.Alexa can also help restock your kitchen. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and are running out of something like Ziploc bags, just say \u201cAlexa, order Ziploc bags\u201d to place an Amazon order right away. If you prefer to pick up the item at a store, say, \u201cAlexa, add Ziploc bags to my shopping list\u201d to affix items to a shopping list in the Alexa smartphone app. The best part about using Alexa to compile a shopping list is that multiple family members can add to it, even after you have left the house.Now that you\u2019re well acclimated to Alexa, consider some advanced hacks, such as configuring the Echo to control different parts of your home, including the thermostat and the light bulbs. This will require buying more gear.Setting up the Smart Plug takes a few minutes. I plugged a bedroom lamp into the Smart Plug, then downloaded the free smartphone app Kasa, which detected the Smart Plug and connected it to my Wi-Fi network.Then I opened the Alexa smartphone app, added the Kasa \u201cskill\u201d (third-party apps for Alexa are called skills) and connected Alexa with my Smart Plug. I subsequently gave the lamp a friendly name: bedroom lamp. Now at night, I can say \u201cAlexa, turn on the bedroom lamp\u201d to light up the bedroom before I walk down the hall.Another nifty use of Alexa is how it can control a smart thermostat, which I tested with my Wi-Fi-controlled Honeywell thermostat. In the Alexa app, I added the Honeywell skill, then scanned for the thermostat and labeled it Honeywell. Saying \u201cEcho, set Honeywell to 80 degrees\u201d set the heater to that temperature. (Alexa also works with other smart thermostats like Nest and the Ecobee 3.)Larger projects like these are expensive and take more technical skill, so I recommend starting with basics like smart lights, plugs and thermostats. Then you can assess whether you need a much smarter home.Looking for more things to do with Echo? Open the Alexa app and add these three skills \u2014 TV Shows, The Bartender and Uber.Then next time you\u2019re couch-surfing, ask Alexa a question like \u201cAsk TV Shows what time \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 airs\u201d to find out what time the show is on. (The answer: Sunday at 11 p.m. eastern on HBO.)Or when trying a new cocktail recipe, say to Alexa, \u201cAsk the bartender how to make a Manhattan\u201d to get a list of ingredients and instructions. And while you are tying your shoes and getting ready to go out, say, \u201cAlexa, ask Uber to request an UberX\u201d to summon a car to your home.The downside of forming a bond with Echo and Alexa? You will wish it can help you with everything, everywhere \u2014 including filing an expense report on the go or turning down the volume of a loud co-worker. At least you will always have a friend waiting for you at home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Silences Doubters With Blockbuster Quarter", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It\u2019s good to be Google. Sometimes it\u2019s just plain great.Revenue rose to $21.5 billion, about $750 million more than analysts were predicting and a 21 percent jump from a year earlier.Earnings per share after excluding certain items was $8.42, or 39 cents more than forecasts. Last year, it was $6.99.Celebration ensued. Alphabet\u2019s shares, which drifted sideways during regular trading, immediately rose 4 percent after hours.In some ways, the quarter was the mirror image of the previous quarter, which was good but not as great as analysts hoped. That knocked the stock back and induced some hand-wringing \u2014 never far below the surface with even the best and most successful internet companies \u2014 that Google\u2019s days of dominance in search and advertising might be on the verge of starting to wane.No such worries were on display on Thursday as executives talked to analysts. Google rose to fame and fortune on desktop searches, but the health of the company is now reflected in its presence on people\u2019s phones, not only with advertising but also with its Android operating system.\u201cThe strength of the quarter is about mobile,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of the Google division where most of the company\u2019s revenue and profits are made. \u201cIt\u2019s transformed the way that people consume information, and Google\u2019s products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience.\u201dLast fall, Google revamped its ad formats and delivery, which have been powering the increase in revenue. The number of paid clicks in the second quarter increased 29 percent from last year, the same rate as in the first quarter. Aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from 2015, the same drop as in the first quarter.Mr. Pichai\u2019s lengthy prepared remarks took a long-term perspective, focusing on the importance of machine learning \u2014 software that adjusts to the user\u2019s experience. It will be, he promised, the source of the next great innovations after the switch to mobile runs its course.Revenue for these \u201cother bets\u201d was $185 million, driven largely by Google Fiber; the thermostat company, Nest; and Verily, a life sciences company. Alphabet said it lost $859 million on \u201cother bets\u201d in the second quarter, more than the $660 million loss a year ago.Alphabet does not break down how many employees work at the moonshots, but in general the company\u2019s head count is rising almost as fast as its revenue. More than 66,000 people now work at the company, up nearly 17 percent over the last year.Some analysts predict that Google will sooner or later need innovation closer to home than its moonshots, somewhat in the mode of the ceaselessly inventive Amazon or Apple.\u201cAmazon took their retailing platform and built a multibillion-dollar stream of web services. Apple is increasingly talking about money from services, not just hardware,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cGoogle needs things that expand beyond advertising to give it greater breadth.\u201dGoogle could eventually be forced to pay billion-dollar fines. It would not miss the money but if the cases succeed in distracting the company and tempering its innovations, that could be a real problem for management and ultimately shareholders. On Thursday, no one seemed unduly worried about this possibility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Schamus, a Hollywood Honcho, Takes on Directing", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byMr. Schamus is known in Hollywood for being a high-achieving, highbrow go-getter. (He is also known for routinely sporting a bow tie.) He has written and produced dozens of films, many with his longtime friend and collaborator Ang Lee. He was also probably the only Hollywood honcho to earn a Ph.D. (in English, from the University of California, Berkeley) while both running a production company and holding a professorship at an Ivy League graduate school (Columbia University).Alison Cohen Rosa/Roadside AttractionsBut adapt a Roth novel Mr. Schamus did. And, even though he had never done so for a full-length feature, he decided to direct it, too.\u201cIt\u2019s very humbling and potentially humiliating,\u201d Mr. Schamus, 56, speaking in his loft-style offices in Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district, said. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s a luxury to be able to say: \u2018Yeah, if I\u2019m going to get humiliated, fine. There\u2019s a space in your life when I\u2019m just too old to worry about this.\u2019\u201dAware that his extensive film pedigree would heighten industry scrutiny, Mr. Schamus said he girded himself and his family \u2014 he and his wife, the writer and poet Nancy Kricorian, have two grown daughters \u2014 for excoriating criticism of the film.\u201cI said, \u2018Here\u2019s the deal guys, I\u2019m going to make this movie, and the odds are overwhelmingly against me that it\u2019s going to be any good,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schamus said. \u201cMost people who get struck by this disease of middle age, whether it\u2019s producers wanting to direct or actors wanting to sing, it just doesn\u2019t usually work out.\u201dBut the movie\u2019s premiere this year at the Sundance Film Festival was met with cheering from the audience and largely warm reviews. Critics praised the film\u2019s meticulous composition and nimble evocation of the essence of Mr. Roth\u2019s tale. Mr. Schamus\u2019s industry friends and colleagues were similarly impressed. \u201cThis is a guy who was an executive who greenlighted films, who passed judgment on people his whole career,\u201d said John Sloss, a lawyer and independent film producer. \u201cTo put yourself in the line of fire, that is a very big, gutsy career move.\u201dBecoming a director had never been part of Mr. Schamus\u2019s life plan, and it probably happened only because of his dismissal from Focus. While he now says he could sense his tenure there coming to an end, it must have stung, especially because Focus grew out of Good Machine, the sales and production company he founded in the early \u201990s with Ted Hope, who now heads motion picture production at Amazon Studios.In a statement at the time, Donna Langley, the chairman of Universal Pictures, Focus Features\u2019 parent, said the division would be putting out a greater variety of films and touted Mr. Schamus as \u201ca passionate advocate for specialty film.\u201d Mr. Schamus said he left deeply proud of his work, and also somewhat relieved.\u201cIndignation\u201d was the only project Mr. Schamus took with him. He had optioned the novel years earlier and envisioned it being directed by Mr. Lee, whose collaborations with Mr. Schamus included \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d \u201cThe Ice Storm\u201d and \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\u201dSigourney Weaver and Kevin Kline in Ang Lee\u2019s \u201cThe Ice Storm,\u201d another collaboration with James Schamus.Mr. Lee entertained the idea of directing \u201cIndignation,\u201d but then signed on to do \u201cLife of Pi.\u201d\u201cI had to decide between a trip across the Pacific with a tiger, or to pick up the angry, older Philip Roth,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a phone interview. That Mr. Schamus ended up directing it, Mr. Lee said, was a relief: \u201cIt got me off the hook.\u201dWhat was it about \u201cIndignation\u201d that Mr. Schamus found so compelling? He fell in love with its characters, he said \u2014 \u201cyour heart breaks, that\u2019s all\u201d \u2014 and found the story\u2019s Jewish protagonist intrinsically appealing. Movies about everyday Jewish life, he felt, were sorely lacking\u201cI\u2019ve always been surprised, being Jewish myself, that the one thing you never make a movie about is Jewish experience,\u201d Mr. Schamus said. \u201cI love the fact that these are Jewish characters.\u201dMr. Schamus adapted the script but, he said, Mr. Roth refused to read it. (The author was also not available to comment for this article, according to his literary agency.) \u201cI said to him, \u2018You\u2019re definitely making a healthy choice, but it\u2019s also a gift,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schamus said.The notion of directing crept in stealthily. Mr. Schamus was more or less unemployed, the picture was boutiquey and smart, and, with his youngest daughter at college, he and his wife were empty nesters, giving him time for the all-encompassing demands of directing. He decided to give it a try and resolved, he said, to not ask for favors from any of his \u201cfancy friends and multiple Academy Award-winning whoever\u201d to make the picture. \u201cTo be honest, I think a lot of my friends expected that call, and I had to explain why I wasn\u2019t making it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a favor. I don\u2019t want a cut fee. I want to work in this extremely low budget, polite space.\u201dPreparing to direct, Mr. Schamus reverse engineered the script: For every scene, he and his production team pulled similar scenes from other movies, studying the camera movements, the coverage and the blocking. He put together a shot list that included drawings, location photos, floor plans, stills from other movies and paintings. He had his star, Mr. Lerman, read Plath, Whitman and Bertrand Russell, and the pair spent six months poring over the character. \u201cI\u2019m just constantly learning from him,\u201d Mr. Lerman said.Wanting the film to feel authentically of its period, he used minimal hand-held shots and executed exceedingly long \u2014 at least by today\u2019s standards \u2014 takes. The film was shot over a breakneck 24 days last summer, in Westchester, on Long Island and in Queens, and Mr. Schamus loved every minute.\u201cIt was always a crisis, but we had a great time,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cNow I know how much fun directing is. I didn\u2019t know. No one told me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lost Culture on Found Film", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOn DVDAs our nation\u2019s original \u201cothers,\u201d Native Americans were a screen on which white settlers and their descendants projected their fantasies, if not their sense of guilt \u2014 particularly at the movies. Mainly in westerns, indigenous Americans were alternately nature\u2019s noblemen and creatures of untrammeled id, stand-ins for Chinese communists and the third world\u2019s oppressed masses.\u201cThe Daughter of Dawn,\u201d a 1920 feature only recently recovered from the limbo of lost films and now on disc from Milestone, is one of these; it was made in the Wichita Mountains of southwestern Oklahoma the same year as a small cluster of sympathetic films that included \u201cBefore the White Man Came\u201d; three Prizma Color documentaries (\u201cThe Land of the Great Spirit,\u201d \u201cLife in the Blackfoot Country\u201d and \u201cThe Heritage of the Red Man\u201d); and a public health educational film shot on the Arapaho reservation in Wyoming, \u201cNurse Among the Tepees.\u201dWritten and directed by Norbert Myles, a former vaudeville actor, \u201cThe Daughter of Dawn\u201d was publicly screened once in Los Angeles and a year later in Topeka, Kan., then vanished. Around the turn of the 21st century, a complete nitrate print mysteriously surfaced as a form of payment given to a North Carolina private detective; ascertaining the rarity of the material, he sold the print to the Oklahoma Historical Society, which supervised its restoration.\u201cThe Daughter of Dawn\u201d was shot in black and white, with a frequent use of a golden tint \u2014 perhaps meant to suggest a timeless Golden Age \u2014 that reinforces its status as buried historical treasure. Supposedly based on a Comanche legend, the movie concerns the competition between two Kiowa warriors for the affections of the chief\u2019s daughter, Dawn. In part, their contest involves hurling oneself off a cliff \u2014 an act of heedless bravado reminiscent of the game of chicken in \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d The loser is exiled, precipitating a short war between the Kiowas and Comanches before the requisite happy ending.Plot is secondary to the movie\u2019s documentary aspects. The cast includes two children of the celebrated Comanche chief Quanah Parker, himself the son of Cynthia Ann Parker, the white settler\u2019s child who, kidnapped by Comanches, grew up in and became part of the tribe. (Her story was an inspiration for the novel adapted as the film \u201cThe Searchers.\u201d) In a sense, \u201cThe Daughter of Dawn\u201d is a living diorama. The performers seem more positioned than directed, and the movie\u2019s fascination for a contemporary viewer derives from their self-presentation.Directed by Irvin Kershner, this film begins more or less where \u201cThe Daughter of Dawn\u201d ends \u2014 with one tribe attacking another\u2019s idyllic village. It is, however, far more violent and far less straightforward. Where \u201cThe Daughter of Dawn\u201d interprets Native American culture according to the precepts of 19th-century American melodrama, \u201cThe Return\u201d simultaneously embodies the white supremacist attitudes of early 20th-century pulp fiction (\u201cTarzan\u201d springs to mind) and, a particularly graphic buffalo slaughter notwithstanding, the countercultural romanticism of the 1960s.Less a sequel to \u201cA Man Called Horse\u201d than a 70-millimeter remake, again with subtitles to translate much of the Native American dialogue, \u201cThe Return\u201d transports the British aristocrat Lord John Morgan (Richard Harris) back to the Yellow Hand Sioux tribe that captured him in the first movie. Once more (and at greater length), he undergoes the grueling, gruesome skin-piercing initiation rite referred to as the Sun Vow, and, thus repurified, again leads his adoptive people to victory.Reviews were not kind when \u201cThe Return\u201d opened 40 summers ago. While acknowledging the film\u2019s visual grandeur (well served by the Blu-ray transfer), Vincent Canby of The New York Times found it \u201cmore unpleasantly patronizing than uplifting,\u201d while, in The New Yorker, Penelope Gilliatt joked, with reference to the Sun Vow, that the movie should be called \u201cThe Return of Tell Me When I Can Look.\u201d It may have been Ms. Gilliatt\u2019s negative comments that prompted her colleague Pauline Kael to re-review the movie when she had the opportunity.Ms. Kael praised \u201cThe Return\u201d as \u201cthe first Hollywood epic in which the rituals of the Indians make sense.\u201d She also saw it as reviving the optimistic attitude that she believed characterized the western genre and was presumably dampened by the tumult of the 1960s. In \u201cThe Return,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthe surge of elation comes from the spiritual rebirth of an Indian tribe.\u201d In a way, the movie was a hippie fairy tale.George Lucas appears to have been another fan. It was on the basis of \u201cThe Return\u201d that he enlisted Mr. Kershner (his instructor and mentor at the University of Southern California) to direct the second, more mystical and darker installment of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d \u2014 or at least that\u2019s the legend.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

Or maybe they sympathize with Conrad, who was undoubtedly under pressure from the board to have his company live up to the incredible hype. Who knows?Now Spotify has written a legal letter to Apple decrying the \u201cgrave harm to Spotify and its customers,\u201d and it cleverly sent out copies of the letter to lawmakers in Washington \u2014 a suggestion that Apple might get in trouble with lawmakers over its rejection. Given that Apple has its own music streaming service that directly competes with Spotify, its tactics could raise antitrust issues.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla. The car was supposed to stop, but it didn\u2019t. The traffic safety administration is now investigating the crash.What do you think of this case? Does it give you pause about self-driving cars?That\u2019s probably to be expected, because it\u2019s a new type of behavior that we\u2019re not used to. Time and conditioning normalizes things, like not steering my car when I\u2019m driving it. All of tech, and really much of the automotive industry, speaks of driverless cars with the gravitas of inevitability: In the future, driving yourself will be more foreign than you think.That\u2019s why something like this isn\u2019t just bad for Tesla, it\u2019s bad for everyone betting on this future. Go listen to the leaders at Lyft, Uber or General Motors talk about driverless. Things like this inhibit this vision.Anyway, how does the industry recover from this? Just keep marching toward inevitability?So I bet that\u2019s how we\u2019ll deal with these self-driving cars, too. They\u2019re still gonna kill us, but they\u2019ll kill us less often than the killing machines we use now, We\u2019ll mostly forget about all the death, and we\u2019ll live happily ever after.Anyway, happy 4th!Advertisement"}

Bigelow, Ronald Freyberger stood at the rear counter and updated a manager, Joseph Campanile, about the splint on his right hand. \u201cThe doctors still aren\u2019t sure what the issue is, but either way, I still need to keep wearing this thing,\u201d he said. Mr. Campanile asked about Mr. Freyberger\u2019s health and how he was feeling that day. ( \u201cAll things considered,\u201d he said, \u201cpretty good.\u201d)While waiting for his prescription to be filled, Mr. Freyberger, 74, sat at one of two wooden chairs at the side of the counter and began bantering with the women working at the store\u2019s expansive beauty island. He said hello to Samantha Watson, who is in her early 30s, and complimented the elegant appearance of Colleen Blanchette, who is in her 60s and has worked at the pharmacy for more than a decade.\u201cYou\u2019re too nice, Ronald,\u201d Ms. Blanchette replied with a smile.\u201cComing here is like coming home,\u201d Mr. Freyberger said. As testament to his devotion to C.O. Bigelow, consider that Mr. Freyberger lives in Kingsbridge Heights in the Bronx, about 14 miles away, and has still visited the pharmacy once a week for the last quarter-century.The store was opened in 1838 by Dr. Galen Hunter as the Village Apothecary Shop at 102 Sixth Avenue, and he eventually sold it to an employee, Clarence Otis Bigelow, in 1880. Mr. Bigelow moved it two doors north, to the current location in 1902, where the original brass finishes, including the gas chandeliers, are still intact.William Ginsburg took ownership in 1939 and today, his grandson Ian Ginsburg, 53, runs the day-to-day operations. He beams with pride when talking about his store\u2019s history. If you count the original store (and Mr. Ginsburg certainly does), C.O. Bigelow claims it is the oldest pharmacy in the United States.It has had a devoted following for much of its existence, and was said to be favored by Mark Twain, Thomas Edison and Eleanor Roosevelt. Today, with an inventory of nearly 500 beauty brands, both mainstream and boutique, it is a destination for beauty-product junkies.Fitch Ball, 26, an artist and waitress who lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn, was in the store that Monday looking at makeup. \u201cI\u2019m here twice a week, browsing,\u201d she said. Her last purchase at the store, from the brand Bumble and bumble, was a hair wax to keep her blond strands smooth and still.Nearby, Ms. Watson was telling another young woman about the merits of dry shampoo. They talked for more than a half-hour, but the women left empty-handed, saying that she would return after giving the purchase more thought.By now, Mr. Freyberger had left and Ken Barnett, 43, was sitting in his place, eating an edamame salad. Mr. Barnett, a regular on the Amazon series \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d happened to be picking up a prescription that day but said he has been coming to C.O. Bigelow since he moved to the neighborhood 16 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s my spot,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an actor, I have to wear a lot of makeup for roles, which makes me break out, and when that happens, I\u2019m here finding a cure.\u201dIt was close to 6 p.m., and the steady stream of customers wasn\u2019t abating. This pace would continue until 9, when the store closes on weekdays. The next morning, the rhythm, as it has for more than 175 years, would begin all over again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Is Poised to Be Britain\u2019s Next Prime Minister", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Theresa May emerged on Monday as Britain\u2019s next prime minister, becoming the second woman, after Margaret Thatcher, to hold that post. She faces multiple challenges as soon as she takes office, from negotiating the nation\u2019s departure from the European Union to addressing deep social and political divisions to reviving a wounded economy.Her victory came on another day of rapid developments in British politics and set in motion a process that officials said would put her in 10 Downing Street by Wednesday night, succeeding David Cameron.A Conservative like Mrs. Thatcher, who governed from 1979 to 1990, Ms. May, 59, has won a reputation for steeliness in her tenure as home secretary. She has pledged to negotiate a deal to leave the European Union that would reassert Britain\u2019s ability to control immigration, a central issue in the referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the bloc.Yet unlike Mrs. Thatcher, Ms. May is seen as a relative moderate and on Monday she promised to address inequality, give workers greater representation on corporate boards and limit tax cuts.Ms. May said that she was \u201chonored and humbled\u201d to be chosen for the job, promised to get the best deal over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and vowed to create an economy that works not for the \u201cprivileged few,\u201d but for all.The British referendum on June 23 plunged the European Union into crisis. It left Britain rudderless as the pound sank in value and both the governing and opposition parties engaged in fierce and acrimonious leadership battles. Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday.Mr. Cameron\u2019s statement completed a day of high political drama in which Ms. May\u2019s rival for the Conservative Party leadership, Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, withdrew from the race. Leading party members quickly coalesced around Ms. May, insisting that the contest should not be reopened. A party committee agreed.Ms. Leadsom had already faced accusations \u2014 which she denied \u2014 of embellishing her curriculum vitae, but her campaign ran aground over the weekend after The Times of London published an interview in which she suggested that she was a better candidate because she is a mother, while Ms. May is not.Surrounded by supportive lawmakers, Ms. Leadsom on Monday made no reference to that issue, but said that she was quitting the contest and endorsing Ms. May, and that she hoped to see her installed as prime minister \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dThe turn of events meant that Ms. May would become prime minister without a general election and without completing the campaign she and Ms. Leadsom had been waging for the endorsement of the Conservative Party\u2019s rank-and-file members.Last week, the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke described Ms. May as a \u201cbloody difficult woman,\u201d noting that he had worked for another female politician of similar temperament, namely Mrs. Thatcher.Far from being insulted, Ms. May used the comment to suggest that her negotiating stance with European officials would be as tough as that of Mrs. Thatcher, who went into battle on the Continent, particularly over British financial contributions to the bloc.\u201cKen Clarke might have found me to be a \u2018bloody difficult woman.\u2019 The next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker,\u201d she told fellow Conservative lawmakers, referring to the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive, ITV reported.But in a speech on Monday, Ms. May outlined an economic agenda unlike that of Mrs. Thatcher, calling for new mechanisms to curb executive pay and warning big multinational companies that they must pay their share of taxes.Ms. May has also been compared to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany who, like Ms. May, is the daughter of a clergyman and is known for her no-nonsense, methodical and pragmatic approach.The post-referendum turmoil in Britain has also gripped the opposition Labour Party, prompting a challenge against its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of not campaigning hard enough against a British withdrawal from Europe. There were growing fears on Monday that the party might split because of the bitter dispute.Nevertheless, opposition politicians called for a general election and questioned Ms. May\u2019s democratic mandate, since she will assume the job on the basis of an internal transfer of power within the governing party. So far, Ms. May has rejected the notion of a quick general election.Her top priority will be to frame a negotiating strategy for leaving the union, after the referendum in which she sided with those who wanted to remain.On Monday, Ms. May insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d as she sought to reassure right-wingers that she was committed to the policy, adding that \u201cthere will be no attempt to remain inside the E.U. There will be no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, no second referendum.\u201dBut, while 52 percent of voters supported Brexit, they did so for differing reasons, including reasserting national sovereignty and opposition to migration from within the bloc, which guarantees the right to live and work within any member nation.Ms. May is expected to take a tough stance on immigration in part because she is politically vulnerable on the issue. As home secretary, she failed to fulfill a Conservative pledge to control the number of people arriving in Britain. The numbers persistently exceeded targets and included arrivals of non-Europeans, which the government had the power to curb.Ms. May has signaled her intention to restrict migration from Europe, even if doing so hurt Britain\u2019s position in negotiating a new trade deal with the bloc. She will also be under pressure from big business to secure the best possible access to Europe\u2019s single market, which normally entails accepting the principle of free movement of workers across national frontiers.One important question for Ms. May is when to invoke Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s governing treaty, which starts the withdrawal procedure. That effectively sets a two-year deadline for a deal to be struck. She has suggested that she intends to wait until her government has settled on its negotiating stance before invoking the article despite pressure from Europe\u2019s leaders to act more quickly.On Monday she said more about her wider political agenda in a speech that offered plans to address some of the economic and social inequalities evident in Britain. Those include populist resentments thought to have motivated many pro-Brexit voters in economically depressed areas outside London and in the affluent southeast of England.\u201cThere is a growing divide between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. And there is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,\u201d she said, positioning herself in a centrist tradition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism.Speaking in Birmingham, England, Ms. May also called for efforts to increase productivity, for employees and consumers to gain seats on company boards and for votes on executive pay to become binding rather than advisory. Big multinationals should pay their share of taxes, she said, adding: \u201cWhether you\u2019re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on July 12 about the emergence of Theresa May as Britain\u2019s new prime minister referred incorrectly in some editions to her place in British history. She is the second woman to serve as Britain\u2019s prime minister, not the \u201csecond woman after Margaret Thatcher\u201d to do so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$1 Billion for Dollar Shave Club: Why Every Company Should Worry", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe deal anecdotally shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change. The very nature of a company is fundamentally changing, becoming smaller and leaner with far fewer employees.Dollar Shave Club was a phenom in the men\u2019s grooming industry. The online business was founded in 2011 by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin to combat the high cost of razors. The idea was rather simple. Instead of paying $10 or $20 a month at a store for disposable razors, a Dollar Shave Club subscriber could go online and set up a regular order to be shipped to his home monthly at a fraction of the retail cost.From there, the start-up investor community came in and Dollar Shave Club soared, raising $160 million in venture capital. It captured about 8 percent of the market in only a few years. It also expanded into other personal care products like \u201cOne Wipe Charlie,\u201d a wet wipe to replace toilet paper.The company\u2019s rise was captured by the Unilever purchase announced last week.The wealth will be spread among a few. Dollar Shave Club has over three million subscribers but only about 190 employees. Its razors were made in South Korea by Dorco. Distribution was initially handled in-house but eventually was contracted to a third-party company in Kentucky. What remained was a terrific design, marketing and customer service shop; and a business that was easily expandable to meet demand and that had a good niche with men who do not like to shop. These super-successful companies with few employees should worry an America struggling with inequality.Now it is possible to leverage technology and transportation systems that never existed before. Dollar Shave Club used Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing service started by the online retailing giant in 2006 that encouraged a proliferation of e-commerce companies. Manufacturing now is just as much a line item as is a distribution apparatus. This is the business strategy of many other disruptive companies, including the home-sharing site Airbnb, which upends the idea of needing a hotel. The ride-hailing start-up Uber could never have been possible without a number of inventions including the internet, the smartphone and, most important, location tracking technology, enabling anyone to be a driver.It means that the riches will be split among the select few who have the education and skills to be at the heart of the new decentralized company. The Korean razor company that manufactures Dollar Shave\u2019s razors will not be sharing the $1 billion deal price with its employees. It was not even an investor (the investors here will also profit, with returns of up to 20 times their investments).This is a scary time for a company. But the state of play creates the potential for mass and creative disruption. Again, in the past, challenging Gillette would have been impossible. It would have required billions of dollars to invest in a distribution network and advertising to get the product on store shelves.No more. Now you can get free advertising through YouTube, easy distribution through the mail system and low-cost sales through the internet. Factories and distribution can be bolted on throughout the globe.This means all companies should be fearful, but not all is lost. In this world, intellectual property and unique assets \u2014 like Facebook\u2019s more than one billion users \u2014 become paramount. Unique technology means you have a right that cannot be taken away or commoditized. Gillette sued Dollar Shave Club for patent infringement, but it is hard to patent a simple razor.Dollar Shave Club may be an uncommon event. But it is no doubt the wave of the future. Expect more start-ups in disruptive areas. Expect more old-line companies to find themselves on their back feet, compensating by paying outsize, sometimes incredulous sums for breakthrough competitors. And expect more enormous investment in all things new as the old companies without unique assets struggle to compete.An article on the DealBook page on Wednesday about the high prices old-line consumer products companies are paying for disruptive start-ups misspelled the name of a technology website that reported on market share gains by small brands. It is TechCrunch, not TechCruch.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

{"Headline": "Governors Island, a Grand Space to Play", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byMister Softee had just sold one last rocket pop when a young woman wobbled onto the deck. Her tote bag read \u201c#ros\u00e9allday,\u201d and her espadrilles said \u201cRos\u00e9\u201d on the vamp of the right shoe and \u201cAll Day\u201d on the left. She precariously clutched an empty jeroboam of wine and a green bottle of \u201cwater.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an ice-cream truck in this boat?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s on the boat!\u201d She was surprised, also, to spot a friend on the top deck. \u201cShut up! Were you at the thing? I haven\u2019t gotten to Instagram yet.\u201dIce cream is essential to the summer vibe of New York\u2019s green spaces, with Central Park the paragon, a landscaped oasis of enchantment and premium vanilla bars. At Brooklyn Bridge Park, you may sup on a scoop of Ample Hills\u2019 Ooey Gooey Butter Cake while watching the helicopters thrum across the cityscape like parents at the adjacent playgrounds.Visitors strolling the High Line this season encounter a sculpture contrasting a photograph of ice cream with a giant fan that, given the decadence of neighboring boutiques, somewhat resembles an industrial guillotine.Four hundred years after its settlement by the Dutch \u2014 after its tenure as a military base ended in 1996, after proposals to turn it into a casino or a prison or a development \u2014 Governors Island has emerged as a grand populist play space.Ms. Koch therefore ranks as a great New Yorker, but she is not really in control of the culture here. Arranging an event on Governors Island scarcely differs from applying for a permit at other parks, and the various delights that roll down the ferries\u2019 lift bridges \u2014 hula hoops and unicycles, Hawaiian ukuleles and bluegrass mandolins, gear for badminton tournaments and pop-up parkour courses \u2014 are not curated.Ms. Koch does have a say over concessions, however, and they include Blue Marble ice cream, which now offers the Governor, a caramel-vanilla swirl laced, in homage to debris, with Grape-Nuts clusters and velvet-cake shreds.Which is all to say that Governors Island is the flavor of the season: a day-trip utopia where fashion photographers jaunt for location shoots, and Cond\u00e9 Nast treats its digital-strategy team to beach-party tomfoolery. Pinknic drew a crowd so sharp as to supply much fresh intelligence on keeping Adidas Stan Smiths from looking stale.Though deed restrictions ensure that the island won\u2019t be overrun by commerce or luxury condos, a day spa is on the way, and the construction cranes scattered across the skyline are reminders that change is a constant. But this is its summer of perfect contentment.Michelle Palmer and Erik Slavin married June 4 on a grassy slope south of Governors Island\u2019s Fort Jay. The bride, a 36-year-old headdress designer, was dressed as Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, and the groom, a 49-year-old digital artist, was got up as Theseus. \u201cWe condensed \u2018A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u2019 down to 20 minutes for the ceremony,\u201d Mr. Slavin said. Puck was maid of honor.\u201cBy definition, junk has no value to adults, so children understand implicitly that they can take ownership of it,\u201d said Alex Khost, a 41-year-old web developer who administrates this free weekend playground and its weekday summer camp.At Play:ground, I initialed a waiver form seven times so that my only son could manipulate trash in a yard that reminded my wife of conditions in rural Guatemala.Governors Island is just the place to explore the decorum of progressive parenting. Here, mothers performatively scold themselves for allowing their children to run around doing whatever, confessions that are actually boasts about having the wisdom to visit a place where the prize for gaining the top of a rope climb is face time with Lady Liberty.These juxtapositions \u2014 Ms. Palmer in her bridal unitard next to children preparing to revel in rubble \u2014 are essential to the local magic. It\u2019s a shame that the goats down at the farm don\u2019t know how darling they look contrasted with 1 World Trade Center. It\u2019s a hoot that a scrappy punk festival tends to coincide with a military history fair. Punk Island was a smash this year, with the headliner, Leftover Crack, supported by bands with names like Sun Rot, Insubordination and Material Support.I watched a group called Lady Bizness unleash a fine Riot grrrl squall about 20 paces from Figment\u2019s whimsical miniature golf course for a crowd wearing black T-shirts ranging from classics (the Cramps) to novelties (\u201cI\u2019m a divisive issue\u201d). When the kids went for a bite to eat, it was like a night on old St. Marks Place, what with the monoxide fog of food-truck exhaust and the chaos of eight bands playing on eight stages swirled into a hypnotic drone.It is easy to quickly grow protective of a place like this, which is at once a depository for New York\u2019s eccentricities and a showcase for its popular tendencies. The dolls and dandies attending the Jazz Age Lawn Party simultaneously express a passion for arcana and a thirst for making the scene as they lunch on the lawn (plucking grapes, scooping quinoa, picking at Caligulan spreads of Carr\u2019s crackers) or else cocktail like tycoons in $5,000 V.I.P. tents.But there are limits. \u201cWe did reduce ticket sales,\u201d Mr. Arenella said. \u201cIn 2012 and 2013, it started to feel too crowded \u2014 blankets upon blankets upon blankets. I want it to always feel that you\u2019re at a picnic.\u201dWhether the entertainment is hot jazz or deep house or punk rock, the headline act is always the symphonic vista from the ferry \u2014 the spires of Midtown and the steeples of Brooklyn chiming, the loading cranes of New Jersey calling to their Brooklyn kin, the towers of the bridges revealed in rhythmic new arrangements as you make the passage to a bite-size empire of ice cream, where the city naps and dreams.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Is Confronting an Epidemic of Anti-Gay Violence", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byIn a nation seemingly inured to crime, the brutal killings stood out: The victims were not robbed, the police have yet to identify any suspects, and all of the dead were either gay or transgender.\u201cAnd these numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg of violence and bloodshed,\u201d said Eduardo Michels, the group\u2019s data manager, adding that the Brazilian police often omit anti-gay animus when compiling homicide reports.Such statistics can be hard to square with Brazil\u2019s storied image as a tolerant, open society \u2014 a nation that seemingly nurtures freewheeling expressions of sexuality during Carnival and holds the world\u2019s biggest gay pride parade in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.Here in Rio de Janeiro, host to the coming Summer Olympics, fear of violent crime is on many people\u2019s minds. Amid a crushing recession and soaring unemployment, street crime is up 24 percent this year and homicides have increased by more than 15 percent.At the same time, human rights activists say members of the Rio police force, eager to clean up the city ahead of the Aug. 5 opening ceremony for the Games, have shot dead more than 100 people this year, most of them young black men living in poor neighborhoods.But advocates say the constant homophobic violence also threatens to upend an idealized national ethos that promises equality and respect for all Brazilians.Brazil\u2019s near-mythic reputation for tolerance is not without justification. In the nearly three decades since democracy replaced military dictatorship, the Brazilian government has introduced numerous laws and policies aimed at improving the lives of sexual minorities. In 1996, it was among the first to offer free antiretroviral drugs to people with H.I.V. In 2003, Brazil became the first country in Latin America to recognize same-sex unions for immigration purposes, and it was among the earliest to allow gay couples to adopt children.Some experts suggest that liberal government policies may have gotten too far ahead of traditional social mores. The anti-gay violence, they contend, can be traced to Brazil\u2019s culture of machismo and a brand of evangelical Christianity, exported from the United States, that is outspoken in its opposition to homosexuality.Evangelicals make up nearly a quarter of Brazil\u2019s population, up from 5 percent in 1970, and religious leaders reach millions of people through the hundreds of television and radio stations they have purchased in recent years.American-style Pentecostal congregations are also playing an increasingly muscular role in Brazilian politics. Evangelical voters have helped send more than 60 lawmakers to the 513-member lower house of Congress, doubling their numbers since 2010 and making them one of the most disciplined blocs in an unruly and divided legislature.Jean Wyllys, Brazil\u2019s only openly gay member of Congress, said evangelical lawmakers, the core of a coalition known as the \u201cB.B.B. caucus\u201d \u2014 short for Bullets, Beef and Bible \u2014 have stymied legislation that would punish anti-gay discrimination and increase penalties for hate crimes.\u201cEvangelicals are getting increasingly powerful and have taken over Congress,\u201d Mr. Wyllys said.Eduardo Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator who served as president of the lower house, once suggested that Congress establish a Heterosexual Pride Day. After a Brazilian soap opera featured a gay kiss, he broadcast his revulsion on Twitter. (Mr. Cunha, who faces allegations that he took $40 million in bribes, was ordered to step down in May.)Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College who studies gay rights movements in Latin America, said much of the homophobia was a reaction to achievements like same-sex marriage.\u201cBrazilians are becoming more tolerant,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the countertrend is that those who remain intolerant and opposed to L.G.B.T. rights are developing new strategies and a more virulent discourse to block progress on those issues.\u201d\u201cThey put civilization and traditional families at risk of destruction,\u201d he said.Conservative politicians have resisted efforts to teach tolerance in schools, and the police have shown little interest in adopting training programs to help rank-and-file officers tackle bias crimes. Victims of anti-gay and transgender violence say they often experience a fresh round of humiliation from the law enforcement authorities, some of whom are openly hostile to requests that they record a crime as bias-motivated.Over several hours, he said, officers at a police station insisted that he had been the victim of a simple robbery because he lost his cellphone and wallet during the chaos. \u201cIn the end, they made me doubt whether a homophobic attack really happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made me doubt if I was in my right mind.\u201dWhen the police arrived, they repeatedly questioned his account and, after he insisted that they record the attack as a hate crime, told him to drape himself over the trunk of their vehicle and assume the pose of a suspect. \u201cThey made me feel like I was a criminal,\u201d he said.\u201cTranssexuals live with constant fear,\u201d Mr. Kvalo said.Even when suspects in homophobic violence are arrested, advocates say, they are often treated leniently. The two men who savagely beat Andr\u00e9 Baliera, a 28-year-old law student, in an upscale neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo were originally charged with attempted murder. Last year, after serving a two-month sentence, the men were ordered to pay a $6,300 fine and released.The fear is palpable for Gilson Borges Reis, 18, a student in Lauro de Freitas, an industrial city in northeast Brazil. Last month, a cousin who had long taunted him for being gay chased him down the street with a kitchen knife, stabbing him in the chest and arms as relatives watched in horror.Mr. Reis survived, and the cousin, an evangelical Christian, was arrested. He has been charged with attempted murder, but was promptly released on bail.The two cousins live on the same street. \u201cHe passes my house and flashes me an awful expression,\u201d Mr. Reis said through tears. \u201cI have no protection. I am afraid.\u201dTania Franco contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

If you didn\u2019t watch the show, there\u2019s nothing here for you, but if you did, then you\u2019ll be happy to hear that this is exactly in keeping with the series: Superb acting from Groff and Murray Bartlett in particular, but some flabby storytelling and some moments that don\u2019t always feel earned.

The first is a botanist searching for a miracle healing plant. Forty years later, the shaman encounters someone else looking for the same rare flower.Advertisement"}
