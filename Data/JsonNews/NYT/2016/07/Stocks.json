{"Headline": "Financial Strain Grows From \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The financial strains from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union are starting to show, as worries ripple through the country\u2019s real estate market.In the most prominent sign of the pressure, three major real estate funds have frozen withdrawals in the last two days, to slow the exodus of nervous investors. By doing so, the funds are trying to prevent a vicious cycle of selling that could force them to dump assets at ultralow prices, deepen losses and prompt more investors to rush for the exit.The turbulence after the so-called Brexit vote has been high, as investors rapidly exchange risky assets for safer havens. Yields on American Treasuries have touched new lows, while the pound is down sharply. Stocks have been shaky, and shares in some British real estate companies have shed more than a third of their value.The three real estate funds \u2014 run by Standard Life, Aviva Investors and M&G Investments \u2014 each pointed to heightened levels of stress in the market prompting investors to sell. A top British regulator on Tuesday highlighted the potential risk to such funds, which invest heavily in assets that are tough to sell quickly.\u201cThe reality is we don\u2019t fully know what the economic impact of the Brexit is going to be,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, a British financial services company. \u201cThe concern is it\u2019s going to be negative.\u201dAuthorities around the world are paying close attention to the economic, financial and political fallout of the vote, and have plans to move quickly to keep the damage from spreading too far and too fast. The reverberations could test whether, since the global financial crisis, officials have put in place the necessary measures to protect the broader system from a shock.The Bank of England, Britain\u2019s central bank, warned on Tuesday that the environment had become \u201cchallenging,\u201d noting that there were \u201ctightening credit conditions\u201d in the commercial real estate market. To help provide support for the economy, the central bank cut the buffer that British banks need to keep on their books, a move that should allow them to lend more to business and consumers.\u201cWhen combined with the already strong balance sheets of U.K. banks, today\u2019s action means that U.K. households and business who want to seize viable opportunities in a postreferendum world can be confident they will be supported by the financial system,\u201d the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said on Tuesday. \u201cFinancial institutions, like the rest of us, desire certainty in order to plan for the future.\u201dFunds that invest in the British property market look particularly vulnerable in the wake of the Brexit vote.Real estate, particularly high-end properties in London, boomed in recent years as interest rates remained at record lows. Investors, in turn, chased yield, creating huge demand for mutual funds that invested heavily in the country\u2019s malls, office towers and residential developments.While they represent a small piece of the mutual fund world, such investments have \u00a325 billion in assets under management. The Aviva, Standard Life and M&G funds account for about one-third of that market, according to Mr. Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown.Even before the vote, the signs of stress were apparent in the real estate market. Ever-rising prices prompted concerns about a property bubble. Construction activity in Britain posted its weakest performance in seven years in June, driven in part by a steep decline in residential construction ahead of the referendum, according to the latest Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which was released on Monday.But the sector has been shaken by new uncertainty since Britain decided to exit the European Union. London\u2019s future as a regional hub for commerce is in doubt. Cities across Europe are looking to lure companies and jobs. An economic slowdown is an increasing possibility.Mutual funds that focus on real estate face a particular problem in the current tumult. Such funds hold assets that are difficult to trade, but investors can ask for their money back at anytime. When investors panic, the redemption requests can quickly exhaust the funds\u2019 cash on hand.Last December, an American mutual fund run by Third Avenue ran into a similar problem, reflecting the portfolio\u2019s significant exposure to the riskiest types of high-yield bonds. Rather than unload assets into a difficult market, the managers opted to bar the door.With withdrawals mounting, the managers at Aviva Investors, M&G Investments and Standard Life decided it was prudent to do the same.A day earlier, Standard Life Investments, the asset management unit of the large British insurance company, also halted redemption requests in its U.K. Real Estate Fund. It said it had seen an increase in requests for redemptions \u201cas a result of uncertainty for the U.K. commercial real estate market following the E.U. referendum result.\u201dSuch funds are already proving a point of concern for the British authorities.The Bank of England\u2019s report on Tuesday noted that \u201cvaluations in some segments of the market, notably the prime London market, had become stretched.\u201d It warned that any fall in commercial property prices could be \u201camplified\u201d by investors and real estate funds.\u201cThese open-ended funds could be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet redemptions,\u201d the report noted.At a news conference after the release of the report, Andrew Bailey, the head of one of Britain\u2019s financial regulators, said that so-called open-ended real estate funds faced a structural problem, in that their assets did not \u201crevalue naturally\u201d in the market.Mr. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was \u201csensible\u201d to suspend all withdrawals, because authorities did not want those who \u201cget to the door quickly to get a better deal than those that don\u2019t.\u201dBut he conceded that the authorities believed there was a mismatch between such tradable funds and their investments in illiquid real estate assets, and needed to look at \u201cthe design of these things,\u201d Mr. Bailey said.Officials from the Financial Conduct Authority were to meet with major asset managers on Tuesday to discuss the impact of the Brexit referendum, a spokeswoman said.The Investment Association, an industry group that represents British fund managers, said that the use of suspensions of redemptions is an important tool that prevents fund managers from being forced to sell too quickly and achieve better results for clients.\u201cSuspension is a mechanism that is laid out under stringent F.C.A. regulations, and when it is employed by one of our members, it shows that the regulations are working as they are supposed to,\u201d the group said.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barclays Profit Down as It Accelerates Plans to Close Some Business", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Barclays, the British bank, said on Friday that its profit had fallen 41 percent as it accelerated its plans to sell or close businesses and assets that it no longer considered crucial to its strategy.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, has said that disposing of those noncore businesses was a key to unlocking the earnings potential of the bank.Since joining the bank in December, Mr. Staley has sped up those moves and has been focusing the bank\u2019s strategy on two divisions: the British consumer bank and the corporate and investment bank.\u201cThe strategy remains the right one, in our view,\u201d Mr. Staley said during a conference call with journalists. \u201cOur strategy is anchored on the belief that you want to be a large diversified financial institution because we\u2019re not going to escape the volatility that you have in economic cycles. That is particularly noteworthy as we came out of the \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote.\u201cMr. Staley said the bank saw \u201cno reason\u201d to adjust its strategy or change the pace of its delivery, in light of the outcome of the June 23 referendum to leave the European Union, a departure known as Brexit.Uncertainty about the economic effect of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the bloc has roiled the financial markets and hit bank stocks particularly hard across Europe.Barclays shares fell almost 22 percent in London between the vote and Thursday\u2019s close. But its shares were up 6 percent, at 155.35 pence, in morning trading in London on Friday.Since the British vote, the Bank of England has strongly signaled that economic pressures could prompt it to cut interest rates as soon as next month.Barclays said that its operating income, which is similar to revenue in the United States, declined 10 percent, to \u00a35.48 billion, in the second quarter, from \u00a36.07 billion in the period last year. Operating expenses were down 14 percent in the quarter, to \u00a33.87 billion.Barclays\u2019 noncore businesses reported a loss of \u00a3887 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of \u00a3324 million a year earlier.During the quarter, Barclays took a one-time loss of \u00a3182 million with the restructuring of a portfolio of loans made to the local authorities in Britain.Barclays also recognized an impairment of \u00a3372 million related to its consumer banking, life-insurance and wealth and investment management operations in France.A sale would complete Barclays\u2019 exit from retail banking in continental Europe. It has sold operations in Italy, Portugal and Spain in the past year.Mr. Staley said on Friday that the bank expected the drag of the noncore business on its expenses to fall significantly in 2017 as it continued to sell and close operations.Mr. Staley added that he expected expenses from its noncore business to be in the range of \u00a3400 million to \u00a3500 million in 2017. By comparison, the estimated expense cost from the noncore division this year is \u00a31.6 billion, he said.\u201cGiven the strong level of interest in the asset, we have increased confidence in our ability to deconsolidate Africa,\u201d Mr. Staley said.In its corporate and investment bank, profit declined 15 percent, to \u00a31.17 billion, in the second quarter, from \u00a31.38 billion in the period last year.The British consumer bank reported a profit of \u00a3141 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of \u00a3174 million in the second quarter of 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bull Market Blues", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe answer, I\u2019d suggest, isn\u2019t entirely positive. In fact, in some ways the stock market\u2019s gains reflect economic weaknesses, not strengths. And understanding how that works may help us make sense of the troubling state our economy is in.The truth, in any case, is that there are three big points of slippage between stock prices and the success of the economy in general. First, stock prices reflect profits, not overall incomes. Second, they also reflect the availability of other investment opportunities \u2014 or the lack thereof. Finally, the relationship between stock prices and real investment that expands the economy\u2019s capacity has gotten very tenuous.On the first point: We measure the economy\u2019s success by the extent to which it generates rising incomes for the population. But stocks don\u2019t reflect incomes in general; they only reflect the part of income that shows up as profits.On the second point: When investors buy stocks, they\u2019re buying a share of future profits. What that\u2019s worth to them depends on what other options they have for converting money today into income tomorrow. And these days those options are pretty poor, with interest rates on long-term government bonds not only very low by historical standards but zero or negative once you adjust for inflation. So investors are willing to pay a lot for future income, hence high stock prices for any given level of profits.This may seem, however, to present a paradox. If the private sector doesn\u2019t see itself as having a lot of good investment opportunities, how can profits be so high? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that these days profits often seem to bear little relationship to investment in new capacity. Instead, profits come from some kind of market power \u2014 brand position, the advantages of an established network, or good old-fashioned monopoly. And companies making profits from such power can simultaneously have high stock prices and little reason to spend.In other words, while record stock prices do put the lie to claims that the Obama administration has been anti-business, they\u2019re not evidence of a healthy economy. If anything, they\u2019re a sign of an economy with too few opportunities for productive investment and too much monopoly power.So when you read headlines about stock prices, remember: What\u2019s good for the Dow isn\u2019t necessarily good for America, or vice versa.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Line Rises in Initial Public Offering, Cheering Skittish Tech Industry", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byThe Line Corporation, the owner of a Japanese instant messaging app with a colorful cast of cartoon characters, cheered the technology industry on Thursday when its shares jumped 30 percent in their American trading debut.The strong showing offers hope for tech firms and their financial backers that Wall Street investors are warming up to closely held technology start-ups. But experts say Line is an unusual case of an established company with operating heft and a proven way to gin up sales \u2014 something that many new tech companies lack.Line itself still faces considerable hurdles, such as slowing user growth and an untested plan to use advertising to help make it profitable.Line\u2019s American depositary shares, priced at $32.84 each on Monday, jumped to $42.70 in early trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is expected to begin trading in Japan on Friday.Line\u2019s debut coincided with another new high for the equity markets in the United States. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has surged 8 percent since June 27, after Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union roiled stocks worldwide, as investors anticipated additional stimulus from central banks.Global uncertainty has hurt the market for initial public offerings. The value of I.P.O.s dropped to $50.7 billion so far this year from $107.9 billion for the same period last year, according to Dealogic, a data provider. In technology, the value dropped to $4.9 billion from $13.3 billion.Line\u2019s I.P.O., the largest tech offering since First Data went public in October 2015, is likely to encourage others. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the tech market that there is one large scale I.P.O. happening,\u201d said Serkan Toto, a game industry consultant in Japan.But Line also has some unique qualities. The service is well established, having begun start five years ago as a way for Japanese people to communicate after the devastating earthquake that year. It is controlled by Naver, a large South Korean company with a number of other internet businesses. It claims 218 million monthly active users, many of them in populous Southeast Asian markets, prompting industry observers to compare it to other established social media networks like Facebook and Twitter.It has also posted strong revenue growth by selling its users what it calls stickers: small, often animated cartoon characters that include Disney and comic book figures as well as its own menagerie of in-house mascots. Stickers can sell for about $2 each. \u201cThe customers are engaging with the brand, liking it,\u201d said Neha Dharia, a senior analyst at Ovum. \u201cCustomers are seeking out the brand.\u201dThat encourages investors who see potential in Line to make a significant amount of money from advertising \u2014 an area where Twitter and others have struggled to turn millions of eyes into a steady revenue stream. Nearly one-third of its revenue comes from advertising. Like other Asian chat apps, such as China\u2019s WeChat and South Korea\u2019s KakaoTalk, it is also increasingly a platform for services that allow users to hail rides or order food.\u201cAsia\u2019s mobile messengers such as Line, KakaoTalk, and WeChat are now making money,\u201d Yongjei Jeong, an equity research analyst for Mirae Asset Securities, wrote in an email.In terms of making money, Line is not quite there yet. It posted a $2 million loss in the first three months of the year as rising employee costs and other expenses offset revenue growth, though its loss narrowed sharply compared with a year earlier.Line\u2019s user growth has also slowed, raising questions about whether it can expand beyond its markets. \u201cLine has been restricted to Japan and pockets of Southeast Asia,\u201d Ms. Dharia said. \u201cTo replicate that experience in other markets, it takes a lot of effort.\u201dIn other markets, a lack of hit games and an underused newsfeed feature will make it vulnerable to competitors like Facebook, said Mr. Toto, the game industry consultant in Japan. Leveraging its dominance in its existing markets \u201cis Line\u2019s only chance,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of their core markets, it\u2019s game over.\u201dLine in Japan referred questions to representatives in the United States, who did not respond to requests for comment, and to the company\u2019s filings.Line could give a sense of how well it is doing in advertising when it publishes its second-quarter earnings at the end of this month. Investors will also be looking for whether the company increases marketing or strikes a deal to get into new markets. \u201cThey have a lot of cash after the I.P.O.,\u201d said Jaemin Ahn, an internet and media analyst at NH Investment & Securities.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "More on the Short-Run Macroeconomics of Brexit", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "I\u2019ve received several thoughtful responses from economists I respect, all making a particular argument about the effects of Brexit-induced uncertainty. It goes like this: right now, firms don\u2019t know how closely Britain will be tied to Europe, so it makes sense for them to postpone investments until the situation clarifies.This is an interesting and defensible argument \u2014 basically, that the unclear shape of Brexit creates an option value to waiting. But I have three questions about it.First, is this really the argument underlying all of these dire post-Brexit forecasts? My guess is that very few people reading news reports, or even briefing papers, about Brexit are hearing this; what they\u2019re getting is much closer to the notion that uncertainty = increased probability of bad things. That is, this argument is a lot more nuanced and subtle than anything I previously heard in this discussion.Third, doesn\u2019t this argument suggest essentially the same effects from any policy negotiation whose end result isn\u2019t known? Why don\u2019t we say that the possibilities of TPP or TTIP are contractionary, because firms have an incentive to postpone investment decisions until they know whether these agreements actually happen? Somehow, though I\u2019ve never heard anyone argue for the depressing effects of pending trade liberalization.Again, I\u2019m not trying to defend Brexit. But I worry that the urge to condemn it has led to a lowering of intellectual standards.And let me also say that the narrative of disaster is coloring some (not all) financial reporting. On the whole, the market reaction looks pretty muted to me. It\u2019s not just stocks: European bond spreads are about where they were a month ago. True, globally, rates are considerably lower; but we aren\u2019t seeing the kind of financial disruption so widely predicted. Yet headlines about turmoil are everywhere.Could I be wrong about all of this? Of course! But everyone really should ask where the consensus about Brexit macro is coming from.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Under normal circumstances, the transaction would be handled to minimize that risk, saving the client money.This is where the front-running came into play. The bank employees bought British pounds before placing the client\u2019s order, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say, expecting that the large transaction would raise the price of the pound. The client trade was set up to be done in two stages roughly 40 minutes apart in the early afternoon on Dec. 7, 2011. The HSBC employees had already bought pounds in the days leading up to the transaction and, while they were executing it, they traded in a way that pushed up the price of the pound even more, something the prosecutors call \u201cramping.\u201dProsecutors on Wednesday cited a phone call between the defendants during which they discussed how high they could ramp the price of the pound \u201cbefore the victim company would \u2018squeal,\u2019\u201d the complaint said. The price was the highest that day for that type of currency trade, allowing the traders to generate significant profits. How significant?

{"Headline": "3 More Property Funds Halt Withdrawals After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Three more asset managers suspended redemptions in their British property funds on Wednesday as concerns mounted about the potential impact that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union would have on the real estate market, particularly on the booming property market in London.Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Henderson Global Investors and Canada Life each temporarily suspended trading in their British property funds, bringing the number of fund managers who have put a hold on customer exits to six since Monday.Redemptions are on the rise as investors look for havens after the surprise outcome of the June 23 referendum on whether to exit the European Union.Uncertainty after the vote has sent the pound tumbling and jostled stock markets around the world. On Wednesday, the pound fell to a new 31-year low against the dollar, while the FTSE 100, an index that tracks the biggest stocks traded in London, fell 1.25 percent.The strain has been particularly acute at property funds in Britain, which promise to provide daily liquidity to investors, but hold assets that are often difficult to sell quickly, like office buildings or shopping centers.By suspending redemptions, these type of funds want to avoid a cycle of selling that could force them to sell assets at ultralow prices and prompt more investors to seek an exit.Adding that it was \u201cmindful of the fact that a 17 percent impact on fund pricing may lead shareholders who have placed redemption orders to reconsider their decision,\u201d Aberdeen said it would suspend trading until noon on Thursday to allow investors to cancel withdrawal requests.Columbia Threadneedle said its portfolio managers maintained a cash balance in its Threadneedle UK Property Authorised Investment Fund to satisfy redemptions because of the time it takes to sell property.The asset manager said it had not been immune to a recent increase in withdrawals by retail investors, but had still been able to meet redemption requests with the fund\u2019s cash on hand.\u201cHowever, it is expected that these requests to sell will continue for the time being due to uncertainty in the market following the U.K. referendum result, therefore the temporary suspension of dealings allows sufficient time for the orderly sale of assets and protects the interests of all investors,\u201d Columbia said in a statement.Early this week, Standard Life, Aviva Investors and M&G Investments each suspended exits from their property funds.The Bank of England warned on Tuesday that a fall in commercial property prices in Britain could be \u201camplified\u201d by investors and real estate funds.These types of direct property funds \u2014 where the fund itself owns the building or property outright \u2014 represent a small piece of the mutual fund world.Yet they have accounted for a growing share of investment in commercial real estate in Britain in recent years.

{"Headline": "How Excessive Executive Pay Hurts Shareholders", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn theory, \u201cpay for performance\u201d \u2014 linking executive pay to a company\u2019s stock price \u2014 aligns the interests of executives and shareholders. It\u2019s supposed to ensure that executives are not tempted to enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders, who are too numerous and far-flung to influence a company\u2019s behavior.In practice, it hasn\u2019t quite worked that way. Instead, beginning around the 1970s and becoming increasingly common since the leverage-buyout era of the \u201980s, the defining characteristic of pay for performance has been an explosion in chief executive pay that exceeds the value that any human being who isn\u2019t Midas could reasonably be credited with producing. In 2015, the median pay package for chief executives at 200 large United States companies was almost $20 million per year, nearly 400 times the pay of a typical worker.The study, by Wintergreen Advisers, a money management firm, looked at two hits that shareholders absorb from executive stock awards. The first hit is well known. When a company issues shares under an executive-pay agreement, the increase in the number of shares outstanding dilutes the value of existing shareholders\u2019 stakes.The second blow, involving share buybacks, is less obvious. Buybacks, in which management reduces the number of publicly held shares by repurchasing the company\u2019s stock, are often pitched as a way to boost a company\u2019s earnings per share. But the study points out that buybacks are aimed not necessarily at benefiting shareholders, but rather at offsetting the dilution that results from awarding stock to executives.That observation is reinforced by the fact that corporate buyback activity increases when stock prices are high \u2014 exactly the opposite of what prudent investing would dictate. In all, the study estimates that the shareholder costs of the dilutions, and the buybacks to reduce that dilution, at companies in the S.&P. 500 index amounted to 4.1 percent of each company\u2019s shares outstanding and 10.2 percent at companies with the highest combination of awards and buybacks. That implies a hefty sum of shareholder money spent to funnel money to executives. Research into the motives and consequences of share buybacks is continuing, so other approaches could yield different figures, but even the lower estimates would represent a significant cost to shareholders.Excessive executive pay is deservedly blamed for rising income inequality, because worker pay has stagnated as executive pay has soared. But it has not been as widely faulted as a drag on shareholders because the durable pay-for-performance narrative still persuades many investors that they benefit when executives are lavishly rewarded. The Wintergreen study suggests otherwise, that oversized awards can mean diminished shareholder wealth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stretch of Market Volatility Makes It Stormy at the Top", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe stock market at midyear hovered around a record high. But after several disturbing weeks in which prices soared, then plunged, then soared again, the view from the summit, or near it, may not be so pleasant.Stock fund owners escaped the second quarter with modest gains, but the extreme volatility leaves them to contemplate fresh uncertainties in the final half of 2016.Share prices were advancing steadily until British voters decided in a referendum on June 23 to leave the European Union. Although polls showed a close race throughout the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign, the result came as a shock \u2014 one that evidently wore off quickly, as stocks fell precipitously but then recovered nearly all of the Brexit losses in the final days of the month.The British vote overshadowed a far less surprising decision earlier in June by the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates. Explaining the Fed\u2019s thinking to a Senate committee, Janet L. Yellen, the central bank\u2019s chairwoman, highlighted \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about the economy.Whatever uncertainties investors faced, in whatever corner of the world, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended June at 2,098.86, up 1.9 percent for the quarter.The post-Brexit bounce \u2014 after the post-Brexit swoon \u2014 helped to produce a 2.5 percent return for domestic stock funds in the quarter, according to Morningstar. The average international stock fund rose 1.4 percent, but portfolios in Europe lost 3.4 percent.Even if the British referendum had gone the other way, American stocks might have been vulnerable to a decline, albeit not necessarily all at once, and after their rebound, they may be vulnerable to one again. The S.&P. 500 ended the quarter trading at 19 times the earnings that component companies reported in the previous four quarters, compared with a historical average of about 15.Not only are valuations high, but earnings growth is low and expectations are falling. Analysts estimated earnings of $118.79 for the 2016 S.&P. 500 at the end of June, according to FactSet Research, a figure that has declined in each of the last six quarters.The conundrum that investors face heading into the second half is that alternative destinations for their money aren\u2019t cheap, either. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for instance, declined in the second quarter to 1.4 percent from 1.78 percent. That helped the average long-term government bond fund gain 6.5 percent, and bond funds in general rose 2.6 percent.Some niches within the markets \u2014 stocks of companies in one industry or region, bonds from certain types of issuers \u2014 may offer adequate return prospects at acceptable risk, investment advisers say. But they warn that gains are likely to be meager at best in broad asset classes. Few options are good; some may be good enough.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find real pockets of value in the financial markets today,\u201d said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. \u201cI don\u2019t see much where you can say, \u2018Aha! This is a great opportunity.\u2019\u201dNeither does Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates. He blames the Fed and its peers for much of the situation.\u201cThe mainstream markets that most people rely on are generally pretty expensive, with anemic yields,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks deserve most of the credit for that, basically blowing bubbles all over the world.\u201dBut not everywhere.\u201cIf you look outside the mainstream markets, you see some bargains,\u201d Mr. Arnott said. \u201cThe lowest-hanging fruit is emerging-market stocks. They\u2019ve been in a brutal five-year bear market.\u201dIn contrast to American stocks, indexes of emerging markets are trading at less than 10 times earnings. Emerging-market bonds are similarly cheap, in his view, with yields at a greater premium to those on Treasury debt than at any time since 1998, during the Asian financial crisis and Russian debt default.\u201cWhen you see spreads this wide, it makes sense to put a large toe in the water,\u201d he said.Traders displayed no such circumspection when it came to British and Continental European stocks and currencies after the Brexit referendum. They took stock indexes down nearly 10 percent in just a few hours and sold the euro and especially the pound, which fell more than 10 percent, to its lowest level since 1985, and failed to recover with stocks.Comments from global banks after the referendum were mixed. Deutsche Bank called the result \u201ca sign of Europe\u2019s increasing fragility\u201d and warned that \u201cthis outcome points to greater risks.\u201d The S.&P. 500 could fall to 1,950, Deutsche said, and banks and companies with high European sales are particularly vulnerable.UBS Wealth Management advised staying the course, treacherous though it may be.\u201cGiven considerable uncertainties, we would encourage investors not to sell down risk assets in a time of heightened market volatility and lower-than-average liquidity,\u201d the bank said in a note to clients. \u201cWe are confident in the prospects for positive returns for U.S. equities.\u201dFocusing on the outlook for emerging markets, HSBC said there probably would not be much direct impact on business. The bank cautioned, however, that \u201cthe U.K.\u2019s referendum decision to leave the E.U. means we are entering an uncertain world and there will likely be pressure on emerging-market financial assets based on immediate risk aversion.\u201dJeremy Richardson, a manager of stock portfolios for RBC Global Asset Management, said that the world was plenty uncertain before June 23 rolled round.\u201cA big question that hangs over all of us is, How do we move on from this world of low, even negative, interest rates that we find ourselves in?\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks are running out of policy tools; that creates a level of uncertainty. Perhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why equity markets have not been more robust.\u201dMr. Richardson recommends avoiding long-term bonds or the stocks of companies that investors may view as proxies for them for their stable trading patterns. Their popularity has made them expensive, just like bonds, he warned.He prefers stocks of \u201cbusinesses that do things a little differently,\u201d including discount clothing retailers and the carmaker Tesla. He also likes companies involved in cloud computing and so-called big data, as well as immunotherapy, or the development of cancer treatments that enhance immune system responses to tumors.\u201cPeople spend so much time on what Janet Yellen is going to say next or the price of copper and tin\u201d instead of focusing on individual companies, Mr. Richardson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just talking about the market, you\u2019re missing a big part of the story.\u201dBut central banks remain a big part of the story, too. However the Fed and its peers might go about extricating themselves from nearly a decade of extraordinary monetary policy, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, wishes they would just get on with it.\u201cWe have uninterrupted growth with full employment,\u201d he said. It\u2019s no longer appropriate, he said, \u201cto employ crisislike policies when the crisis is long past in the U.S.\u201dThough he considers the economic backdrop benign, Mr. Paulsen acknowledges that valuations are quite high, so he envisions \u201cmidsingle-digit buy-and-hold returns\u201d and expects the S.&P. 500 to trade between 1,800 and 2,200 in the second half.He favors sectors like financial services, industrials and materials and would avoid consumer sectors, where prices have been bid up. Foreign markets may do better than the United States, in his view, because they are less further along in the upward slope of their economic cycles.Other niches that Mr. Paulsen would consider include market-neutral and other alternative funds, which try to achieve modest returns with minimal risk, and real estate and commodity funds, in case the Fed loses control and inflation begins to stir.Ms. Patterson at Bessemer cautioned that all manner of developments, from terrorism to slowing growth in China, could cause turmoil in the markets this year, and she reminded investors that the Brexit referendum wasn\u2019t the only vote that must be factored into asset prices. She expects some companies to hold off on hiring and investment decisions as the presidential election draws closer.\u201cEven with a benign outcome\u201d to the various sources of uncertainty, she said, \u201cgiven valuations and the outlook for profits, being neutral in equities makes sense.\u201dAmong the few assets she prefers in the present climate are high-quality corporate bonds and shares of global companies that tend to trade with less volatility than the overall market, as long as they are also reasonably priced.If such slim pickings and the prospect of slim returns leave investors feeling disappointed, Mr. Paulsen has a simple piece of advice: Get over it.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the world you live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much available anywhere.\u201d Trying to make the best of a mediocre situation, he added: \u201cThe best of this bull market is long past, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its flavor hints at turned earth or wood broken down by rain, a funk wonderfully, perilously close to rot.Beside it is risotto, arborio rice gone cloudy and fat in white wine and a stock of fennel and artichoke scraps, finished not with cheese, but peas freshly shucked and tasting still new to the world.Dawa Bhuti runs the restaurant with her father, Ngodup Gyaltsen, and an uncle, Lobsang Tenzin. Her family roots are in Dzonga, Tibet, a village in the Himalayas at an altitude of some 13,500 feet.It is a place she has never been. She was born across the border, in Kathmandu, Nepal, and she spent much of her youth in India at boarding schools for Tibetan refugees, before coming to New York in 2004 at 20.The front side of the menu, posted at each table on a small chipped clipboard, is hers, devoted to brunch dishes (served all day) of almost Californian lightness. These may include a pale soup of leeks and radishes, inscribed with basil oil like a memory of another alphabet, or baked eggs under a litter of summer squash and garlic scapes.Pan-seared wild cod, in folds of soft corn tortillas, comes armed with half-spears of asparagus. A rosary of chickpeas dusted with Ethiopian berbere is strewn among lettuce leaves so vivid, they look as if they were still beaded with dew.The cooking is lovely, if occasionally more dramatic in appearance than flavor.

{"Headline": "What Can the United Nations Do When Its Troops Can\u2019t, or Won\u2019t, Protect Civilians?", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byTheir track record, however, shows that they have not always been able or willing to do that.On Wednesday, as senior United Nations officials warned of the risks of renewed fighting between rival South Sudanese factions after deadly clashes over the weekend, Security Council diplomats met behind closed doors to discuss whether to send more troops or give them new orders.They agreed on little, diplomats said. And so it remained unclear whether the Council would move anytime soon to impose an arms embargo on the warring parties, as the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon has called for, or whether they could agree on a political strategy to make the peacekeepers\u2019 job any easier.The United Nations said that its troops patrolled the streets of Juba, the capital, on Wednesday for the first time in days, only to discover that food stocks had been looted from its warehouses. The United States announced that it would charter two planes to allow its citizens to leave Juba.\u201cFurther clashes cannot be ruled out,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Ladsous, the United Nations under secretary general for peacekeeping.Over the weekend, United Nations troops were under lockdown in their bases in Juba as government forces put up checkpoints and thousands of civilians poured in. Gunmen fired at civilians trying to enter the United Nations bases, which also came under fire. Two peacekeepers were killed inside a base, along with at least eight civilians.\u201cSomething is fundamentally wrong with the mandate of the U.N. mission here,\u201d Zlatko Gegic, the country director for Oxfam, said by Skype from Juba this week. \u201cThey were victims themselves, being completely unable to move.\u201dThere are 13,000 troops and police officers on the ground now, nearly half of them assigned to protect displaced people sheltering in their bases, known as protection of civilian sites.Some of South Sudan\u2019s neighbors are calling for the mission to be fortified with a special unit that could intervene militarily, as peacekeepers were allowed to do against a militia in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a far trickier proposition in South Sudan, however, as an intervention could embroil United Nations troops in an incendiary ethnic conflict.Two investigations for events in Malakal, by panels appointed by the United Nations, suggested that some peacekeepers had retreated from their posts and that others had waited for written instructions from headquarters. Both acts contravened the mandate set by the Security Council: to protect civilians, by deadly force if necessary.While the troops dithered, according to one of the investigations, gunmen threw grenades into the camp, singled out civilians based on their ethnicity, and went on a looting and burning rampage. When peacekeepers finally advanced, 16 hours after the attack began, and fired into the air, the gunmen withdrew.By then at least 30 people had died, and at least 123 had been wounded.\u201cWhile some peacekeepers performed bravely, some of those with the responsibility to protect civilians did anything but that,\u201d David Pressman, an American ambassador at the United Nations, said in an email shortly after a closed-door Security Council meeting on what happened in Malakal.\u201cThis was a horrific event,\u201d he said. \u201cIt merits a serious response and accountability, certainly for the uniformed perpetrators who killed innocents but also for peacekeepers who may have failed to carry out their responsibilities.\u201dSouth Sudan is a vast, largely roadless country of rivers and swamps \u2014 and of deadly ethnic fault lines. A full-scale civil war broke out in December 2013 when soldiers loyal to the president, Salva Kiir, took up arms against followers of the vice president at the time, Riek Machar. Mr. Kiir\u2019s loyalists belong mainly to his Dinka ethnic group, while Mr. Machar is a Nuer. The two men signed a peace accord in August, but it remains, for now, limited to words on a page.Roughly two million people have been forced from their homes, with nearly 200,000 living inside United Nations bases that were never meant to become camps for so many people for so long.One of the camps was in Malakal. According to one of the internal investigations, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, someone cut a hole in the fence that encircled the camp, about 50 feet from a United Nations sentry post staffed by Ethiopian soldiers. Two Dinka men tried to smuggle in two Kalashnikovs through the hole, plus 58 rounds of ammunition. Peacekeepers tried to detain them, but the smugglers escaped.Through that hole in the fence, over the course of the next day, most of the camp\u2019s ethnic Dinka residents left.Uniformed soldiers loyal to Mr. Kiir assembled on the edges of the camp. By late that second day, clashes broke out inside. The peacekeepers deployed one platoon to try to disperse the crowd. The soldiers fired tear gas.It was not enough to deter the troublemakers. A grenade was thrown into an ethnic Shilluk section of the camp. A fire broke out in the Nuer enclave. The Dinka sections were left intact.By morning on the third day, the report said, witnesses saw South Sudanese troops inside the camp, along with armed men in civilian clothes and white scarves masking their faces. The report concluded that the attack \u201cseems to have been well planned and orchestrated by local authorities.\u201dAs for the United Nations forces, only at 2:30 p.m. did they respond with force, advancing in four armored personnel carriers and firing into the air.The second internal inquiry recommended \u201cdecisive action\u201d against units that were unwilling to use force, including by repatriating entire units or individual commanders.As always, the tricky part for the United Nations is confronting countries that provide armed forces for its missions, especially those that send many troops, without which peacekeeping operations could not exist. Countries that had contingents in Malakal \u2014 Ethiopia, India and Rwanda \u2014 are among the largest troop contributors.In a measure of the political difficulties, the under secretary general for peacekeeping, Mr. Ladsous, told reporters in mid-June that some of the soldiers would be sent home. He declined to reveal their nationalities. A month later, none of the troops had been repatriated, and given the latest surge of violence, it is unlikely any of them will be anytime soon.Now, as the Security Council tries to strengthen the United Nations mission, the question remains: What can peacekeepers be expected to do in South Sudan?\u201cThe argument for keeping the mission in place is that, by guarding civilians at its protection sites, it mitigates the overall violence,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut a lot of the sites seem to to be insecure, and the risk of a large-scale massacre at a U.N. base is serious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Plan for Banks Could Roil Europe", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byEven as Europe grapples with repercussions of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, a dispute over tens of billions of dollars is also threatening to roil the region\u2019s $16 trillion economy.The Italian government, according to some estimates, needs to spend $45 billion to shore up its banks burdened with bad loans. Fears that European authorities will bar the government from providing that support are adding to the turbulence caused by \u201cBrexit.\u201dIt may seem difficult at first to understand how the lenders of a medium-size country, none of which are particularly large, or engage much in risky Wall Street activities, could be spreading fear through global financial markets.But they are, and their problems reveal what can happen when well-intentioned regulations bump into reality. And this is creating tension among the leaders of Europe. The situation may drag through the summer, keeping investors around the world on edge.So how bad could this get?The steep declines in shares of Italian banks suggest that a storm is ahead. The stock price of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, one of Italy\u2019s most troubled lenders, is down 80 percent in the last 12 months. Its shares also trade at under 10 percent of its book value \u2014 a measure of its net worth \u2014 a sign that investors really think that the bank needs new capital. Also, when bank stocks sink that much, banks find it almost impossible to raise new capital in the markets.The good news is that, over all, Italy\u2019s banks don\u2019t appear to need an overwhelmingly large sum to get them on a firmer footing. The problem centers on the banks\u2019 approximately 200 billion euros, or about $222 billion, of bad loans.The banks have already set aside significant reserves to absorb losses in these loans, effectively valuing them at 40 percent of their original value, according to some analyses. Investors appear to think that these loans are worth even less, however.The theory is that the banks would now have to bite the bullet and value the loans at an even lower level. But this could produce losses, and some banking experts say \u20ac40 billion of support is needed to help the banks take those hits.A simple response would be for the Italian government to hold its nose and plow that sum into the banks, roughly mimicking what the United States government did with its TARP spending in 2008.But such a bailout may be illegal under relatively new European rules that aim to protect taxpayers and instead force investors in the banks to provide financial support in times of trouble. Investors lend money to banks by buying their debt securities. Under the anti-bailout rules, those securities would be forcibly turned from debt into new equity, which could absorb any new losses taken on the bad loans. Under such a so-called bail-in, the equity would in theory be worth less than the debt securities, leading to losses for investors who held the debt.It sounds straightforward, but in Italy it is not.Retail investors hold many of those debt securities. According to Bruegel, a research organization that specializes in European economic issues, families own about a third of Italian banks\u2019 debt securities. Not only would bail-ins focus the pain on Italian households, the fear of losses might also prompt investors to stop lending to banks and lead depositors to withdraw their money. This would make a bad, but manageable, situation much worse.A compromise doesn\u2019t look impossible, though.Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing the specifics of Italy\u2019s problems and wary of the stresses caused by Brexit, may decide that it makes sense to give Italy a pass this one time.And the rules provide ways to do that. There are, for instance, exemptions in Europe\u2019s \u201cstate aid\u201d rules that aim to force bail-ins. One kicks in if a bail in could have \u201cdisproportionate results.\u201dDan Davies, senior research adviser at Frontline Analysts, says the Italian government could argue that forcing losses on retail investors would fall under that exception.So if Italy does bail out its banks, will they stop being a problem? Will they resurface as a destabilizing force two summers from now?To stop that happening, analysts say that government support must come with a plan to overhaul the industry. Mr. Davies said that mergers would help, if done at valuations that make sense.Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments, a hedge fund, says that moves must be taken to make the industry much more efficient than it is.\u201cThis injection would need to come with a restructuring of the system,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Rich People Make the French Squirm", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byParis \u2014 MY family was once invited to lunch at a chateau owned by a friend of a friend. As we drove our rental car up to the giant castle, my kids gasped and said, \u201cThey must be rich!\u201d\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t mention money,\u201d I warned them.An hour later, I found my 6-year-old walking in circles on the lawn, talking to himself. Up close, I realized that he was muttering \u201cmoney, money, money, money\u201d over and over.Can the French overcome their ambivalence about money to lure bankers from London? Should they?This ambivalence goes back centuries. Aristocrats were guillotined during the French Revolution, and new taxes were based on how wealthy people appeared \u2014 measured in part by the number of doors and windows in their homes. The well-off learned to be discreet.There are still plenty of rich people in Paris, of course. One draw for finance companies is that the city is teeming with high-end restaurants and grand apartments, and that it already has a large business district, La D\u00e9fense, just west of town. Whole neighborhoods of the capital empty out each summer, as residents retreat to their second homes.But there are still rules against showing it off. Parisiennes rarely walk around wearing the giant diamonds that are de rigueur in certain New York neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s more in a private dinner that you see the wealth,\u201d a French friend explained.It\u2019s fine to discuss money in France, as long as you\u2019re complaining that you don\u2019t have enough, or boasting about getting a bargain. No one here appreciates the American thrill I get from overspending, any more than they understand why we have a national holiday (Thanksgiving) during which you\u2019re practically obliged to overeat.The typical \u201cFrench dream\u201d (or at least the one people admit to) isn\u2019t of great wealth, it\u2019s of great security, including a steady income and pension. When you apply for a mortgage here, banks don\u2019t care what stocks you own, because stocks can go down; they want to see a monthly salary and a permanent work contract.I see this principle in daily life. When I told a Paris official that a group of parents was willing to buy a new security camera for our children\u2019s school (the city had been dragging its feet on our request), he was aghast, saying, \u201cWhat about the other schools where parents can\u2019t afford to buy new cameras?\u201dMr. Valls urged executives here to remind their British counterparts that the infamous 75 percent tax is gone: \u201cIf some among you can be patriotic and explain to the British media that it doesn\u2019t exist anymore, I\u2019d be thankful.\u201dBut the welcome is not without reservations. Jean-Louis Missika, Paris\u2019s deputy mayor for urban planning and economic development, told me in an interview this week that Brexit also offers a cautionary tale about what happens when the superrich dominate a city, pricing out practically everyone else. In London recently, I visited friends at the peak of middle-class careers who are living crammed with their children in a one-bedroom rental. There are people in northern England \u2014 many of them voted for Brexit \u2014 who can barely afford a coffee in the capital. Paris isn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s more affordable.Mr. Missika said that France still faced \u201ccomplicated and difficult, but urgent questions\u201d about how much it was willing to cut taxes to attract financial companies. \u201cI say yes to finance, but to an ethical one that respects fiscal rules\u201d and the environment, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said on Wednesday.\u201cI think we have to roll out the red carpet,\u201d said Mr. Missika, who worked in private equity himself. \u201cBut if rolling out the red carpet means aligning French taxes and finances with what was practiced in London or Jersey, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious. It\u2019s not possible. And I hope that neither Germany nor the Netherlands nor any of the other cities that are competing with Paris will make that big mistake.\u201d He predicted that sectors of the financial industry will cluster in different cities.Paris is meanwhile stepping up its efforts to attract technology companies, start-ups and so-called creative-economy jobs, which Mr. Missika said are more connected to the rest of the city and will help develop it over the long term. Paris will no doubt get some finance jobs, too, but I doubt it will ever become the next London. It doesn\u2019t really want to be that. And it\u2019s probably right.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Get Stung Twice by Executives\u2019 Lavish Pay Packages", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byFair GameIt\u2019s a frustrating fact of life for many mutual fund investors: Even if they\u2019re distressed by outsize executive compensation at public companies whose shares they indirectly own, chances are good that the votes cast by their investment managers actually encourage delusional pay.In recent years, as executive pay has climbed, fund managers have continued voicing their approval for stratospheric compensation packages. The failure by these fiduciaries to use their power to rein in pay has led some critics to contend that the managers aren\u2019t viewing the packages in the context of what they cost company shareholders.Cost No. 1 is the dilution for existing shareholders that results from these grants. As a company issues shares, it reduces the value of existing stockholders\u2019 stakes.A second cost to consider, Mr. Winters said, is the money companies pay to repurchase their shares in trying to offset that dilutive effect on other stockholders\u2019 stakes.\u201cWe realized that dilution was systemic in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500,\u201d Mr. Winters said in an interview, \u201cand that buybacks were being used not necessarily to benefit the shareholder but to offset the dilution from executive compensation. We call it a look-through cost that companies charge to their shareholders. It is an expense that is effectively hidden.\u201dMr. Winters and his colleague Liz Cohernour, Wintergreen\u2019s chief operating officer, totaled the compensation stock grants dispensed by S.&P. 500 companies and added to those figures the share repurchases made by the companies to reduce the dilution associated with the grants.What they found: The average annual dilution among S.&P. 500 companies relating to executive pay was 2.5 percent of a company\u2019s shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the costs of buying back shares to reduce that dilution equaled an average 1.6 percent of the outstanding shares. Added together, the shareholder costs of executive pay in the S.&P. 500 represented 4.1 percent of each company\u2019s shares outstanding.Of course, these numbers are far greater at certain companies. The 15 companies with the highest combination of dilution and buybacks had an average of 10.2 percent of their shares outstanding.\u201cIt\u2019s not only today\u2019s expense,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cIt\u2019s that the costs of dilution over time have been going up, so you have a snowballing effect.\u201dHere are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.Wintergreen Advisers has been critical of executive pay for some time. Two years ago, the firm led the charge against executive pay at Coca-Cola, arguing that the stock awards given to Muhtar Kent, the company\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., were excessively dilutive to existing shareholders\u2019 stakes. Last year, the company reduced Mr. Kent\u2019s grants by almost half.And yet, though Mr. Kent\u2019s total pay fell by 42 percent in 2015, with a package of $14.6 million, he is not headed for the poorhouse.Not all companies give executives loads of stock grants. Mr. Winters provided four examples with far less dilution related to compensation plans than is typical in the S.&P. 500. Only one is in that index: the Altria Group, the tobacco company, with 0.7 percent average annual dilution.The three other companies are European: British American Tobacco, with zero dilution; Nestl\u00e9, with 0.1 percent, and the Swatch Group, with 0.6 percent.Mr. Winters contended that the circular arrangement of stock grants and buybacks was especially costly at companies in the S.&P. 500. One reason, he said, is that many of the large money management firms offering index funds and exchange-traded funds do not generally vote against pay packages at the companies whose shares they own on behalf of their clients.Why these companies don\u2019t take a more aggressive stance on pay issues is something of a mystery. Some critics speculate that it may be because their own executive pay is high, or that they don\u2019t want to alienate corporate clients, whose money they manage, by voting against their pay.When asked about their votes in support of lavish pay, money managers often contend that when they see problems with a company\u2019s compensation, they talk privately with its board to try to effect change.It engages with these companies, and if they don\u2019t take action, State Street will vote against their compensation, Ms. McNally said. Last year, she said, State Street voted against pay practices at almost half the 1,424 companies it had selected for review.But this kind of engagement process is slow, frustrating investors who are eager for a quicker pace of change in pay plans.Highlighting the erosion of their wealth that lush executive compensation can mean for investors might just light a fire under more money managers. And to this end, Ms. Cohernour, the Wintergreen C.O.O., suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission help by requiring companies to include in their annual proxy statements both the dilution that their executive stock grants represent and the cost of the buybacks conducted to offset it.\u201cCompanies could easily make this information clear in their proxy materials instead of making investors dig through documents for it,\u201d Ms. Cohernour said. \u201cThese are significant factors for an investor to know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Standard Life Fund Halts Withdrawals After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byA British mutual fund with large investments in London commercial real estate said on Monday that it had suspended requests from investors wanting to exit the $3 billion fund.The decree from Standard Life Investments, the asset management unit of the large British insurance company, was a response to panicked investors looking to pull their assets following the vote by Britons last month to sever ties with the European Union.Standard Life\u2019s U.K. Real Estate Fund invests in high-end commercial properties in London, which over the years have soared in value. But the decision by a majority of British voters to leave the European Union has raised questions about London\u2019s future as a financial and commercial hub and the worth and stability of its booming real estate market.The move is also causing jitters among traders who have long worried about mutual funds that invest in assets that are hard to buy and sell, such as commercial real estate and junk bonds, but that also promise to return cash to investors on demand.Mutual funds in Britain that invest in London property markets have been popular, especially in recent years when aggressive central bank policies pushed interest rates to zero, creating a reach for yield mentality among investors large and small.Although described as British investment funds, many of them are in effect big bets on the London malls, office towers and elite residential developments with total allocations in some cases approaching 40 percent of the fund. In a booming market, buying such properties is easily done. But they are much harder to sell, especially in a down market, because they do not trade on an exchange and are thus difficult to value.The announcement from Standard Life Investments came toward the end of the day\u2019s trading in London and during the Independence Day holiday in the United States, so it will not be until Tuesday when traders will be able to gauge the impact of the move on markets, which closed last week on a strong run.In a statement, the firm said that \u201cfollowing an increase in redemption requests as a result of uncertainty for the U.K. commercial real estate market following the E.U. referendum result,\u201d it had halted redemptions and that the suspension would end \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201dLast week, Standard Life and other fund managers like Aberdeen and Henderson had reduced the value of their commercial property investments \u2014 the large majority of which do not trade on securities markets \u2014 after the referendum result by 3 percent to 5 percent.Last December, a mutual fund run by Third Avenue, which invested in the riskiest types of high-yield bonds, was forced to bar the door to investors who wanted their money back. Even though the fund company had hundreds of millions of dollars of cash on hand, panic redemption requests from investors could not be satisfied because the mutual fund\u2019s securities were almost impossible to unload.The decision spooked regulators, in particular the Securities and Exchange Commission, which have long worried about the ability of mutual funds to meet investor demands in a time of broad market panic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Understand About the Trade Deficit", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThis is an updated version of an article that first ran on March 27, 2016. One consistent theme from Donald J. Trump in his campaign for the presidency is this: The United States is losing at trade, and the trade deficit is the evidence.\u201cWe\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money, according to many stats, $800 billion a year on trade,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cSo we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion. That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s smart to me.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, eliminating the trade deficit would not, on its own, make America great again, as Mr. Trump promises. In fact, trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics.Getting rid of the trade deficit could very well make America less great. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.Imagine a world where there are only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLandites got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, in fact, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dMaybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But when a country runs a trade deficit, as the United States does, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million, and both of the two options have consequences.One option is to keep that money at home. But keeping that money inside CarNation will push the value of its currency upward. And as its currency goes up, cars will become more expensive in BananaLand \u2014 causing people there to buy fewer of them until eventually the trade deficit is eliminated.If CarNation doesn\u2019t want its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.The choice is stark: A country running a trade surplus must either let its currency rise or let money flow back to its trading partners.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; and new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so good. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger, and American exporters less competitive, than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.The key idea is that if a President Trump or any other future leader really wants to reduce our trade deficits in a major way, that leader is going to have to rethink the very underpinnings of global finance.Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article was first published in March and was updated to reflect Donald Trump\u2019s most recent comments on the trade deficit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "HSBC Bank Executives Face Charges in $3.5 Billion Currency Case", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe global banking giant HSBC has repeatedly found itself in the cross hairs of American regulators and prosecutors in recent years. To settle allegations of money-laundering and mortgage abuses, it has paid billions of dollars \u2014 but has not been criminally charged.That has spurred an outcry that the bank is \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d But now two senior executives of HSBC face criminal charges, accused of a currency manipulation scheme that federal prosecutors say generated $8 million in profits and fees.The global head of HSBC\u2019s foreign exchange cash trading desk, Mark Johnson, a Briton, was arrested by federal agents Tuesday night at Kennedy International Airport as he was boarding a flight to London.He and Stuart Scott, the former head of the bank\u2019s currency trading desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to a transaction on behalf of a corporate client, exchanging dollars for British pounds.The charges are a boon to the Justice Department, which until now has not mounted any cases against individuals in its wide-ranging investigations into currency manipulation by the major banks.\u201cThis case demonstrates the criminal division\u2019s commitment to hold corporate executives, including at the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated institutions, responsible for their crimes,\u201d said Leslie R. Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division.The case against the two men resembles a conventional insider trading scheme, but with a twist because the defendants traded in currencies instead of stocks.HSBC was hired to convert dollars into British pounds for a company as it was preparing to complete the sale of a subsidiary. The complaint does not identify the client, but it was Cairn Energy, according to a person with direct knowledge of the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Cairn, a midsize oil and gas company based in Edinburgh, was selling its Indian subsidiary to Vedanta Resources, an Indian conglomerate owned by the mining magnate Anil Agarwal.The two HSBC executives are accused of using their knowledge of the deal to trade ahead of the $3.5 billion currency transaction, \u201cramping\u201d up the price of one currency to benefit the bank at the expense of its client.Federal prosecutors are expected to charge two HSBC bankers with fraud in connection with a $3.4 billion foreign exchange transaction in 2011.The criminal complaint unsealed on Wednesday detailed conversations between Mr. Scott and Mr. Johnson discussing how high they could \u201cramp\u201d up the price of the currency before the company would \u201csqueal.\u201dIn the Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson, 50, was released on a $1 million bond secured by $300,000 cash and his house in Britain. A lawyer for Mr. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.It is unclear where Mr. Scott, who is 43 and also a British citizen, is currently located.The case is being led by federal prosecutors in the office of Robert L. Capers, the United State attorney in Brooklyn.But HSBC was not among five banks that agreed last year to plead guilty to felony charges in connection with manipulating the price of dollars and euros. Those banks agreed to pay criminal fines totaling more than $2.5 billion.HSBC has previously said the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the bank. It has set aside an additional $1.3 billion for further potential settlements, according to a filing last summer.Robert Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, which is based in London, said on Wednesday that the bank had been and would continue to cooperate with the Justice Department\u2019s foreign exchange investigation.While HSBC was not implicated in Wednesday\u2019s criminal complaint, the case is another black eye for the London-based bank that has substantial operations in the United States.In 2012, it paid $1.9 billion in fines to United States authorities to settle allegations of being a conduit for illegal money. The deal included a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office and the Justice Department.The Justice Department\u2019s decision not to criminally charge HSBC in that case received renewed scrutiny last week, when a report prepared by Republican staff of the House Financial Services Committee showed that prosecutors at the Justice Department wanted to criminally charge the bank, but were overruled by top officials in the department, including the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr.And HSBC paid $550 million in 2014 to settle allegations that it made billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities appear to be compliant with regulations.The latest case stems from 2011, when HSBC was one of 10 banks that were invited to bid for the right to execute the currency transaction on behalf of Cairn Energy. Each competing bank was required to sign a confidentiality agreement.In its bid submission, HSBC pledged it could \u201cprovide one quote for the full amount or even drip feed the market in the utmost confidential nature so as to ensure there are no sudden FX moves against the company,\u201d according to the complaint.But when HSBC won the bid in October of 2011, it did the exact opposite, the complaint says. After securing the lucrative job, a supervisor at HSBC told Mr. Scott on a call that the bank did not want to \u201cpush the market too much\u201d higher \u201cand at the same time we want to make money on this,\u201d according to the complaint.Mr. Johnson and Mr. Scott began to buy British pounds in exchange for other currencies, which they later sold for a profit to HSBC on the day of Cairn\u2019s currency deal on Dec. 7, the government said.In a call to discuss the details of Cairn\u2019s transaction with HSBC, Mr. Scott \u201cfalsely and fraudulently\u201d advised representatives at Cairn on the best time of the day to execute the trade, according to the complaint.When an adviser working on behalf of the company questioned Mr. Scott\u2019s logic, he added that if traders in the market were aware of the transaction, \u201cthey will try to jump in front and start to muck around in the markets,\u201d according to the complaint. Mr. Johnson also gave his own personal recommendation along the same lines.Minutes after the call ended, Mr. Scott and Mr. Johnson began aggressively buying up pounds.When Cairn representatives did notice the sudden spike in the price of the British pound and asked HSBC, the person was told the spike in trading was the result of a Russian bank buying pounds at the same time as Cairn.Mr. Johnson, according to the complaint, was surprised to learn that Cairn Energy decided to go ahead with the multibillion-dollar currency transaction, even as his trading in the markets had caused the price of the currency to soar to its highest point of the day.Responding to the news, Mr. Johnson replied, \u201cOhhhh, Christmas,\u201d using an expletive as an adjective.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ralph Lauren\u2019s Turnaround Plan Has Parallels of Ford Motor\u2019s Road Map", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseWhen the Ralph Lauren Corporation recently unveiled a turnaround plan, calling it \u201cThe Way Forward,\u201d it unwittingly invoked another all-American icon fallen on hard times: Ford Motor, whose \u201cWay Forward\u201d plan in 2006 saved the automaker from bankruptcy.Ford\u2019s success has become a staple of business school case studies. And much of the current Ralph Lauren strategy seems inspired by the Ford playbook \u2014 enhancing a venerable but financially challenged brand by slashing costs, reducing the work force, closing stores and improving quality.At first blush, a cyclical automaker and a retail fashion designer would seem to have little in common. But like Ford before its recent renaissance, Ralph Lauren is a globally recognized symbol of American style and expertise that, in recent years, has faced growing competition, changing consumer tastes, steep discounting and slumping sales and profits.Ralph Lauren\u2019s still-new chief executive, Stefan Larsson, told me this week that he didn\u2019t consciously name his plan after Ford\u2019s, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m a fan of Alan Mulally,\u201d Ford\u2019s former chief executive, he said. But he seems to have reached a similar place on his own.\u201cI spent the first three months at Ralph Lauren assessing the strength of the brand and business,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Larsson, 41, who was part of the team that built H&M into a fast-fashion powerhouse and then led a widely admired turnaround at Gap\u2019s Old Navy division.\u201cI realized quite soon the brand is much stronger than the business,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Larsson said. \u201cThat excites me. The brand is one of the few global iconic brands. We\u2019re going to build the business by going back to the core of what made the brand unique and original.\u201dThat Ralph Lauren, the company, would need a turnaround surely comes as a surprise to many, given its long cultivation of an image of effortless affluence and confident style.Ralph Lauren himself, a still-youthful 76, remains the company\u2019s chief creative officer and executive chairman. He built the company by evoking an idyllic past from which hard times were banished, taking inspiration from Ivy League college students, prewar British aristocrats and frontier cowboys. Mr. Lauren, in essence, made an upper-class aura accessible to everyone, from Hollywood starlets and hip-hop artists to countless people of humble origins and means. Few, if any designers have had so much impact on American style and taste.His designs and marketing captured a singularly American faith in upward mobility and assimilation. No wonder he put a version of the American flag on his sweaters and, with his initials where the stars would be, made it the company logo. America\u2019s athletes will be wearing his designs in August at the Olympics in Rio, as they did in London four years ago and in Beijing in 2008.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will ever be another Ralph Lauren,\u201d said the fashion journalist Teri Agins, author of the books \u201cThe End of Fashion\u201d and \u201cHijacking the Runway.\u201d \u201cThere isn\u2019t any question that he\u2019s a genius.\u201dStill, she added, \u201cWhat goes up must come down.\u201dLately, the descent has been steep. Since hitting a peak of $188 almost exactly three years ago, the company\u2019s shares have plunged by more than half, to less than $90 this week. After beating Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates for 14 consecutive quarters, in February 2015 Ralph Lauren stock had its biggest one-day plunge ever when it missed estimates and lowered forecasts. Since then it\u2019s gotten worse.Revenue growth went from a healthy 7 percent in 2014, to 2.2 percent in 2015, to a negative 2.8 percent in fiscal 2016, which ended in April.Can Ford\u2019s shrink-to-grow approach work for a fashion brand?Investors have been skeptical, apparently unnerved by the prospect of imminent losses and worse-than-expected forecasts. Ralph Lauren shares, which closed at $96.33 on June 6, the day before the company announced its \u201cWay Forward\u201d plan, were trading around $91 on Thursday.But turnarounds take time. Ford slashed its work force by 30,000 and closed 14 manufacturing plants while spending heavily to introduce new products and improve quality. It used the entire company, even the Ford logo, as collateral to borrow $25 billion.There was no immediate payoff for Ford shareholders. Ford lost more than $30 billion over the next three years, as the financial crisis and ensuing recession slammed auto sales. Ford stock went from over $8 a share in 2006 to less than $2 in 2009, a far worse decline than Ralph Lauren. But Ford returned to profitability in 2010. Last year it had $8.7 billion in profit, and shares traded this week at $12.40, a more than sixfold gain.Ralph Lauren is starting its turnaround effort from a much stronger position than Ford. The company is still making a profit \u2014 $582 million last year. Its reputation for quality remains high, unlike that of the American automakers before the financial crisis. It doesn\u2019t have a heavily unionized work force.But Ralph Lauren\u2019s profit was over $1 billion just two years ago. The company has been buffeted by forces beyond its control, including declining department store sales, the rise of fast-fashion chains, the shift to online retailing, and greater price consciousness among consumers. In trying to adapt while still pursuing growth, Ralph Lauren seems to have lost its focus.\u201cI\u2019d say the Ralph Lauren brand has become a little confused,\u201d said Neil Saunders, an analyst and managing director at Conlumino, a retail research and consulting firm. \u201cThe design credentials are still very strong, but the brand has become a little staid. Brands that have seen growth, like Burberry and Ted Baker, have something Ralph Lauren doesn\u2019t, which is a bit of quirk. Ralph is still carving out his traditional aesthetic. It\u2019s consistent, but younger consumers aren\u2019t as interested as they used to be.\u201dMr. Lauren has transformed his company into a quintessential American label with its ubiquitous logo of a mounted polo player holding a raised mallet.Ms. Agins agreed that millennials, in particular, were causing problems for traditional fashion brands. \u201cThey look at these fast-fashion brands, like Zara and Uniqlo, with good fashion and good prices, and ask, \u2018Why pay more?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel they need the cachet of a Ralph Lauren. They\u2019ll cherry-pick, buy a little of this and that, rather than stay with the high-end brand.\u201dMr. Larsson is fully aware of the problems. \u201cWe had diluted our focus with too many brands and too many initiatives,\u201d he acknowledged. As part of the \u201cWay Forward,\u201d he said the company would close 50 underperforming locations, lay off 1,000 employees, eliminate three layers of management, streamline the supply chain and concentrate on just three core brands.Mr. Larsson said his aim was to make the company even more of a reflection of Mr. Lauren by taking it closer to Mr. Lauren\u2019s original vision.\u201cIt fascinated me, in going through the archives, that Ralph\u2019s early work is the closest to the core,\u201d Mr. Larsson said. \u201cI looked at the imagery of Ralph and his family in Montauk. That resonates with what consumers dream of today. In interviews with young people and influencers, it struck me that they admire what Ralph stands for, and that he has remained true to his creative idea. We\u2019re as relevant to a new creative generation as we were to an older generation. We just have to make it current and evolve the product, marketing and shopping experience.\u201dThat can be a delicate balancing act. Two years ago, Coach, the venerable American leather goods concern that shares many of Ralph Lauren\u2019s problems and opportunities, embarked on a similar turnaround aimed at slashing costs and lifting profitability. Under the direction of a new chief executive, the Coach veteran Victor Luis, it said it would close numerous stand-alone stores in malls, improve its department store locations, open a new flagship in New York City, revamp its product line to re-emphasize its classic roots and curb discounting.Investors were skeptical then, too, sending Coach shares plunging from $50 to just over $34.Two years later, it\u2019s too soon for Coach to declare victory, but signs are encouraging. In April, Coach beat analysts\u2019 estimates and said third-quarter profit jumped 22 percent and revenue increased 11 percent. Shares were over $40 this week, up 23 percent this year. (Last month, Ralph Lauren poached Jane Nielsen, Coach\u2019s chief financial officer, to help oversee the \u201cWay Forward.\u201d)Ralph Lauren is a stronger brand than Coach.\u201cI only took this job because I believe in the brand and I believe that Ralph\u2019s original vision can be more relevant than ever,\u201d Mr. Larsson said. \u201cWe just need to execute in a way that brings that to life for the consumer.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of headwinds beyond their control, and they have their work cut out for them,\u201d Ms. Agins said. \u201cBut Ralph Lauren has the brand, the quality, and the American cool factor. They can fix it.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with the Common Sense column, about turnaround efforts at Ralph Lauren, omitted a credit. The picture, of the Lauren family at Montauk in the 1970s, supplied by the Ralph Lauren Corporation, was taken by the late Barbra Walz and should have been credited to her estate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Goldilocks Strategy for Prudent Investors", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byRetiringARE you saving for retirement but worried about how to handle a sudden, unexpected expense? Or already retired and wondering how best to protect yourself against a stock market loss?Many people with those fears set aside a so-called rainy-day fund, keeping large sums in their bank accounts or money market funds. This is a costly mistake, rivaled only by the excess fees too many investors pay to high-cost money managers.When I ask people why they do it, they say things like \u201cin case I wreck my car\u201d or \u201cin case my house burns down\u201d or \u201cin case I have a medical emergency.\u201d But problems of this sort require large cash outlays only if you are not insured. And the remedy for this is to make sure you are adequately insured, rather than create a big rainy-day fund that earns vastly inferior rates of return compared with stocks and intermediate-term bonds.You will need a lot of cash, of course, when you retire or if you join the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Under those circumstances, however, you will need that money over a protracted period of time. There is no reason that the resources to finance this spending stream should take the form of low-interest bank deposits or money market funds, which inevitably will fail to keep up with a rising cost of living, even if inflation remains modest.Instead, to minimize the real risks we all face in meeting our unknown, long-term financial obligations, you need a different strategy, one that produces reliable, spendable cash flow and superior returns, minimizing the likelihood that the inflation-adjusted value of your portfolio will decline over time.The best way to achieve those goals is to avoid \u201cperfectly safe\u201d cashlike assets, relying on your savings account or money market funds only for a 30- to 60-day cushion to cover your day-to-day obligations, plus enough extra at times to satisfy those occasional outsize expenses like a child\u2019s college tuition bill that is due in the next few months.After that, your primary goal is to build wealth. Not surprisingly, equities do best. That\u2019s why most of your money for your retirement should be invested in stocks.But you may not have realized that intermediate-term bonds, over the long run, are superior not just to cash but to long-term bonds as well. So when thinking about where to invest your fixed-income assets, remember Goldilocks: The best place to be is not too long and not too short.The return you expect to earn and the risk associated with bonds rise as maturity lengthens. But the rates at which they rise are neither uniform nor equal. At first, as you move out of cash into short-term bonds your expected return rises rapidly, but risk \u2014 if we define it as the chance that you will lose to inflation \u2014 actually diminishes.That\u2019s why the shortest-maturity investments like money market mutual funds and Treasury bills are among the worst investments you can make.As you then extend your maturity from short-term bonds to intermediate, the increase in return slows down and risk begins increasing, but the trade-off between the two seems commensurate. Extend your maturity beyond intermediate, however, and the additional expected return that you gain seems wholly inadequate compared with the amount of extra risk incurred.With long bonds you are at the mercy of the inflation gods: If inflation is low enough, you can win big; if it\u2019s high enough, you get buried.The moral of the story: Don\u2019t put your money in long bonds (too risky) and don\u2019t put your money in money market funds or bank accounts. The latter give up way too much return for the (supposed) perfect safety of zero fluctuation in the value of your investments.Instead, the place to be is what is essentially a large \u201csweet spot\u201d between short and intermediate. That\u2019s where the reward-risk trade-off is at its greatest.But what about those of you who have been investing in long-term bonds, which have done very well since the early 1980s? All I can say is: Fabulous market timing! As Morningstar reports, for the 34 years ending 2015, long Treasuries offered a compounded return of 10.1 percent per year, a pace that was much better than intermediate Treasuries\u2019 7.5 percent and not all that unfavorable compared with stocks\u2019 11.5 percent.But it\u2019s worth remembering that at the end of 1981 long Treasuries were yielding more than 13 percent and were about to begin a decades-long decline that produced hefty capital gains. With long-term Treasuries now yielding just 2.3 percent (and yields on non-Treasuries not much higher), you are all but certain to have inferior returns on long bonds unless we enter an extended period of deflation. With the unemployment rate at a low 4.7 percent and underlying inflation running around 2 percent, I would not bet on that.Indeed, long-term bonds can be a horror show. Over the long period that stretched from 1940 to 1981, long-bond returns averaged 2.2 percent while inflation advanced at a 4.7 percent annual rate. The value of such assets dropped nearly 63 percent in real terms, even if you never spent a dime. After taxes, you would have lost 70 to 75 percent of your money.Fortunately, not many investors keep a large share of their funds in long bonds. Many more fall prey to the irrationally strong preference for perfect stability: Bank accounts and money market funds capture almost 30 percent of individual investors\u2019 liquid financial assets.That\u2019s a sucker\u2019s game, with no chance to earn the higher coupons that are routinely paid by bonds with modestly longer maturities. For the 90 years ended 2015, investors gave up 1.7 percent a year, compounded, if they stuck to Treasury bills instead of being willing to invest in intermediate Treasuries.Obsessing over downside risk costs investors a great deal of money, reducing their standard of living in retirement. And speaking of not obsessing over acceptable risks, it\u2019s even better to avoid Treasury securities in favor of low-cost mutual funds that invest in either corporate or municipal bonds. The extra yield these bonds pay (after tax) swamps the tiny costs they incur on those rare occasions when bond issuers default.The point of accumulating assets is not so that you can spend them down quickly in retirement, for once you spend them, you are broke. The point is to mainly rely on the income they produce.And, of course, income does not mean simply nominal income, but real (inflation-adjusted) income. And in this regard, equities do best, while within the universe of fixed-income investments, intermediate maturities offer you the best odds of beating inflation during the course of your lifetime.David A. Levine is a former chief economist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., now a unit of AllianceBernstein, who also founded and ran the firm\u2019s fixed-income department.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Timing May Be Right for Investors to Seek Protection", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byStocks have shown no clear trend in more than a year; valuations are high and corporate earnings have been weak.The market at last reached new highs this month. It may well continue to rally, but it will have to do so against a backdrop of weak corporate earnings, a less accommodating Federal Reserve and lingering uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s vote in late June to leave the European Union.The combination of difficult fundamental conditions and a stock market that has had such trouble getting over the hump could make this a good time for owners of equity portfolios to start playing defense. The most obvious way to do that is to sell stocks and hold more cash and other assets, but there are alternative strategies that can keep investors in the game. An important consideration in determining which, if any, defensive approach to use is whether an investor is focused on the short or long run.\u201cTime horizon is key in terms of how much anyone will care about this,\u201d said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar, the investment research firm. \u201cIf you\u2019re investing long term, you don\u2019t get too worked up about it, but for people in or near retirement, it does seem reasonable to protect against the downside.\u201dAssuming you want to buy actively managed mutual funds, her preferred tactic is \u201cbuying a fund that has played good defense in the past,\u201d she said. Managers of funds that fit the bill tend to have an especially keen eye on value and will build a big stockpile of cash if they are unable to find enough stocks at reasonable prices. Examples that Ms. Benz offered included the F.P.A. Crescent and the AMG Yacktman Service funds.Mark Balasa, chief investment officer of the financial advisement firm Balasa Dinverno & Foltz, also considers an investor\u2019s time horizon important when it comes to protecting a stock portfolio against a decline. But in a way his strategy is almost the reverse of what Ms. Benz has in mind.If the aim is more tactical, to guard against an imminent decline, \u201cthat involves some form of timing the market, which is very difficult to do,\u201d Mr. Balasa warned. But he is happy to hold funds with solid defensive characteristics for the long term, no matter the market environment.\u201cPart of our screening process is to look at performance in up and down markets,\u201d Mr. Balasa said.He advised against placing too much emphasis on defense, however. \u201cIf the downside capture is good,\u201d he said, using a term for resilience in falling markets, \u201cthen the upside is capped. As a long-term hold, that\u2019s a challenge.\u201dInstead of looking solely for funds that hold up particularly well in downturns, Mr. Balasa seeks out those whose managers concentrate on high-quality stocks. This group would also largely figure in the first type of fund, although the overlap isn\u2019t perfect. High-quality stock include those of companies with consistent earnings histories or feature strong dividend growth, or both.\u201cWe do that all day long, not just because we think the market is going to be all that volatile, but because long-term exposure makes perfect sense,\u201d Mr. Balasa said.BlackRock\u2019s iShares and Vanguard have exchange-traded funds that tweak benchmark stock indexes to put extra weight on high-quality companies, he noted, and asset management firms such as AQR and Dimensional Fund Advisors have mutual funds with similar approaches.Laurie Kamhi, managing director of LCK Wealth Management, considers funds that have demonstrated an \u201cability to find undervalued stocks for the long haul\u201d \u2014 for instance by focusing on companies that have healthy dividend yields or a history of increasing their payouts \u2014 to be resilient in downturns. Some funds that she mentioned were T. Rowe Price Equity Income, Vanguard Dividend Growth, the Oakmark Fund and the Oakmark Equity and Income Fund.Ms. Benz also liked Vanguard Dividend Growth and American Century Equity, another fund that emphasizes yield and quality.For investors who do want to make a tactical defensive play, Mr. Balasa suggested all-weather funds whose managers have the freedom to own defensive assets and take other steps to guard against declining stock prices, such as Pimco All Asset All Authority, G.M.O. Global Asset Allocation and BlackRock Global Allocation. But Mr. Balasa cautioned that the managers of those funds might not be inclined to take a defensive posture when their shareholders would like them to.Another way to play defense is to shift a portion of a portfolio into exchange-trade funds that specialize in sectors like health care and consumer staples that are coveted for their ability to outperform the market on the way down. A related tactic is to buy an exchange-traded fund that owns low-beta stocks, or those that are less sensitive than average to market movements.But sensible investment ideas often seem less so when more people have them, and that could apply to these types of funds right now. Ross Levin, founding principal of the advisory firm Accredited Investors, said that strong interest in low-beta stocks has elevated their price-earnings ratios to unacceptable levels.\u201cIf you look at multiples of the stocks that those funds tend to own, it\u2019s questionable whether they will be as defensive as people who buy them think,\u201d he said. \u201cThat safe sector is no longer safe as we understand it.\u201dThe same goes for other segments of the market that are ordinarily defensive, Ms. Benz said.\u201cIt looks like the high-quality patch is a little bit picked over, and staples look expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat idea has been out there for a while. Investors gravitating to this strategy may be a little bit late.\u201dAs an opponent of market timing, Mr. Balasa worried about investors being a bit late or early in whatever tactical moves they made. But he acknowledged that a sober decision to become more defensive now could be wise to prevent becoming more defensive in a moment of panic later on.\u201cLong term you\u2019re better off being invested,\u201d he said, but exercising more caution with a stock portfolio \u201ccan help on the behavioral-finance side. To tell someone to hang in there and stay the course wears thin very quickly\u201d in a bear market. Having a more defensive posture all along, he added, \u201carguably doesn\u2019t change clients\u2019 risk profile all that much, but it allows them to stay the course and not harm themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To grow, businesses must invest.

That\u2019s a bad sign for the company\u2019s outlook.Furthermore, most buybacks do not make sense for the shareholder. Sound investment advice is \u201cbuy low, sell high.\u201d Instead, data show that corporate buyback activity increases when stock prices are high, like now, and shrinks when stock prices are falling or low. However, the more likely reason is that buybacks boost the share price of executive stock options.The only positive appears to be the boost in share price by the reduction in the number of shares. So it would appear that a company buys back shares because its business outlook is poor, or that management hopes to please investors by raising the share price.The Securities and Exchange Commission should evaluate selected companies to learn whether stock buybacks have benefited shareholders over a market cycle.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rubens Provides an Upbeat Close to London Auction Season", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The Biblical story of how Lot\u2019s daughters seduced their father to sustain the family gene pool after escaping the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah might not seem the most obviously commercial theme for an artwork.But on July 7 at Christie\u2019s, \u201cLot and His Daughters,\u201d Rubens\u2019s recently rediscovered circa 1613-1614 painting of this taboo subject soared to 44.9 million pounds, about $58.2 million, bringing London\u2019s tumultuous \u201cBrexit\u201d summer auction season to an upbeat close.\u201cThe picture was not an easy one,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Haboldt said of \u201cLot and His Daughters.\u2019\u2019 He described this latest Rubens masterpiece as a \u201ctough subject,\u2019\u2019 but \u201ca spectacular piece of painting.\u201d The work had been estimated to sell for between \u00a320 million and \u00a330 million.\u201cRubens\u2019s time has come,\u201d said Mr. Haboldt, an old masters specialist with locations in Paris, New York and Amsterdam, who was the underbidder. He initially bid for a collector, who dropped out, then continued on his own behalf with an associate. \u201cIf you like Bacon, you can like Rubens. People look beyond the subject. It\u2019s all about painting, and this was a very representative picture by the artist.\u201d\u201cLot and his Daughters\u201d had been found by Christie\u2019s about a year ago in the London home of a descendant of the German banker and philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch de Gereuth, who had bought the work privately from the Duke of Marlborough in 1886. It was one of a much-prized group of virtuoso earlier paintings by Rubens \u2014 \u201cMassacre of the Innocents\u201d was another \u2014 made for wealthy Antwerp patrons and filled with references to the art he had seen during his travels in Italy in 1600-1608.Yet a spectacular price for a one-off trophy could not mask the systemic issues of both supply and demand that continue to face old masters. The previous evening, Sotheby\u2019s, which has been a dominant force in the London auction market for historic paintings, raised a modest \u00a316.5 million with fees from its own 43-lot sale, far below the \u00a339.3 million it took in last year.Sotheby\u2019s did manage to sell the finely detailed oil \u201cHollandaise \u00e0 la cafeti\u00e8re\u201d (A Dutch Girl at Breakfast) by Jean-\u00c9tienne Liotard, a mid-18th-century Swiss artist particularly admired for his pastel portraits. Billed as the last genre interior in oils by Liotard left in private hands, it was knocked down to the London dealer Lowell Libson, bidding on behalf of an institution, for \u00a34.4 million, a high for the artist at auction.But a 1629 still life of lemons and wine glasses by the Dutch painter Pieter Claesz with a low estimate of \u00a31.8 million, whose seller had been guaranteed a minimum price by Sotheby\u2019s, was among a hefty 35 percent of lots that failed (23 percent were unsold at Christie\u2019s).\u201cFor a change, Sotheby\u2019s didn\u2019t have such a good sale,\u201d said Johan Bosch van Rosenthal, an art adviser in Amsterdam who specializes in old masters. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty tough market at the moment. There are new people out there who haven\u2019t got a clue, and there is a larger group of old master buyers who used to be there, but who are now buying different things.\u201dMr. Outred\u2019s mystery Rubens client splashed out an additional \u00a37.2 million on three more lots of Flemish pictures, including \u00a36.5 million for Pieter Brueghel the Younger\u2019s four-panel series of \u201cThe Seasons.\u201d On the internet, an American outbid a Russian to pay a low estimate \u00a3218,500 for the painting \u201cA Boy Peeling Fruit\u201d by an \u201cassociate\u201d of Caravaggio. Another, more fully attributed version of this Caravaggio composition, estimated at $3 million to $5 million, failed to sell at Christie\u2019s New York in January 2015.But dealers, who have been struggling to sell their existing stocks of old masters in their galleries and at fairs, were conspicuously inactive as buyers at these evening sales. Christie\u2019s said that just 3 percent of the value of its \u00a365.4 million auction was represented by trade purchases.\u201cThe dealers aren\u2019t bidding,\u201d said the London gallerist Jean-Luc Baroni. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. Everyone knows what you have paid for a painting and there are certain things that are completely out of fashion.\u201dDealers were instead trying to find their own buyers at the fourth London Art Week promotion, featuring 46 galleries in Mayfair and St. James\u2019s.This latest edition, which ended on Sunday, showed that at least some younger dealers were eager to find ways to broaden the client base for historic art. The new partnership of Andrea Lullo and Andreas Pampoulides, for example, opened their Cork Street gallery with the exhibition, \u201cClassicism Reimagined,\u201d consisting of more than 20 paintings and sculptures ranging in date from the third century B.C. to 1950.Although the gallery made at least one undisclosed sale of about \u00a3600,000, it also offered entry-level pieces, like the circa 1860 Robert Macpherson photograph of the celebrated classical sculpture \u201cLaocoon and His Sons,\u201d which sold for \u00a32,500.While the early 17th-century canvas, \u201cA Philosopher Holding a Mirror,\u201d by Jusepe de Ribera, priced at \u00a31.25 million with Colnaghi, was the only seven-figure sale to be confirmed, London Art Week attracted curators from more than 40 museums, according to the organizers. For dealers, this kind of gallery-based promotion, when timed to coincide with major auctions, can be an attractive alternative to fairs.Exceptional auction prices, such as the $44.9 million bid for that Rubens \u2014 or indeed the five-times estimate \u00a31.1 million given by an English collector at Bonhams on July 6 for the earliest known self-portrait by the early 17th-century British painter William Dobson \u2014 create a sense that the old master market is at least ticking, if not booming.But the salesrooms, with their powerful marketing machines, tend to attract the few new buyers for the less fashionable field of historic art, tempting dealers to sell through the auction houses rather than their own galleries.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a new generation of collectors yet,\u201d said Mr. Van Rosenthal, the art adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s about education. And people need to get over the idea of investing in art.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Company Will Give a Peek Inside How Much Private Start-Ups Are Worth", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byNow Equidate, a market for trading shares of private companies, plans to lift the veil on some of that information. The company, based in San Francisco, said on Monday that it would make a host of data about private companies free and open to the public, drawing from corporate filings that include the prices that investors have paid to invest in the companies. Equidate also plans to release tools that shareholders can use to calculate the value of their private-company stock holdings.\u201cWe\u2019re giving away this data to help create a more robust market and to give stakeholders like employees, investors and other shareholders a better way to understand the value of their stock,\u201d said Sohail Prasad, a co-founder of Equidate.To buoy the market for private-company shares, a handful of start-ups have worked to increase transparency and liquidity. Apart from Equidate, the start-up eShares lets privately held companies electronically issue and manage their shares so that investors know who owns what piece of the company at any given time.While information about private companies does exist, it is typically fragmented or hard to find in corporate filings without paying thousands of dollars a year to data-service companies. With Equidate\u2019s new data service and tools, investors can easily see what the current share price of a private company like Lyft might be on the Equidate marketplace and compare it with the price that venture investors and other institutions paid in the past.\u201cFor the last few years, a lot of companies raised money without having to share much data,\u201d said Semil Shah, an investor with Haystack Fund, a venture capital firm. \u201cThings have swung in the other direction.\u201dMr. Shah said that nearly everything about the private markets is opaque, including what information is shared between companies and their potential venture investors, and even between the venture firms and the investors whose money they manage. While the lack of disclosure can help entrepreneurs by giving them time to build businesses without scrutiny and can help venture investors negotiate more favorable deals, it can also increase risks for investors who may not fully understand what they are buying, he said.\u201cThese issues stemmed, in part, from the fact that secondary-market investors did not have access to accurate information concerning the value of the companies in which they were investing,\u201d Ms. White said.An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on Equidate.Mr. Prasad says Equidate, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by a group of technology investors, has been working with regulators since 2014. In January, Equidate bought a regulated broker-dealer, which means that the deals made on Equidate must comply with securities rules and have some investor protection and disclosure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Front in a Scarred Falluja", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byIn the last stages of the battle, members of the counterterrorism force, in coordination with other Iraqi units, fought their way into the neighborhood of Al Jolan in Falluja, where Islamic State fighters were making their last stand. As we moved through the bombed-out streets, gun battles raged, and the insurgents\u2019 improvised mortars exploded among the narrow alleyways and rubble in a last-ditch effort to halt the advance of Iraq\u2019s security forces.What, exactly, the Islamic State fighters were holding out for was lost on me. The city had been surrounded for months. Nearly all the civilians were gone, either driven out by their rulers\u2019 brutality in the early days, or escaping during breaks in the fighting as the Iraqi forces approached.The Iraqi Army, special forces and the federal police relied on heavy artillery, close air support from United States aircraft and a patient advance through the city.The remaining Islamic State fighters were forced to be opportunistic. During one visit with the Iraqi special forces, I saw a soldier who had been shot through his right calf, either by a sniper\u2019s round or random gunfire.Gruesome markers of the battle dotted the roads leading into Falluja.A charred body of an Islamic State fighter had been left on the side of a road that the Iraqi forces had bulldozed through a small field south of the city as they began the assault. A metal cable was tied tight around one of the body\u2019s legs, and the head had been lopped off.A police commander chastised two Shiite militiamen who were taking cellphone pictures of each other stomping on the corpse triumphantly.Much of the heavy fighting in Falluja was done by the American-trained counterterrorism forces.The units were designed for high-speed night raids and targeted extractions. Instead, as the fight to retake Iraq has turned into a series of urban battles and checkpoint fights, the small, specialized units have been called on for brute-force infantry assignments.For the counterterrorism units, Falluja was the latest in a long string of assaults. They have been sent wherever the fighting was heaviest and the target most critical while the government has struggled to reconstitute its failed and deserted regular army.It has left the elite units threadbare, run down.Islamic State fighters had built underground bunkers in homes they had commandeered. When the Iraqi counterterrorism forces moved in, they discovered steel doors covering holes cut in the marble and tile floors of the houses. In other buildings in the city center, storage bunkers held caches of weapons.As the Iraqi forces advanced block by block, courtyards and rooftops became vital vantage points, sniper nests and, despite the brutally hot weather, crash pads under the sun.During one of my final days in Falluja, Islamic State fighters hiding out in the city showered us with large mortar shells, probably made in a makeshift factory set up in someone\u2019s kitchen.The unit I was traveling with discovered large stocks of crudely made mortar rounds: improvised rocket-assisted mortars, or IRAMs.In one house, ordnance, including explosives, was piled in the kitchen. Other deadly ingredients \u2014 bags of ball bearings, rusty screws, nails and other shrapnel \u2014 were strewed about.Iraq has been at war since some of the soldiers were in grade school. But evidence of the Islamic State\u2019s brutality took aback even some of the most battle-hardened soldiers.One officer, who spoke openly only on the condition of anonymity, citing military protocol, told me that the Islamic State was different from the insurgents he was used to fighting. You can negotiate with insurgents, he said in English laced with military jargon he picked up from years of working with United States Special Forces, but the Islamic State fighters seemed to have embraced unbridled and inflexible savagery.Another officer, Lt. Hassan Almosawi, from Iraq\u2019s Emergency Response Brigade, took me to an Islamic State prison his unit had discovered in a once upscale neighborhood in central Falluja.Homes in the area were outfitted with bars on the doors and grated metal sheets welded over the windows. Some of the rooms \u2014 possibly for the female slaves \u2014 were furnished with fans, carpets, pillows and blankets.Nearby, we discovered a burned-out two-story home where the Islamic State had established a torture operation. A heavy chain with a hook at the end hung from the ceiling of a second-floor parlor, and car batteries were arrayed on the floor near the wall, connected to an AC/DC transformer.Across the street from the prison and torture chamber, in a former school, decomposing bodies were tangled in a hastily dug grave, left to rot in the 120-degree heat.The victims had been blindfolded and appeared to have been killed as the Islamic State fled the city.Almost 60,000 Iraqis who managed to escape Falluja were now stuck in the desert in Anbar Province. Though Falluja is on the doorstep of Baghdad, only 40 miles away, the authorities were limiting access to the capital for fear that retreating militants might try to infiltrate the city.The fleeing families have been forced to live in wind-battered camps in the desert, like the one I visited in Amiryat Falluja, south of the Euphrates River. Women and children sleep in the open, exposed to heat and gusts that whip the fine desert dust through the frames of unfinished trailers.Aside from a few older men, there are few men or boys in the camps. They have been taken to screening where the government tries to weed out possible Islamic State fighters. After weeks, some of the displaced families still have no word about what has happened to their men.Most of the forces securing Falluja and the surrounding area are Shiite. But the families, and the detained men, are Sunnis. And though there have been few verified reports of extrajudicial killings or abuse, the people\u2019s resentment and fear are being carried in whispers.Victory is never the end of the story here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Locked Up in Pakistan, a Banker Bets for Freedom", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byTheater | ConnecticutThe fraught geopolitics of the situation, as well as the economics, are not lost on the imam, played with suave elegance by Rajesh Bose. \u201cWe are prisoners of a corrupt country,\u201d he tells Nick sadly. He sees his organization as a surrogate government, fixing roads, providing vaccines, offering employment. But despite his intelligence and worldliness and his acute analysis of American society, Imam Saleem is not prepared for the corrosive effects Nick\u2019s trading skills will have on him. Mr. Akhtar, whose play \u201cDisgraced\u201d won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for drama, foreshadows these consequences with Dar, a low-level operative movingly played by Jameal Ali.Tending to Nick\u2019s everyday needs, Dar has picked up some basic principles of capitalism, and used them to leverage his cousin\u2019s potato crop into serious money \u2014 in dollars rather than rupees. Mr. Akhtar, whose parents came to the United States from Pakistan, has created nuanced, three-dimensional characters, and the shifting relationships among Dar and Bashir and the imam reflect the depth and complexity of his writing. Dar at first seems good-natured and unassuming, but he reveals a darker side as the story progresses. And when the play begins, Bashir seems little more than a London-bred thug, but when he becomes Nick\u2019s trading staff of one, his aggression takes on a new dimension. Mr. Bryant and Mr. Kaisi beautifully convey the subtle interplay as the prisoner becomes a mentor and his keeper becomes his student.\u201cThe Invisible Hand\u201d unfolds in brief, captivating blackout scenes, sharply directed by Westport\u2019s associate artistic director, David Kennedy, and brilliantly lit by Matthew Richards, who bathes Nick\u2019s cell in harsh daylight and eerie darkness, deftly evoking both the slow passage of time and the oppressive climate. Enclosed by jutting blue screens that alternate between transparency and opacity, Mr. Rigg\u2019s set underscores Nick\u2019s utter isolation. Credit for the play\u2019s nerve-jangling atmosphere must go also to the expert sound designer, Fitz Patton. Nick, of course, doesn\u2019t hear the pulse-pounding music that accompanies the blackouts in this superb production, but the audience is as aware \u2014 and unsettled \u2014 as he is by the constant buzzing of nearby drones and the rumble of distant explosions.In pursuing their own goals, Dar, Bashir and the imam will all become susceptible in different ways to the addictive properties of money, leaving Nick to wonder how, exactly, the invisible hand of the marketplace will turn this messy business into something beneficial. The audience, however, already knows, because Mr. Akhtar\u2019s not-so-invisible hand has fashioned a powerful and transfixing piece of theater.Advertisement"}

Nine of the 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index showed gains Thursday, and banks rose the most, 0.9 percent.For the second quarter, earnings at JPMorgan slipped to $6.20 billion, or $1.55 a share, from $6.29 billion, or $1.54 a share. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of $1.43 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Improving results from its Main Street and Wall Street divisions helped push up the firm\u2019s overall revenue 3 percent, to $25.2 billion, from a year earlier.Goldman Sachs reported a 78 percent jump in quarterly profit as the Wall Street bank earned more from bond trading and its expenses fell.Mr. Dimon wrote that the move was driven in part by his optimistic outlook and would allow his employees to share in the economic growth.And on Thursday, the bank sounded a relatively optimistic note about the potential impact of Britain\u2019s recent vote to leave the European Union.\u201cWe see this as a political and economic challenge, but not a financial crisis,\u201d Ms. Lake said.Before the vote, Mr. Dimon had warned that JPMorgan might have to move thousands of employees out of Britain if it opted to leave the European Union.Ms. Lake said on Thursday that the company would decide on any moves only after the exact terms of Britain\u2019s exit had been negotiated.\u201cIt\u2019s very early days \u2014 things will unfold very slowly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would like to believe that we can continue to have our European franchise headquarters based in London.\u201dThe trading activity around \u201cBrexit,\u201d as Britain\u2019s decision to exit the European Union is called, appears to have helped the results from JPMorgan\u2019s trading divisions, and particularly its bond and fixed-income units.

They helped determine turnout, which helped decide elections. Their strategy centered on geographic balance.One of their last great convention victories came on this day in 1944, when they replaced on the ticket President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s vice president, Henry A. Wallace, with Harry S. Truman, a Missouri senator.Truman wasn\u2019t the top choice of likely Democratic voters. A Gallup poll that July found that 65 percent preferred Wallace, and Truman came in eighth place, with just 2 percent.Roosevelt didn\u2019t want him either. The three-term president said that if he were a delegate, he would back Wallace, whom conservative party bosses opposed. Roosevelt\u2019s wishes were ignored, and when a delegate tried to enter the vice president\u2019s name for the nomination, the day\u2019s proceedings were quickly adjourned.The decision was momentous, as Roosevelt died less than three months into his fourth term and Truman ascended to the presidency.

{"Headline": "Karl Case, Economist Who Developed Home Price Index, Dies at 69", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byKarl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College who helped revolutionize how home prices are tracked by real estate professionals and home buyers alike, died on July 15 in Wellesley, Mass. He was 69.Mr. Case had Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple myeloma and died in a hospice near his home, his wife, Susan, said.While the daily ups and downs of prices for stocks and bonds have long been easy to obtain and analyze, the housing market was much more opaque when Mr. Case teamed up in the 1980s with a Yale economist, Robert Shiller, to develop an economic model to track home values.The two collected information like the price of the same property over time as it changed hands, and tweaked the data to account for reliability and other quirks. This created what has become the benchmark for gauging the value of the single biggest investment most Americans own: their home.The Case-Shiller Index charted the remarkable rise of housing prices in the bubble that preceded the Great Recession, its subsequent bursting, the sharp declines in 2008 and 2009, and the slow but steady recovery in the real estate market since then.Both men warned before the recession that the housing market was getting ahead of itself. Mr. Case presciently sounded the alarm about the danger posed by rising subprime borrowing in the decade before the financial crisis.\u201cHe was more connected to the business world than most academics,\u201d Mr. Shiller said in an interview. \u201cHe also talked to people in the real world, like home appraisers, in order to isolate data for housing prices, which wasn\u2019t easy.\u201dKarl Edwin Case, who was known as Chip, a childhood nickname, was born in New York City on Nov. 5, 1946, the son of Karl Case, a banker, and the former Lillian Collier, a homemaker.Mr. Case graduated from Miami University in Ohio in 1968 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and then spent three years in the Army, running field hospitals in Vietnam at the height of the war there.He met his future wife, Susan Galbraith, when the two were undergraduates at Miami. They married in 1969.In addition to his wife, an education consultant, Mr. Case is survived by a daughter, Kristen Case, an English professor at the University of Maine at Farmington; a half brother, George Calnan; and two grandchildren.Mr. Case began teaching at Wellesley after earning a doctorate in economics from Harvard in 1976. His focus on housing was propelled by the real estate boom in the Boston area in the 1980s as computer companies there, like Digital Equipment Corporation and Data General, prospered, foreshadowing the current boom in Silicon Valley and other tech-driven areas.Mr. Case was introduced to Mr. Shiller by Sharon M. Oster, a Yale economist and colleague of Mr. Shiller\u2019s. The two men found they had complementary interests that would prove useful as they developed and expanded their index.Mr. Shiller had studied bubbles in the bond and stock markets; Mr. Case was an expert on taxes and incentives, as well as low-income housing.As they developed their model for broader use, Mr. Case and Mr. Shiller also showed that housing prices were not necessarily rational. Like the prices of stocks, home values are susceptible to momentum and human impulses like fear and greed.In 1991, the two worked with Allan Weiss, a management consultant who had studied with Mr. Shiller at Yale, to develop their model commercially. They sold it to Fiserv in 2002. Mr. Case retired from teaching at Wellesley in 2010.From tracking four cities, the Case-Shiller data has expanded to cover dozens of cities and thousands of ZIP codes, as well as providing national benchmarks.Their creation is now produced by Standard & Poor\u2019s and CoreLogic and is known as the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.\u201cWhat Case and Shiller put together is really the gold standard for price changes in the housing market,\u201d Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard, said in an interview. \u201cIt has the beauty of being both transparent and reliable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then, over half a century later, Alston\u2019s own son becomes determined to explode the myriad notions about the assassination that still obsesses conspiracy theorists. All three narrative threads turn out to wrap around Philip Hastings, a tormented hit man who stands at the center of a noirish storm of corruption, violence and depravity.A lot can go wrong when an author juggles stories like a street busker. When Alston is dragged into a cellar after being slugged from behind, he pronounces a line some readers might relate to: \u201cIt\u2019s all too complicated to absorb.\u201d But if we can\u2019t quite conjure with the multiple whiplash twists, the novel\u2019s headlong pace keeps us reading.Baker also gives us some standard noir elements: the shadowy landscape of Los Angeles, the obligatory violence (the \u201cface split open like an overripe fig\u201d), the alluring femme fatale in a black negligee. And he leavens his dark fantasy with real characters, including mob bosses like Sam Giancana and celebrities like Sal Mineo. Kennedy himself appears in a cameo, in bed with a floozy at a Manhattan hotel, his \u201cgleaming white teeth\u201d making his face \u201clook even more tanned by contrast.\u201d Here Lee Harvey Oswald is \u201cthe patsy,\u201d and a \u201cMurder on the Orient Express\u201d kitchen-sink cast of characters \u2014 Mafia gangsters, Dallas cops, C.I.A. spooks \u2014 all have parts in the killing. But at the core of \u201cFever City\u201d is the sorrowful, all-too-real geography of Dealey Plaza, the terrain of history, \u201cone huge killing field\u201d that lends this alternative tale its heft.When it comes to historical mirrored worlds, an author\u2019s success can be measured by the ability to create a story that, despite being preposterous, feels altogether real. Thus Zelitch\u2019s novel wonders what might have occurred if World War II had resulted in a Jewish homeland located not in Israel but deep within the wounded heart of Germany. In 1948, she fantasizes, the sovereign nation of Judenstaat came into being, carved out of what was formerly Saxony, home to a million Jews who survived the camps, with more streaming in every day. A founding proclamation states the country\u2019s premise: \u201cThe very place we faced our death is where we\u2019ll build our lives.\u201d One of the young nation\u2019s spiritual leaders \u00adraises a new flag sewn from the uniform worn at Auschwitz: blue-and-white prison stripes and, in the center, a yellow star.Is the novel\u2019s placement of the Jewish state in Germany rather than Palestine a poke in the eye of history? Judit conducts a freighted journey through the complexities of this imaginary German-Jewish nation, introducing its highly educated intellectuals and the Orthodox \u201cblack hat\u201d denizens of its sordid underbelly. Throughout, a central question dogs both her and the reader: \u201cWhat happens when you lose everything, but have to go on living? Who do you become?\u201dIn Winters\u2019s novel, Lincoln was assassinated early on, in \u201cthe martyrdom that saved the union\u201d and prevented the Civil War. Instead, the secessionists rejoined the United States with the proviso that what were termed the \u201cHard Four\u201d \u2014 Mississippi, Alabama, the newly combined Carolinas and Louisiana \u2014 could legally preserve the institution of slavery. And so, a century onward, millions now toil at forced labor in behemoth corporate-owned mines and factories in those states.Fleeing this nightmare is just barely possible, thanks to a modern-day human-smuggling enterprise called the Underground Airlines, a piecemeal, ragtag group of saviors, \u201ceach running its own route.\u201d But Victor, the protagonist of Winters\u2019s dystopian novel, renders any flight horrifically dangerous. Himself an escaped slave, he is bound (via a computer chip embedded in his spine) to serve as a bounty hunter for the federal Marshals Service, charged with enforcing the still very extant Fugitive Slave Law, now called the Fugitive Persons Law. So far he has returned more than 200 people to their owners. Skin color, in this disturbingly twisted world, breaks down very specifically in the marshals\u2019 service guide, so that one man\u2019s pigmentation might be listed, for example, as \u201clate-summer honey, warm tone, #76.\u201dThe story pivots on Victor\u2019s ability to locate a specific fugitive named Jackdaw, in flight from the Garments of the Greater South factory. In order to accomplish his unsavory work, Victor must become a shape-shifter. In his Indianapolis hotel room, he stocks picks for cracking locks, a computer with a super-deluxe mapping program, wigs, various clear-glass spectacles, rolls of cash and a gun. Privately, he\u2019s a man of moderate tastes: He adores Michael Jackson\u2019s music, cheap Pakistani cigarettes and his Nissan Altima.An immersive thriller as well as a provocative alternative history, \u201cUnderground Airlines\u201d showcases a fully realized central character who believes his own disturbing past can be kept safely buried. But history has a way of bubbling to the surface of the present.

A spine-tingling moment came when 102-year-old Geraldine \u201cJerry\u201d Emmett, born before women could vote in federal elections, announced Arizona\u2019s votes for Hillary Clinton \u2014 and then cried.So let me try to make the case that when women win, we men win, too.Put aside your feelings about Hillary Clinton: I understand that many Americans distrust her and would welcome a woman in the White House if it were someone else. But whatever one thinks of Clinton, her nomination is a milestone, and a lesson of history is that when women advance, humanity advances.Many of those whose lives were saved were boys. Today, some are still alive, elderly men perhaps disgruntled by the cavalcade of women at the podium in Philadelphia. But they should remember that when women gained power at the voting booth, they used it to benefit boys as well as girls.A result was fewer domestic violence killings in those cities, particularly of men (often men who had battered their wives or girlfriends). Thus the forward-thinking decision to add female police officers ended up saving the lives of backward-thinking men who beat women.Higher education is another area where women have made huge inroads, despite early hostility from men.\u201cWhat is all this nonsense about admitting women to Princeton?\u201d asked one Princeton alumnus in 1968. \u201cA good old-fashioned whorehouse would be considerably more efficient, and much, much cheaper.\u201d A forthcoming book on coeducation, \u201cKeep the Damned Women Out,\u201d by Nancy Weiss Malkiel, notes that the first female undergraduates at Princeton were derided as \u201ccritters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Doubt Proposed Deals by Aetna and Anthem", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwo American health care megadeals have been given grim diagnoses. Aetna\u2019s $34 billion plan to buy rival Humana and Anthem\u2019s $44 billion acquisition of Cigna are risky propositions to shrink the industry to three big insurers from five. Their stock prices now suggest zero chance either deal will succeed. If investors are correct, the companies will return to independence worse than when they started.Fresh fears arose this week that trustbusters have serious concerns about the Aetna deal, following similar competition worries regarding Anthem. The cases against them are relatively simple. When insurers consolidate, the premiums charged tend to rise. Being bigger might help the companies negotiate better deals with hospitals and drug makers, but regulators are often skeptical that the benefits will be passed on to consumers, who would have fewer providers from which to choose. A similar rationale has prevented additional mergers in other industries, including wireless.Both insurance transactions were announced with much fanfare within weeks of each other about a year ago. The gap between the offer prices and where the targets were trading on Friday surpassed 30 percent. Such spreads are indicative of extreme pessimism.Humana shares, for example, are trading 8 percent below where they were in April 2015. That\u2019s when news of several possible insurer deals was reported. Cigna\u2019s are 1 percent cheaper than their undisturbed price. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has increased by about 3 percent over the same period. That means investors assume the two targets are relatively worse off.The potential acquirers have not done any better. Aetna\u2019s stock has returned a bit less than the S.&P. 500, while Anthem\u2019s has been walloped, falling about 14 percent since April 2015. The only real winner has been the UnitedHealth Group, which sat out the deal market and instead concentrated on winning business from its distracted rivals. Its shares have gained 20 percent over this period.It may be that arbitrageurs, who have been burned badly multiple times in recent years, are being overly skittish. Many were caught wrong-footed when Pfizer\u2019s $160 billion effort to buy Allergan fell apart earlier this year, and they took even heavier losses when AbbVie\u2019s $55 billion purchase of Shire blew up in 2014. The insurers could yet stage a miraculous recovery, but the flatlining stocks are usually a telltale sign that it is time to start making other arrangements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock Reports Dip in Quarterly Profit", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byEarnings fell nearly 4 percent, to $789 million, or $4.73 a share, from $819 million, or $4.84 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.Still, even in a fraught investment environment, the company\u2019s assets under management \u2014 its most telling financial indicator \u2014 grew 4 percent, ending the quarter at $4.9 trillion.As has been the case in past quarters, BlackRock\u2019s fast-growing exchange-traded funds drew the largest investments, taking in $15 billion for the quarter.At $1.1 trillion, the company\u2019s iShares E.T.F. brand represents nearly a quarter of BlackRock\u2019s total asset pile and continues to grow at a more rapid clip than its actively managed bond and equity divisions.Like many other asset management firms, BlackRock saw retail and institutional investors pull out their money from actively managed bond and equity funds.Record low interest rates around the world and political uncertainty in Europe over Britain\u2019s future in the European Union have made investing difficult, and many investors have chosen to minimize risk, keeping money in cash and low-yielding bank deposits.Goldman Sachs reported a 78 percent jump in quarterly profit as the Wall Street bank earned more from bond trading and its expenses fell.\u201cPolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, historically low yields and elevated market volatility are leading clients to pause, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits in the U.S., China and Japan alone,\u201d said BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink.But unlike companies that rely solely on their portfolio managers to make stock and bond bets, BlackRock has benefited by having a variety of lower-risk and lower-cost passive strategies, like E.T.F.s, which continue to attract money from investors.The strong showing in equity markets over the last week was the result of investors rushing to put their money back into stocks after many months of withdrawals, Mr. Fink said.Whether or not the bull run is sustainable will depend largely on how corporate earnings fare, he said.Shares of BlackRock were little changed in trading on Thursday.BlackRock\u2019s internal risk management platform, Aladdin, which the company sells to large outside investors like sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, increased its revenue 13 percent for the quarter.Although representing just a small percentage of the company\u2019s overall revenue, Aladdin carries a larger importance for the company as clients with about $10 trillion in assets under management pay BlackRock to use its risk decoding system.For many years now, Mr. Fink has argued that the growing dangers, complexities and regulatory pressures in today\u2019s markets have put a special premium on risk management, which has been the company\u2019s core philosophy since its founding.Asked whether BlackRock executives would celebrate the company reaching $5 trillion in assets under management, which could happen soon if markets keep rallying, Mr. Fink responded swiftly.\u201cWe don\u2019t do attaboys at BlackRock \u2014 so that number tells me nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we continue to drive deeper, more expansive relationships with our clients, we will earn a larger share of wallet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lew, returned to London on Thursday to meet with his British counterpart, after meeting with his predecessor earlier in the week. The last-minute schedule change reflected not just the close American-British relationship, but the global desire to minimize any disruption from the so-called Brexit.The British central bank on Thursday again pointed to potential signs of stress after the referendum. Some businesses were beginning to delay investment projects and postpone recruitment, while consumer sentiment was weakening.Even so, the central bank decided to take a wait-and-see attitude before making another move. The financial system, it noted, looked resilient after the referendum, while banks remained on solid ground in terms of capital.\u201cThe Bank of England has decided that patience is a virtue,\u201d said Paul Diggle, an economist at Aberdeen Asset Management.Mr. Carney has sought to reassure investors, saying the central bank has several tools available to stabilize the market.He made 250 billion pounds, or about $331 billion, available as a backstop to keep the system functioning. The central bank has also lowered the amount of capital that banks are required to keep in reserve, which would in theory allow them to lend more to consumers and businesses.But the central bank, for now, is keeping those two major tools in reserve.The Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the bond purchasing program at the same level, \u00a3375 billion, as it has been for the last four years.\u201cThe committee had taken some reassurance from the evidence that markets had continued to function effectively throughout the period,\u201d the central bank\u2019s minutes said. \u201cThe overall resilience of the U.K. financial system, and the flexibility of the regulatory framework, had allowed the impact of the referendum result to be dampened rather than amplified.\u201dThe next steps will depend on the data.The central bank is expected to unveil in August its updated forecast for inflation, an important metric for monetary policy decisions. It also will keep its eye on the extent to which economic activity has slowed since the referendum \u2014 from housing starts to hiring.One member of the committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, already felt a cut was warranted, pointing in part to the \u201coutlook for medium-term inflation \u2014 even taking into account the boost from the lower level of sterling.\u201d And the committee broadly suggested a rate cut was likely next month.\u201cWhatever the economic merits or demerits of cutting interest rates at this juncture, the lack of clear direction is more likely to add to economic uncertainty and therefore be detrimental to demand and the economy,\u201d said Angus Armstrong, the director of macroeconomics at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Equity Funds Balk at Disclosure, and Public Risk Grows", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byFair GameOne of the bills proposed in California would have required only modest disclosures: the publication of a handful of pages from confidential limited partnership agreements. It was shot down.\u201cThe net effect is that a California public fund would receive much less than a full picture of the related-party transactions,\u201d said Michael Flaherman, a former board member of the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and chairman of its investment committee, who is now a visiting scholar at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe missing part of the picture would be the portion of the fees that the private equity firms get to pocket in full.\u201dThe research also identified another crucial shift: Past returns by a private equity manager are no longer as reliable a predictor of that manager\u2019s future performance.The report \u201cAre Lower Private Equity Returns the New Normal?\u201d was written by Eileen Appelbaum, a senior economist at the center, and Rosemary Batt, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. It examines the most recent academic research on private equity returns during both boom times and busts.For years, private equity funds beat the overall stock market by a fairly wide margin. Since 2006, however, this has not been the case.One 2015 academic study cited in the report found that during the 1990s the median private equity fund exceeded the returns of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index by 1.75 percent annually. Since 2006, however, the median fund has basically been in line with the performance of the S.&P.Another study highlighted in the report drew the same conclusion. It calculated returns as of 2014 for funds of different vintages and compared their performance with that of earlier funds. This study considered funds with start dates ranging from the 1990s to 2009.The findings? While the median private equity fund from the 1990s outperformed the S.&P. 500 by a cumulative 19 percent over its life span, excess returns fell to just 3 percent by 2006. Funds set up between 2007 and 2009 underperformed the overall stock market by a bit.\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a while that private equity has not yielded returns that beat the stock market by a sufficient amount that compensates the investors for the risks involved,\u201d Ms. Appelbaum said in an interview. \u201cWhat was very surprising was to find that they just matched the stock market. You pay all this money and you get exactly what you could have gotten by investing in an index fund.\u201dMs. Appelbaum said she was also surprised to learn that among many fund managers, past performance was no longer prologue.Before 2000, high-performing managers typically did well in different funds they offered later. But no longer.\u201cThe probability that a high-performing fund manager in the subsequent fund will do well is about one-quarter,\u201d Ms. Appelbaum said.The research also shows private equity funds to be cyclical investments, not the year-in, year-out performers they\u2019re often marketed as.If private equity funds can\u2019t consistently beat the overall market it means trouble for the underfunded pension plans that have loaded up on these high-cost investments. Roughly one-third of the money in private equity funds comes from public pensions. These funds rely on private equity to generate the outsize gains they need to meet their obligations to retirees.The stock prices of some of the largest private equity firms suggest they should be worried. Shares of the Blackstone Group, the Fortress Investment Group and KKR & Company are down significantly year to date; investors are clearly discounting these firms\u2019 future earnings, which is powered by their funds\u2019 performance fees.\u201cIf you look at the investors \u2014 pension funds, foundations, universities \u2014 the thing that is so surprising to me is they are very happy to put money back into private equity,\u201d Ms. Appelbaum said. \u201cAnd they are doing so at a time when the funds themselves will tell you, \u2018We really can\u2019t find any place to put this money.\u2019 How is this going to pay off in the end?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Quiet Comeback of Reverse Mortgages", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byRetiringWHEN Peter and Joyce Hill wanted to buy a home in a community for people 55 and older in an area they had always admired in Lancaster County, Pa., they used a reverse mortgage to finance building in that development.\u201cA reverse mortgage gave us the option to build what we wanted,\u201d said Peter Hill, 79, who retired two years ago from a career in telecom engineering. \u201cThat appealed to us.\u201dReverse mortgages \u2014 which let homeowners 62 and older tap their accumulated home equity without facing monthly payments in return \u2014 earned a bad reputation over the years when they were subject to widespread abuses by lenders.The volume of these mortgages dropped to around 30,000 this year from about 115,000 at their peak popularity in 2009, according to the Federal Housing Administration. But with reforms in the system, they are making a modest comeback, seen as a way of helping some retirees fill gaps in their future income.Like a conventional mortgage, a reverse mortgage obligation is satisfied when the house is sold by the owners, the last owner has died or the home is sold by heirs. Any equity left over is kept by the last homeowner.Since these loans, also known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, are insured by the government, the Federal Housing Administration will cover any shortfalls between the final loan balance and net proceeds from the sale. That means you don\u2019t have to worry about being \u201cunderwater\u201d on the loan in case the home\u2019s value is less than the mortgaged amount.\u201cThey\u2019ve always been there as a last resort,\u201d said John Salter, a financial planning professor at Texas Tech. \u201cBut they make a lot more sense now because home equity can be a big part of net worth.\u201dAlthough still little used, reverse mortgages can allow retirees with only modest savings but little or no housing debt to stay in their homes, while also providing a financial backstop for those concerned about outliving their retirement funds.Ms. Hill noted that their reverse mortgage, which they took out on the new home they were building, took away the burden of conventional housing debt, the monthly payments of interest and principal, and assured their heirs that they would never have to make up any losses if the home sold for less than the value of its mortgage. \u201cThat gives us freedom of mind,\u201d she said.Reverse mortgages got off to a bad start when they were introduced more than 20 years ago, but they have redeemed themselves in recent years, supporters say, under tighter regulation from the F.H.A. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Jamie Hopkins, a professor at the American College of Financial Services, said a combination of lower costs and better consumer protections \u2014 counseling is now required before lending \u2014 helped encourage some financial planners to start recommending them.Mr. Hopkins has found \u201cthat many people don\u2019t have enough money to get through retirement, so they have to consider using all of their wealth, including home equity as a retirement income source.\u201d\u201cPeople have peaks and troughs in demands for cash,\u201d said Peter Bell, president of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, an industry trade group. \u201cWhen they have peak demand, they may make poor decisions and cash in investments.\u201dAnother reason older people may turn to a reverse mortgage is to finance the costs of long-term care.Although a source of ready cash, reverse mortgages aren\u2019t right for everyone. If you want to provide a bequest to your heirs by allowing them to sell your home upon your death, a reverse mortgage can wipe out much of the equity in your home.\u201cReverse mortgages are off the table if you want to leave your home to your kids,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said.These loans are also challenging for those who have to move because of a disability, are selling a home after a short period or are relocating.When considering a reverse mortgage, take your time and do the math. How long do you plan to stay in the home? How much will you qualify for based on your age and home value? How will the cash be used? Will you need the cash right away? Would you prefer a line of credit that you can use at a later date?In addition to understanding how reverse mortgages would fit into your financial plan, you will need to shop around. Like other mortgages, they have closing costs, which range from $4,000 to $15,000, though those amounts typically are not paid upfront because they can be added to the loan\u2019s principal. Rates can be either variable or fixed.Keep in mind that even if you don\u2019t understand the terms of these loans at first, you will be required to speak with a trained counselor before you sign up for one. And there are plenty of rules you\u2019ll need to know. For example, the loans are not available for rental properties; they are available only for owner-occupied principal residences.You need to know all the features of these loans before approaching a broker or bank. Although they could appear to be ready, secure sources of cash during your most vulnerable years, they are still complex vehicles that ideally should be used only as part of a sound overall retirement plan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "C.E.O.s Meet in Secret Over the Sorry State of Public Companies", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byWarren E. Buffett quietly walked through the lobby of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters on Park Avenue in Manhattan last summer and was ushered up to the 49th floor by a security guard, trying to avoid drawing too much attention. Laurence D. Fink, chairman of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager \u2014 with more than $4 trillion \u2014 soon was also escorted upstairs. Abby Johnson, the chief executive of Fidelity (which invests more than $2 trillion), and Frederick William McNabb III, chief of Vanguard ($3 trillion), were also shepherded to the elevator.In all, the parade included about a dozen chief executives of investment firms \u2014 T. Rowe Price, State Street \u2014 plus the head of a public pension fund and an activist investor. All had arrived for a meeting that they were told they would absolutely have to keep secret.When they reached the 49th floor, they were met by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon.The agenda \u2014 shaped over many conversations Mr. Dimon had had with his friend, Mr. Buffett \u2014 was to discuss the sorry state of publicly traded companies: too little trust and connection between shareholders and management, too many rules imposed by so-called governance experts and too many idiosyncratic accounting guidelines. As a result, much of the smart money in the United States is going \u2014 and staying \u2014 private, creating more companies that have less public accountability and transparency.Over a series of meetings, conference calls and email exchanges that later included the chiefs of General Motors, General Electric and Verizon, among others, the group discussed a series of corporate governance \u201cprinciples\u201d that the participants could all agree on: Topics included compensation for chief executives and board members (more payment in stock, less cash) and earnings guidance (the group is generally not a fan). Along the way, at least two major investors, Fidelity and Wellington Management, dropped out, refusing to sign the list of \u201cprinciples.\u201dOn Thursday, the group will release the culmination of its work in an open letter and detailed report that includes its list of principles \u2014 which are intended to stir a conversation within the business community.The report includes some recommendations that will seem ordinary; they suggest that the boards of public companies should be diverse. But other suggestions, including one that seems to say many public companies should not offer earnings guidance, may be more surprising.Another principle takes on companies that use accounting methods that exclude stock-based compensation from non-GAAP earnings. The group asserts that stock-based compensation is \u201cplainly a cost of doing business.\u201dThe group generally disapproved of companies with dual-class voting, in which people with a privileged category of shares get more say than the average investor. (Examples of companies set up this way include Facebook and The New York Times.) The group said, \u201cIf a company has dual-class voting, which sometimes is intended to protect the company from short-term behavior, the company should consider having specific sunset provisions based upon time or a triggering event, which eliminate dual-class voting.\u201dThe report also includes a recommendation that may upset chief executives who like to keep a firm grasp on the chain of command and distance between management and the board: The group says that the board of a public company should be able to meet with any employees outside of the presence of the chief executive to get an unvarnished view of the way the company is being run.The group also decided that if a company did not have two people acting as chairman and chief executive to act as a check on each other, a strong lead director should be chosen.The principles are considered suggestions, not requirements. \u201cThese recommendations are not meant to be absolute,\u201d the group wrote. (While various members of the group were willing to be interviewed about the project, they all did so on condition of anonymity.)The idea for starting the series of meetings grew out of a frustration Mr. Dimon had about public companies. Talented executives have left public companies in droves to work at private companies \u2014 outside the harsh spotlight of the stock market, activist investors and new regulations. Many Silicon Valley companies have sought to delay public offerings for as long as possible.Publicly listed companies in the United States have become something of a dying breed. In 1996, there were 8,025 public listed companies in the United States; by 2012, the number of companies was about half: 4,101, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.Mr. Dimon had been on the phone with Mr. Buffett lamenting what he described as the broken system for public companies and corporate governance when he asked him if he would help convene a group of the nation\u2019s largest companies and investors to see if they could fix the problem.One of questions posed to the group: \u201cIf you inherited the company you now run and had to hire someone else to manage it, how would you set up its governance?\u201d It was a blue-sky question and the answers were very different from what many governance experts expect of public companies today.During the meetings, according to several who participated but said they agreed not to speak publicly, some members of the group said that rather than maintaining a board of a dozen or more people, as most public companies do, they\u2019d have only a handful of board members, all of them experts in the business: fewer academics and consultants, more industry professionals.Many in the group said they wished they could persuade shareholders not to push for \u2014 and boards not to enact \u2014 requirements that that board members retire by a certain age; if Mr. Buffett were on your board, why wouldn\u2019t you want him to stay?And many agreed that the board members should be compensated in large part in stock instead of cash; one of the group\u2019s published principles is that board members should be receive at least half of their compensation in stock.Despite the moratorium on speaking publicly, news about the emergence of the group did leak earlier this year in The Financial Times \u2014 to the consternation of several participants.While the \u201cprinciples\u201d are only recommendations, Fidelity ended up pulling out of the consortium, as did Wellington, in part, because many of their funds have their own fiduciary requirements. \u201cEvery company has its own distinct business model, culture and values, and thus, we generally do not sign on to blanket industry documents,\u201d Fidelity said while praising the conversation as valuable.An article last Thursday about a secret meeting of corporate leaders to discuss the sorry state of publicly traded companies described incorrectly mandatory retirement ages that apply to some corporate boards. The requirements are established by corporations, not by the New York Stock Exchange.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should I Have Talked to My Father About His Cross-Dressing?", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistMy father died seven years ago. He was 93. When I was getting divorced in the late \u201980s and sharing my sexual woes with my mother, she confessed to me that my father dressed up in women\u2019s clothes, and that she never could deal with it. She wished she had gone to therapy years earlier when she first discovered it. She made me promise never to talk about it. I later found out that both my sisters knew about this as well.As my father aged, it seemed as if he might not care if the subject was brought up: He left a makeup tray out in his bathroom, as well as nylons hanging to dry. I knew from my mother that he would get dressed up and go to the drive-through at the bank and other places. But I kept my promise. My father was always tight-lipped when it came to emotions and carried around a lot of baggage from his childhood. His mother died shortly after he was born, and his step\u00admothers supposedly were never very nice to him.Since he died, I regret never having discussed this aspect of his life with him. I wonder what it would be like for him to see specials on Caitlyn Jenner, for example. I don\u2019t really know if my father was queer, just a cross-dresser or what, but being a freewheeling bisexual myself, I hold no judgment, and I feel that if I had brought the subject up with him, our relationship might have been a closer one. Or maybe he would have clammed up more; I will never know. But my suspicion \u2014 speaking not as an ethicist but as an amateur shrink \u2014 is that talking with your father about his cross-dressing wouldn\u2019t have brought you much closer. The disinhibitions of age aside, your father doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of person who would have wanted to discuss intimate matters with his children. When your mother made the disclosure, there was less understanding of the complexities of gender expression and identity, and so less of a context within which to discuss it. But even today, we rightly think that people should be able to decide what they want others to know about their gender identity.Given that his actions were professionally and personally irresponsible, he\u2019s not owed much consideration by any of you. Once you\u2019ve told him that you disapprove of what he has done, you should feel free to spread the news widely through the family. You certainly want to protect your sister-in-law and her mother from exposure to the same risks. In talking to your sister-in-law, you won\u2019t be the one responsible for any breach in the bonds of family: That began with her husband\u2019s appalling conduct.Over the weekend, my friends and I were at a party, and one of them (who had been drinking) confided that she periodically makes herself throw up, and that she has been doing this since she was a young teenager. When she told me, I was surprised, and asked if I should be worried. She said no, that all of her friends knew about it, and that it was fine. That said, I am concerned about her physical and mental health.The next day, I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so I acted as if nothing had happened. She said she didn\u2019t remember a lot of things from that night; I\u2019m not sure if she recalls telling me about her situation. I\u2019ve also noticed that her attitudes about food, dieting and exercise seem misguided and compulsive, and that she needs a lot of validation about her appearance. I didn\u2019t think these things were a big deal, but now I\u2019m afraid they might be signs of something more serious.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Why Is the Stock Market So High? Ask the Bond Market", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe American stock market has reached new highs this summer for some unsettling reasons.This time, though, many of the factors that typically propel a rising market are absent: Corporate earnings aren\u2019t strong, the economy isn\u2019t booming, and stock prices aren\u2019t cheap.None of those fundamental indicators have been auspicious, but it hasn\u2019t mattered because the fuel that is making the stock market soar seems to be coming from outside the stock market entirely.In fact, it appears that we need to thank the bond and foreign exchange markets for providing the underpinnings for the stock rally.Bonds have risen sharply in value, and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. That has made stock prices look cheap and dividends generous. The average dividend for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is about 2.1 percent \u2014 much higher than the yield on a 10-year Treasury note. Many investors have moved to stocks in search of a better deal.That has helped make stocks rise, even though stock valuations aren\u2019t particularly appealing after seven years of price increases.That\u2019s part of the story. But there\u2019s more. Not all parts of the stock market are being affected in the same way. Another factor, the strong dollar, has made stock sectors that are fairly impervious to exchange-rate shifts especially attractive. When foreign earnings in, say, euros or pounds translate into fewer dollars, American stocks with predominantly domestic revenue streams usually benefit.That\u2019s why many American utility and phone company stocks \u2014 which both pay high dividends \u2014 have been soaring.\u201cThese stocks have hit a sweet spot,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, who focuses on telecom companies, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. As a group, telecom companies have far outpaced the market as a whole, even though Mr. Moffett is skeptical about the prospects for the sector\u2019s stocks. Many of them are overvalued, he says.\u201cAs an analyst, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter what the specific issues are for these companies as businesses. Their stocks at the moment are trading for other reasons: interest rates and the dollar.\u201d He has found a strong correlation between these factors and telecom stocks.\u201cAt the moment,\u201d he said, \u201cinterest rates and exchange rates outweigh the stock fundamentals.\u201dStock investors, therefore, may want to seek guidance from these markets, especially the bond market, which has moved into historically unusual territory.The 10-year Treasury note, for example, has had an average yield of more than 6 percent since 1965 but has fallen to less than 1.5 percent today, and that counts as a solid yield in the current global market. More than $13 trillion in government bonds around the world carry negative yields, a concept that is difficult to grasp. Buy a bond and you will lose money \u2014 unless yields drop even further into the negative zone, driving up bond prices.Market prices suggest that a rate increase won\u2019t occur before December, especially with a presidential election looming in November. But other central banks have been moving toward even more expansive monetary policies, adding luster to the dollar and hurting returns of American companies with major overseas revenue streams.Given those realities, investors hungry for better returns and higher yields have been flocking to the American stock market, especially to high-dividend-paying, low-foreign-revenue utility and telecom stocks. Both sectors have risen more than 20 percent this year.The current interest rate and exchange rate alignment may well persist for a good while, but there are no guarantees. A recession, a surge in inflation, an unexpected rise in interest rates or a major political shock or natural disaster could wreak immediate damage. And interest rates and inflation have rarely remained at today\u2019s low levels for very long.Mr. Rosenberg therefore suggests that investors begin to hedge against these risks by diversifying with inflation-indexed bonds, gold and some reasonably priced stocks in sectors like railroads, automobiles, banking and construction.Mr. Moffett is certain that at some point, the usefulness of his kind of detailed stock analysis will be restored.\u201cMany of the valuations in the market don\u2019t make sense right now in isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk for investors is that if interest rates start to rise, stock prices could start to shift almost overnight. That may not happen soon, but eventually it will happen. And for a lot of people, that won\u2019t be a very pleasant moment.\u201dTwitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buy It With Cash, Mortgage It Later", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byAnthony Corbisiero wanted a quick sale on his studio pied-\u00e0-terre in West Chelsea, as he planned to use a portion of the proceeds for his daughter\u2019s looming college expenses.So he and his wife, Julie, who live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, were thrilled when three bids emerged within a week. Two were all cash. \u201cThe other buyer preferred to do it with financing,\u201d said Mr. Corbisiero, an independent stock trader. \u201cBut why should I wait for them to get a mortgage?\u201dIn any competitive market, all-cash offers typically win out. In neighborhoods and at price points where inventory is tight and bidding wars almost a certainty, the financing-free strategy at the bargaining table has become more commonplace \u2014 and more or less imperative, some real estate brokers say. A key advantage is that these deals are done more quickly than financed transactions, which appeals to sellers like the Corbisieros. There is no lender red tape to slow down the process, like appraisal requirements and concerns about whether those appraisals will come in high enough and whether buyers can borrow as much as they need.One solution for the reluctant cash buyer is to delay financing: Buy using all cash, but borrow soon after. Delayed financing can help buyers stay competitive in hot housing markets, and even negotiate a better deal, without tying up their assets for too long.In order to participate in the Fannie Mae program, borrowers must show, among other things, that there are no liens against the home and must document the sources of the cash for the purchase. They must also prove that the sale was at \u201carm\u2019s length,\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t buy the property from a relative or close business associate. Borrowers, however, are limited in how much they can cash out, depending on whether the property is a primary or second home. A maximum of 70 percent of its appraised value is allowed, according to Fannie Mae, up to local conforming loan standards \u2014 in Manhattan, that means a $625,500 loan amount on a single-family home.For larger purchases, in which the maximum-percent cash out would exceed the amount in the conforming loan standards \u2014 often the case in pricier markets like New York City \u2014 cash buyers can opt for delayed financing through non-agency \u201cjumbo\u201d loans that are not subject to borrowing limits and the strict conventional rules.The percentage of Manhattan homes bought with cash in the first half of 2016.\u201cSomeone puts in an all-cash offer and takes their liquid assets to buy the property for all cash, and then gets preapproval for a loan,\u201d said Bradley Wayman, the mortgage sales director at Citibank in Manhattan. \u201cIn many cases, they\u2019ll have a loan in process and close with all cash.\u201dMr. Milner said that these types of delayed financing transactions account for around 2 percent of his business, while Mr. Wayman said, \u201cOn average, our top loan lenders do one deal per month.\u201d And most of those deals, he said, involve homes priced below $4 million.Unlike the situation at the very high end of the market, \u201cwhen you go down the ladder, it becomes more competitive in terms of offerings \u2014 there are a lot less of them,\u201d said Michael Graves, a broker at Douglas Elliman, referring to homes for sale. For that reason, he advises the sellers he represents not to accept offers contingent on the buyer obtaining a mortgage. \u201cIn the last six years, there has been only one deal where we accepted a finance contingency. It\u2019s not up to us where the cash comes from, but it must be cash.\u201dHe continued: \u201cSome are borrowing from their 401(k)\u2019s; others are liquidating investments. Some are asking family members to help close. Many of them are selling another property. I\u2019ve seen pretty much everything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy: You walk in and see the place for 10 minutes, and then you have to make a decision on it,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. \u201cBut after looking at so many properties for a year, you just know.\u201dHe added that \u201cthe only way to go was all cash at the asking price.\u201dMr. McDonald came up with the $3 million for the purchase after liquidating several investments, then three months later, took out a $1.95 million jumbo loan \u2014 a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage at 2.5 percent with Wells Fargo, he said \u2014 that enabled him to replenish much of his investment portfolio.His agent, Crystal Zahedi of Douglas Elliman, who also represented Mr. Corbisiero, said, \u201cWhen you get a well-priced apartment in this market, you do have to use that strategy \u2014 or, at the very least, have a deal not contingent on financing. That\u2019s the first step.\u201dWhile it\u2019s fairly common for buyers to forego a financing contingency these days, the all-cash, delayed-financing strategy has been slow to catch on, partly because many home buyers simply aren\u2019t aware of the option. (And in some co-op buildings, it also may not be feasible, because residents are required to have a certain amount of liquidity available after a purchase.)\u201cThis turned out to be a good move,\u201d Ms. Thomas-Senior said, \u201cbecause the property has since appreciated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their task is to nominate the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the election in November. There is a single contender: Donald J.

{"Headline": "From Fallen Presidential Candidates, Bold Money Ideas Worth Another Look", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyWelcome to the season of the big, political personal finance promises.We\u2019ll be hearing plenty more proposals like this at the conventions in the next few weeks. But as always in politics, the bigger the possible benefit or cut, the higher the price and the lower the odds that anything like it will ever come to pass.So let us turn instead to bold money ideas from the presidential candidates who did not get this far. The three proposals below, which involve student loans, credit histories and retirement savings, are notable for the measurable improvement they would offer and that they need not cost taxpayers much at all.They deserve another hearing, including by the surviving candidates.Some big ideas do come to pass. Obamacare did, after all. So let\u2019s assume for the moment that Mrs. Clinton gets elected and her college proposal becomes reality. There will still be students from families with incomes above $125,000 who may need to borrow. Others will need money for room and board, graduate school or private colleges (where tuition will not be free under the Clinton plan).And if she drops her plan (which was inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s more generous one), cannot get it through Congress or loses the election? All the more reason to consider Jeb Bush\u2019s proposal for a radical overhaul of the federal student loan program.Borrowers would pay through payroll deduction or quarterly payments, just as they now pay estimated taxes. This would reduce the (too large) number of people who are behind or in default, often because they are not aware of the confusing array of income-driven repayment programs that already exist.The big catch here is a proposed $50,000 borrowing cap. That\u2019s more than most undergraduates can currently borrow from the federal student loan program but much less than most graduate students can borrow. Many of the people who need more than that for advanced degrees, however, will probably be well served by lenders in the private sector. Teenage undergraduates with nonexistent credit histories might not be so lucky, according to Jason Delisle, who was an informal adviser to the Bush campaign. Hence the desire to do more for them.The law does currently require mortgage lenders to give all applicants the credit score that they are using. Moreover, any company that turns down customers because of their credit score or forces them to pay more than they might have otherwise is supposed to hand over the score it used.So given that these companies have the scores available or can easily gain access to them, perhaps the next president could try to require that every company hand out the ones they are using to any consumer who asks. People who ask for one but do not end up becoming a customer within a reasonable period of time could be required to pay a nominal fee to cover the company\u2019s costs.Mr. Birdthistle, who worked for a big law firm that defended troubled mutual fund companies before he became a professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology\u2019s Chicago-Kent College of Law, points to the political pickle a candidate might be in for supporting the Thrift Savings Plan. Voters might blame a Democrat for not pounding the table hard enough for more guaranteed income from Social Security. A Republican, however, would be praising a giant government savings plan that offers better investments and lower prices than most of the private sector delivers.Wall Street would not be thrilled, and perhaps donors who work there made their feelings known to Senator Rubio after he spoke up in 2014.Opening the Thrift Savings Plan to everyone would have a cost, given the complexity of payroll withholding from untold numbers of new workers. Mr. Birdthistle suggested that the government might build a parallel program alongside the current plan so as not to impose those new costs on incumbent participants.Or you could do what a partner at Mr. Birdthistle\u2019s former firm told him and his fellow associates to do with their money. After getting them up to speed on their mutual fund clients and the various accusations of scandals and schemes they faced, he recommended a different investment firm, one that is best known for its index funds. That company is owned by its funds, which are owned by the shareholders.The solution, the partner told them, was simple. \u201cJust put your money in Vanguard,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this column misstated a calculation in Jeb Bush\u2019s student loan proposal.

And because money still makes the world go \u2019round, attention must be paid to what the markets are trying to tell us.Some commentators blame the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, accusing them of engineering \u201cartificially low\u201d interest rates that encourage speculation and distort the economy. These are, by the way, largely the same people who used to predict that budget deficits would cause interest rates to soar. In any case, however, it\u2019s important to understand that they\u2019re not making sense.For what does \u201cartificially low\u201d mean in this context? Compared to what? Historically, the consequence of excessively easy money \u2014 the way you know that money is too easy \u2014 has been out-of-control inflation. That\u2019s not happening in America, where inflation is still below the Fed\u2019s target, and it\u2019s definitely not happening in Europe, where the central bank has been trying to raise inflation, without success.If anything, developments in the real economies of the advanced world are telling us that interest rates aren\u2019t low enough \u2014 that is, while low rates may be having their usual effects of boosting the housing sector and, to some extent, the stock market, those effects aren\u2019t big enough to produce a strong recovery. But why?So what\u2019s going on? I think of it as the Great Capitulation.Many people don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening, but raising rates in the face of weak economies would be an act of folly that might well push us back into recession.I know, deficit scolds would issue dire warnings about the evils of public debt. But they have been wrong about everything for at least the past eight years, and it\u2019s time to stop taking them seriously.They say that money talks; well, cheap money is speaking very clearly right now, and it\u2019s telling us to invest in our future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Already Shaky, U.S. Profits Shudder After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byTo the growing list of problems brought about by June\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, you can add corporate profits in the United States.The pace of earnings growth for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has been declining since the third quarter of 2014, and it officially turned negative a year ago. Because stock prices tend to follow the general path of profits, this helps to explain why the broad stock market may have been generally flat over the last two years.But many market strategists had been predicting an end to the earnings drought in the second half of 2016 because of rebounding oil and commodity prices \u2014 a sign the global economy was finding its footing. That is, until Britain chose to leave the European Union in a surprising vote last month, raising a whole new set of risks.\u201cIf companies were looking for a built-in excuse for an earnings disappointment, they\u2019ve found it,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.By raising concerns over the British and European economies, the Brexit vote has spooked investors who had parked their cash in the pound and euro, leading to a stronger dollar, Mr. Ablin said. And that hurts the fortunes of American companies that generate a sizable portion of their revenue abroad.Before Brexit, the dollar had fallen slightly against a basket of foreign currencies this year, after gaining more than 20 percent in 2014 and 2015. A weakening dollar not only reduces the cost of goods made in the United States and sold in foreign markets, it also increases international profits for American firms when they convert their overseas earnings back into dollars.Since the Brexit vote on June 23, though, the dollar has risen in strength.This trend shouldn\u2019t have an impact on second-quarter profits, because the British vote took place at the very end of that period. Wall Street analysts continue to look for a profit decline of about 5.5 percent versus the same period a year earlier.That would actually represent an improvement from the 6.8 percent decline in the first quarter and would end a streak of seven consecutive quarters of declining growth rates.\u201cOur call for U.S. corporate profits to bounce back in the second quarter is still valid,\u201d said Olga Bitel, an economist and portfolio manager at the asset manager William Blair.\u201cLooking forward, however, there\u2019s a considerable amount of ambiguity,\u201d she said.Market strategists had been expecting profit growth for the S.&P. 500 to turn positive in the third quarter, followed by a rise in earnings of nearly 8 percent in the fourth, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence. Such a bounce would have bolstered the argument of the optimists on Wall Street, who believe the seven-year-old bull market can keep running despite being older than average.Such lofty profit projections aren\u2019t easy to make now.\u201cI have a difficult time thinking how large-cap profit growth will rebound significantly this year,\u201d said Mr. Ablin at BMO.Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at Westwood Holdings Group, said that in addition to a potentially stronger dollar, \u201cBrexit calls into question projections for global growth, and that\u2019s an additional headwind for the markets,\u201d he said.So are rising wages.Throughout this long but shallow economic recovery, wage growth had been weighed down by several factors, including cost-cutting efforts and lackluster productivity growth.But wage growth has finally started to pick up. \u201cFor the last 12 months, wages have grown about 2.5 percent, inflation has been at 1 percent, and productivity growth has been zero,\u201d said Ben Inker, co-head of the asset allocation team at the asset management firm GMO. \u201cThat\u2019s a 1.5 percent increase in unit labor costs. That\u2019s the reverse of what\u2019s been happening on profits.\u201dMr. Inker argues that in the long run, this could be a positive for the broad economy. \u201cYou could view this as a healing process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a long time when wages grew so much less than productivity. But if labor income is improving, that\u2019s more money going into the household sector, and households will probably spend it.\u201dIn the short run, however, rising wages will put pressure on near-term corporate profits.Investors should not overreact, said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial.Mr. White noted that so far, the profit drought has been concentrated in just a handful of the 10 sectors of the market. For instance, in the second quarter, energy sector profits are expected to be down 82 percent. And profits for basic materials companies, which are tied to commodities, and financial stocks are forecast to drop 7 and 9 percent.Yet other sectors of the market haven\u2019t been affected nearly as much. \u201cWe continue to see decent earnings growth in areas such as the consumer discretionary sector,\u201d he said. Companies that deliver goods and services that aren\u2019t necessities but that households want \u2014 appliances, cars and entertainment \u2014 are expected to see a 9 percent increase in their profits in the second quarter and a 13 percent rise in 2016.John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, also likes consumer discretionary stocks, including automakers, in addition to industrial companies that are benefiting from low commodity prices.An added benefit is that companies in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors tend to have modest exposure to foreign economies. Only 26 percent of the revenue for consumer discretionary companies and 38 percent of sales for industrial firms in the S.&P. 500 are generated abroad, according to FactSet. By contrast, nearly 60 percent of information technology company sales are foreign.Why is this important? Because domestically oriented companies have been sheltered from many of the negative effects of the strong dollar.FactSet, for instance, points out that while profits for companies that generate most of their sales abroad are expected to fall 9.9 percent in the second quarter, domestically focused firms are bracing for a more modest 2.8 percent decline.Besides sticking with domestically oriented businesses, investors should also focus on industry leaders, whose dominant positions in their industries are likely to produce steadier earnings growth.\u201cWe think the benefit of being with the dominant, No. 1 player has increased over time in this economy,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer at Osterweis Capital Management.Even in the energy sector, where earnings growth is hard to come by, Mr. Osterweis said he has been adding to his position in industry leaders like Halliburton.\u201cIf oil prices recover, the dominant player wins,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if oil prices were to stay low for longer, more and more of Halliburton\u2019s competitors might go out of business, so it would gain market share.\u201dHe adds: \u201cPeople often get spooked and discouraged when the market is under pressure. But that can give you an opportunity to swoop in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stress Tests Find Some Big European Banks Wanting", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 European regulators announced on Friday that new stress tests found that a handful of the region\u2019s biggest banks would struggle in a severe economic downturn or in the next financial crisis.Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s oldest bank, was the worst performer in this year\u2019s stress tests, as an important measure of its capital fell to a negative in a crisis situation modeled by the European Banking Authority, which regulates lenders in the European Union.Just before the results were announced, Monte dei Paschi said that it would raise 5 billion euros, or about $5.5 billion, in new capital and shed more than \u20ac9 billion in nonperforming loans.Allied Irish Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland were among the other banks with so-called Tier 1 capital ratios that declined sharply in the tests. And among the region\u2019s larger banks, the Tier 1 capital ratios of the Italian lender UniCredit, Barclays of Britain and Deutsche Bank of Germany would all fall below 8 percent in the hypothetical crisis.The tests, by the European Banking Authority, were conducted at a pivotal time for the region\u2019s lenders.Financial markets, and bank stocks in particular, have been rattled at times in recent weeks by the uncertainty stemming from Britain\u2019s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union.The European Union said on Friday that the growth in the economy in the eurozone slowed in the second quarter, an unwelcome sign for banks that are already grappling with a decline in trading revenue.Concern is growing about the ability of Italy\u2019s banks to deal with hundreds of billions of euros in problem loans.And one of Europe\u2019s largest banks, Deutsche Bank, has been under pressure from investors as its chief executive, John Cryan, tries to turn it around.The latest tests examined the balance sheets of 51 European banks, representing about 70 percent of the region\u2019s banking industry.Unlike tests in previous years, this round did not have a minimum capital threshold that lenders had to meet to pass. As a result, no bank could actually fail, or pass, the examination. But the higher the capital ratio, the stronger the bank.Local banking supervisors like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will use the results to determine whether banks need to take additional action, such as raising capital.\u201cWhile we recognize the extensive capital-raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health,\u201d said Andrea Enria, the chairman of the European Banking Authority. \u201cThere remains work to do, which supervisors will undertake.\u201dUnder this year\u2019s examination, bank balance sheets were tested against the impact of a macroeconomic downturn over three years, in which real gross domestic product would decline by 1.2 percent in the European Union in 2016, fall by a further 1.3 percent in 2017 and recover slightly in 2018.The banks examined this year had an average capital ratio of 13.2 percent as of the end of December 2015.The ratio declined to 9.4 percent by 2018, the third year of the hypothetical crisis.By comparison, European banks in the European Banking Authority\u2019s last stress test two years ago had a Tier 1 ratio of 11.1 percent at the end of 2013.The biggest impact came from credit losses; banks across the region suffered cumulative losses of \u20ac349 billion. The results also forecast market risk losses of \u20ac148 billion and a cumulative loss of \u20ac105 billion from so-called conduct risk.The examination also found that the average return on regulatory capital for banks in the test sample was 6.5 percent at the end of 2015, which is below the cost of equity and return on equity that banks consider sustainable long term, the regulator said.In 2014, the regulator examined the balance sheets of 123 of the region\u2019s lenders, identifying 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and that would need additional buffers to be prepared for an economic downturn.This year\u2019s tests involved a much smaller number of lenders, though the regulator said it covered 70 percent of the banking sector in Europe.No banks from Greece or Portugal were included, and many of Italy\u2019s smaller lenders were spared.The stocks of Monte dei Paschi and other Italian banks have been under pressure in recent months over concerns about the sheer size of nonperforming loans on their books, some \u20ac360 billion.According to the Bank of Italy, about \u20ac210 billion of those loans are held by insolvent borrowers, and an additional \u20ac150 billion are loans that are considered unlikely to be repaid, past due or in breach of an overdraft ceiling. Some of those loans could ultimately be repaid.After write-downs, the amount of bad loans falls to \u20ac87 billion. Some \u20ac50 billion of those are backed by assets with a value estimated at \u20ac85 billion, the central bank said.New European rules, adopted after the financial crisis, have made it harder for the government to step in and devise a solution.Those rules require bondholders to shoulder much of the losses before a government-backed bailout can be put in place, a process known as a bail-in. That could have a major impact on the confidence of investors in Italy, as many small investors there hold bank bonds.This year, Italy\u2019s government helped orchestrate the creation of Atlante, a private fund intended to help shore up the capital in Italy\u2019s banks and buy nonperforming loans.Advertisement"}

Peter Marino, who designed the Getty as well as the museum\u2019s 6,400-square-foot interior, has done seven residences for Mr. Hill and his wife, Janine, the director of fellowship affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations.The couple collect together (although he is the more obsessive of the two) and now have established the Hill Art Foundation, for which the gallery will be named.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much art in storage,\u201d Mr. Hill, 68, the billionaire vice chairman at the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, said in an interview at their Upper East Side apartment.Spending time with Mr. Hill offers a window into the thinking of a major player in the art world: how he approaches collecting and why he\u2019s now decided to share some of his extensive holdings regularly with the public.The gallery will draw mostly from the Hill collection, valued at more than $800 million, which includes prime examples of Modern and contemporary art, as well as old masters. It may also borrow works from collections \u201cwhere I have a relationship,\u201d Mr. Hill said.The Hills\u2019 apartment \u2014 like their homes in East Hampton, Paris and Telluride, Colo. \u2014 is something of a museum itself.It\u2019s hard to take it all in: Lucio Fontana\u2019s glazed terra cotta crucifix from the 1950s; Alessandro Algardi\u2019s 17th-century bronze \u201cCorpus Christi.\u201d Mr. Hill casually passes Willem de Kooning\u2019s \u201cClamdigger\u201d sculpture in the entryway, Picasso\u2019s portrait of Sara Murphy above the fireplace and Ed Ruscha\u2019s \u201cHollywood\u201d pastel and graphite on paper in the master bedroom.Mr. Hill \u2014 who, with his slicked-back hair and smooth demeanor, is said to have inspired the look of Gordon Gekko in \u201cWall Street\u201d (a claim Mr. Hill says is inaccurate) \u2014 not only wants to share more of his collection with the public. He also wants his gallery to provide arts education to city students.\u201cThey\u2019re cutting out arts programs in the public schools,\u201d he said.\u201cThese are kids who wouldn\u2019t even think the Frick was accessible to them,\u201d Mr. Hill said.The foundation also plans to become a partner in educational efforts with institutions like the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Mr. Hill serves on the board.In preparing for this venture, Mr. Hill said he considered other private museums, including the financier Glenn Fuhrman\u2019s FLAG Art Foundation in Chelsea; the oil trader Andrew Hall\u2019s art foundation in Germany; and the billionaire industrialist Mitchell P. Rales\u2019s Glenstone museum in Potomac, Md.Some private museums have been criticized as tax-exempt exhibition spaces that allow collectors to deduct the full market value of the art, cash and stocks they donate.Mr. Hill acknowledged that the tax benefit was part of his motivation. \u201cI can shelter capital gains,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be the same as if I gave the art to a museum.\u201dBut he also said he would never open a gallery near one of his residences, as the paper magnate Peter Brant has done in Greenwich, Conn.\u201cThe I.R.S. understands the value of these operating art foundations, but they also want to be really clear that there\u2019s a distinction between the personal side and the operating art foundation side,\u201d he added. \u201cThe I.R.S. is absolutely right.\u201dThe space, with free admission, is to be open during the week (at hours to be determined) and on Saturdays, when Chelsea galleries typically get the most traffic. Mainly, Mr. Hill wants to have more of what he owns on view.\u201cHe has great things,\u201d said the dealer Matthew Marks, from whom Mr. Hill recently purchased a Robert Gober sculpture that will permanently reside in the new gallery.Some time ago, the Hills decided to collect in depth, which Mr. Hill defines as owning \u201cat least four\u201d works by an artist.They originally concentrated on eight: Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Cy Twombly, Mr. Ruscha, Brice Marden, Lucio Fontana and Agnes Martin. More recently, they added Mr. Wool and Mark Grotjahn.\u201cI had an amazing Rothko but couldn\u2019t find another three,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cI sold the Rothko to buy another Bacon.\u201dMr. Hill doesn\u2019t sell very often, despite the soaring value of what he owns. \u201cThe idea of buying art for investment makes no sense,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you have no idea what is going to go up.\u201dWould the value of the contemporary Chinese art he bought increase, for example? \u201cI don\u2019t really care,\u201d he said.Nor is Mr. Hill interested in putting his name on a building, he insists, though he has the means to do so. (Last year Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.2 billion.) As a Met trustee, he could conceivably christen that museum\u2019s planned contemporary and Modern wing, for which the institution needs to raise money.\u201cI\u2019m not into wings,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m into art.\u201dWalking through his apartment, he likened the three Wools in his study to \u201ca cup of black coffee\u201d and described Warhol as \u201can incredible draftsman\u201d in pointing out the artist\u2019s \u201cCampbell\u2019s Soup Can: Consomm\u00e9\u201d and \u201cRed Close Cover Before Striking,\u201d both from 1962.Mr. Hill said his collecting had been enhanced by his personal relationships with artists. (Warhol, he said, regularly attended Mass at his church, St. Vincent Ferrer.)That circle now includes Richard Prince, Mr. Grotjahn and Mr. Wool.\u201cIf you own their work, they\u2019re interested in, \u2018Who is that person who wants to buy this from my personal collection?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hill said.He also said that it bothered artists when collectors sell their work. When the former hedge fund manager David Ganek sold Mr. Wool\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d for example, at Christie\u2019s in 2013 for $26.5 million, \u201cthat really upset Christopher,\u201d Mr. Hill said.Born and raised in New York City, Mr. Hill grew up going to museums. (His mother sculpted in clay and bronze until her death at 98 last September.) After a blue-chip education (Buckley in Manhattan, Milton Academy in Massachusetts, Harvard for college and business school), Mr. Hill married in 1980. The couple started buying still lifes by the Danish painter Johan Laurentz Jensen, ultimately acquiring 14.\u201cWe wanted to figure out what we liked,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cand then figure out what we wanted to look at in our home.\u201dIn the 1990s, the pair grew more serious, buying the Warhol Soup Can at auction for $400,000.Mr. Hill said Ms. Hill got \u201ctotal veto power.\u201d\u201cI do the research,\u201d he added, \u201cand then I say: \u2018What about this? What about this?\u2019\u201dMs. Hill wouldn\u2019t, for example, let her husband buy a Warhol electric chair painting in the \u201990s, because she thought their friends would find it disturbing. (He ultimately prevailed and now owns a chair from the Death and Disaster series, which he proudly called \u201cthe best in terms of color quality.\u201d)They have two grown daughters, Margot, a financier at Morgan Stanley, and Astrid, an art adviser who trained at Christie\u2019s (where Mr. Hill is on the advisory board).Mr. Hill credits conversations with curators like Diane Waldman, formerly of the Guggenheim Museum, and James Demetrion, the former director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington \u2014 where Mr. Hill served as chairman \u2014 for helping him understand artists like Rothko.These days, Mr. Hill said he and Sheena Wagstaff, the chairwoman of the Met\u2019s department of Modern and contemporary art, \u201chave deep conversations\u201d about artists like Mr. Wool and Mr. Grotjahn.\u201cHe\u2019s a collector who collects in depth around certain artists,\u201d Ms. Wagstaff said. \u201cBut he is also alive to other artists.\u201dMr. Hill said much of his collection might ultimately end up at the Met, which is eager for major Modern and contemporary donations. \u201cThe Met needs everything I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.He doesn\u2019t go to art fairs or rely on an art adviser. He has every exhibition catalog of the main artists he collects and likes nothing better than to spend hours \u201creading and thinking about art.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you can put a serious collection together with an art adviser,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to make your own decisions, make your own mistakes.\u201dWhile a competitive collector, Mr. Hill doesn\u2019t always get what he wants. \u201cI\u2019ve been after this one Bacon for 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made multiple offers.\u201d (The owner doesn\u2019t want to sell.)In his new space \u2014 which will have a full-time curator and security staff \u2014 Mr. Hill is particularly interested in the juxtaposition of different artists and eras, just as the Frick show paired his bronzes with his postwar art.Mr. Hill also wants to explore artists in relationship to one another \u2014 how Bacon claimed Rembrandt was an inspiration, for example, \u201cbut never acknowledged he was influenced by Rubens,\u201d he said. (Mr. Hill owns five Rubens.)He is considering a show on the use of palette knife techniques, which enabled artists like Jean Dubuffet and Twombly to develop their figuration.And Mr. Hill plans to discuss with the dealer Mr. Marks the idea of a show on how Mr. Marden was influenced by the Greeks.\u201cI\u2019ve got all these ideas,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to find a curator to say, \u2018You\u2019re out of your mind.\u2019\u201dAn article on Friday about plans by J. Tomilson Hill, vice chairman at the Blackstone Group private equity firm, to open a museum in Manhattan to display some of his art collection misspelled the given name of one of the artists on whom he and his wife, Janine, concentrated when they started collecting in depth. He is Brice Marden, not Bryce.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Your Financial Life Feels Like Whac-A-Mole", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyNobody knows where the mocking animals will emerge next. Then, when they do appear, they are ever elusive. And we are rarely fast enough or strong enough to wallop them all.Given how neatly these facts mirror our flailing efforts to manage our personal affairs, it makes perfect sense that so many people in recent weeks have embraced Whac-A-Mole as the metaphor for our complicated lives.So this week, as stock markets yo-yoed in the wake of Britain\u2019s unexpected vote to exit the European Union and families prepared to hit the midway for the long weekend, I put some questions to former carnies turned financial advisers and Whac-A-Mole winners on Coney Island in Brooklyn. What do the strong feelings of unpredictability, elusiveness and urgency inspired by Whac-A-Mole teach us about how \u2014 and how not \u2014 to run our financial lives?The game is simple. Five moles pop up from a board at random, and your job is to hit them with a mallet before they duck out of reach. If you are playing against other people, as you might at a carnival, the first person to hit a certain number of moles wins. If you are alone, at an arcade, the moles come faster and faster until you miss too many or time expires, depending on the version of the game.Something about the whacking is both primal and universal. So much so that Bob\u2019s Space Racers, the Daytona Beach, Fla., company that owns the license for the carnival and arcade versions of the game, figures that people spend at least $100 million on it each year across about 80 countries.But the game is not rigged. It merely plays upon some of our worst tendencies. Some old Bob\u2019s Space Racers promotional material acknowledged it outright: \u201cFor adults who challenge the mole, the game becomes an action-packed analogy for the things in life that elude us.\u201dSo what are those things we think we want or can do?In practice, that often means making the mistake of selling when stocks fall, out of certainty that they will fall further still and buying after they have already gone up, once things are certain to be safe. That course of action runs the risk of locking in losses and then buying when markets are at their peak. Many people who sold stocks at midday on Monday probably regret it now that stocks have recovered most of their losses.Mr. Struthers, whose business is in Chanhassen, Minn., is a former blackjack dealer, so he knows the type. Those friends of his clients may talk a good game, but they, like the gamblers he met at his tables, only talk about their winners.\u201cWhac-A-Mole is a game of chasing a fleeting target, often just missing it,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, many people feel the same way with their finances, whether chasing debt, investment return or a perceived gap in their quality of life.\u201dThe seeming pace of change, of action, makes it feel as if we need to react at twitch speed, too. On Monday, Catherine Cardiello danced and yelped after winning two straight Whac-A-Mole games on Coney Island. \u201cJust go fast,\u201d said Ms. Cardiello, a former Wall Street trader. \u201cThe only thing I liked about trading was the pace. I want fast, and I want a result, and then I either suffer or celebrate.\u201dIt is a fine approach to the trading pits and winning at whacking. But there is not much in our own financial lives that requires such haste. In fact, hair-trigger decision making on investing or spending quite often leads to regret.Newer versions of Whac-A-Mole reward the player who hits the animal at just the right moment \u2014 at its apex once it has fully emerged from the hole. That may be a metaphor that all of us can live by, as making a move that is not too fast and not too slow may be the difference between wielding the mallet and being the mole.Advertisement"}

Yet they seem to know less about the subject than they did then.And most people didn\u2019t even know much about it in 2009.In fact, they suggest that misplaced self-confidence is putting millions of people at risk. They are vulnerable to major missteps \u2014 and to exploitation by industry pros who may not have their best interests at heart.Five of the questions have been on the quiz for years, making statistical comparisons possible. The trend is not encouraging. Only 37 percent of the people who took the quiz were able to get four of these five questions right in 2015. That compares with 39 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2009.The worst performance was on a question about how bond prices respond to rising interest rates. Only 28 percent of people in 2015 got that one right.This isn\u2019t just academic. It\u2019s the core explanation for why bond mutual funds, on average, returned 2.6 percent in the second quarter of this year, a very handsome performance and one that was better than that of stock mutual funds, which gained 2.2 percent, according to Morningstar. Falling interest rates drove bond prices higher.What\u2019s more, it\u2019s critical to understanding the effects of one of the more important and puzzling phenomena of current markets: the proliferation of negative interest rates. The rate-bond seesaw is why negative interest rates \u2014 which have been spreading as central banks seek to stimulate a still sluggish global economy \u2014 can produce positive returns, when rates are still dropping further. Should you buy a bond with negative interest rates? Certainly not if you don\u2019t understand bond basics.The new question in the quiz focuses on a problem that lands many people in trouble when they pay only the minimum amount each month on their credit card balances: compound interest.\u201cSuppose you owe $1,000 on a loan and the interest rate you are charged is 20 percent per year compounded annually,\u201d the quiz asks. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t pay anything off, at this interest rate, how many years would it take for the amount you owe to double?\u201dThe correct answer is two to four years (actually, it is about 3.6 years, but it\u2019s a multiple-choice quiz). Most people thought it took much longer than that, grossly underestimating the impact of interest charges. As the study points out, this lack of knowledge hurts now and could become lethal: When interest rates rise, if you ignore compound interest, you can drown in debt.An alarming aspect of the study is that although most people knew very little, they felt great about what they knew \u2014 or thought they knew. \u201cAmericans tend to have positively biased self-perceptions of their financial knowledge,\u201d the study said. And the positive bias has been increasing.The study found that 76 percent gave themselves a \u201cvery high\u201d rating on financial knowledge in 2015, compared with 73 percent in 2012 and 67 percent in 2009. And while 81 percent of Americans rated their own financial behavior positively, the study found a \u201cpotential disconnect between perceptions and actions in day-to-day financial matters.\u201dLarge numbers of people, for example, said they were running up late fees and interest payments on credit cards, overdrawing bank accounts and borrowing money from costly nonbank sources.The good news is that many households are in better financial shape than they were in 2009 \u2014 but then, they ought to be, because financial conditions are much better. In 2009, the prices of homes and most other assets had fallen sharply, foreclosures were rife and unemployment was soaring. People had been taking financial risks, and they paid for it. In that period, as an example, only 24 percent of home buyers paid more than than 20 percent of the purchase price as a down payment. By 2015, people were behaving more conservatively: a third managed to make that big a down payment. And in 2015, fewer people were having trouble paying their bills and more people said they were comfortable with their financial condition.Still, the survey found that significant hardships continued, \u201cLarge segments of society continue to face financial difficulties, particularly minority populations and those without a college education.\u201dMost Americans are still worried that they won\u2019t have enough money to retire, but only 39 percent have ever tried to figure out how much they will need. When financial conditions worsen \u2014 and whenever the next recession hits, they certainly will \u2014 indicators of financial well-being will certainly decline. But unless the state of financial literacy improves radically by then, vast numbers of people won\u2019t be equipped to deal with these problems.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets, Even in Turmoil, Have a Place in a Portfolio", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOver the last five years, investors in emerging-markets mutual funds have paid plenty and gotten little in return.Emerging-markets funds lost an annualized average of 3.19 percent over the last five years, Morningstar said. Yet they are far more expensive, on average, than actively managed domestic large-cap funds, which returned about 10 percent a year annualized for the same period. Expense ratios for actively managed emerging-market funds were 1.55 percent, compared with 1.15 percent for domestic large-caps.Investors have responded by fleeing emerging markets; money is churning out of the sector\u2019s funds and E.T.F.s. Total net outflows hit a new high in 2015, when nearly $75 billion exited, according to EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass. Through June this year, $7 billion more has been withdrawn.The exodus is understandable, given both the returns and the worrisome headlines streaming in from around the globe. Just last month, the British referendum to leave the European Union roiled markets worldwide. MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Index fell as much as the British-focused FTSE 100 in the days just after the ballots were counted. The vote was an additional bedevilment for emerging markets already made skittish by slower growth in China \u2014 some commentators fret about a real estate bubble and banking crisis there \u2014 and a political crisis in Brazil. On top of that, low prices for commodities, especially oil, sapped stock markets in places dependent on natural resources, like Russia, South America and the Middle East.The turmoil is a turnabout from just a few years ago. Then the acronym \u201cBRIC\u201d \u2014 for Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 was bandied about in investment circles as shorthand for the rise of a brash new bunch of economic powers. Lately, BRIC has become a four-letter epithet.The reaction of emerging markets to the British vote has also underscored a new reality for investors: Emerging markets no longer provide the diversification benefit they once did, said Roger A. Aliaga-D\u00edaz, senior economist with Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cCorrelations have increased since the 2000s between emerging markets and developed ones,\u201d Mr. Aliaga-D\u00edaz said.During the surge of the 2000s, one of the attractions of emerging markets was that they tended to zig when the developed world zagged. They could buffer the ups and downs of developed markets in a diversified portfolio. To a greater extent these days, developing and developed markets have tended to move together.Portfolio managers of emerging-markets funds say today\u2019s worries, like yesterday\u2019s euphoria, may be exaggerated.Even so, many emerging countries remain healthier than developed ones, with higher growth rates and lower debt levels, she said. And many of them have young, growing populations striving to join the world\u2019s middle class.That slowdown has caused worldwide commodity prices to sag. When China was investing heavily in infrastructure and industrialization, commodity producers thrived; now they\u2019re pinched.The emerging-markets sector is split by the debate over active management versus indexing just as every sector is.For the most part, the higher costs for active management haven\u2019t translated into better performance, said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. Based on trailing returns, two-thirds of emerging markets funds underperformed S.&P.\u2019s emerging-markets index over the one, three and five years ending in December 2015, he said. \u201cOn the positive side, that means one out of three did outperform,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s some value to active management, but the cheaper your actively managed fund can be, the better,\u201d he said.Costs aside, Patricia Oey, a senior analyst for Morningstar, said that active funds aren\u2019t locked into the country allocations required by index funds. Both the Vanguard and iShares funds, for example, allocate about a quarter of their assets to Chinese stocks. That amount could grow in coming years, because China\u2019s domestic A-share market is opening to foreign investors, she said. Given the heft of China\u2019s economy \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest, after the United States \u2014 index providers might opt to include more Chinese companies.A way in which some emerging-markets managers avoid overexposure to any particular country is by also investing in developed-world multinationals that sell into the emerging world.\u201cIn my view, those aren\u2019t run for shareholders \u2014 they\u2019re run for the state,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather invest in an A. O. Smith, a U.S. company that makes water heaters. About a third of their revenue is from emerging markets, particularly India and China.\u201dJust as portfolio managers damp risk by diversifying, individual investors can do the same with their personal portfolios. Ms. Oey of Morningstar said holding 10 percent of a stock portfolio, mirroring the proportion of emerging markets in the world\u2019s stock market capitalization, would make sense for a long-term investor. A person with 60 percent of her money in stocks would then put 6 percent in emerging markets.Whatever else investors do, they should guard against the tendency to dump their holdings based on recent discouraging news or weak returns, Professor Harvey said. \u201cThe biggest mistake retail investors make is selling stocks if they go down and buying the ones that have gone up,\u201d he said.\u201cThis holds true for asset classes, too,\u201d he added. \u201cJust because emerging-markets equity has had low returns recently does not mean you should sell. One-third of world G.D.P. is being driven by emerging-market economies, and it makes sense that a globally diversified portfolio should have exposure to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All six vials were missing.\u201cI\u2019d been completely focused on having something of Aaron\u2019s live on, and now there was nothing,\u201d said Ms. Robertson in an interview at her in-laws\u2019 home in Montecito.Now she and her in-laws are suing the Los Angeles clinic, and its owner, Dr. Peyman Saadat, accusing them of negligence, fraud, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit, filed in May, also says the clinic misappropriated Mr. Robertson\u2019s sperm \u2014 which had a 50 percent chance of carrying Marfan syndrome, the disorder that killed him \u2014 and used it to supply other patients who would not know to undergo testing to ensure their babies did not inherit the disorder.The Robertsons\u2019 case is part of a new wave of lawsuits against sperm banks, highlighting claims of deception and negligence, and adding an array of challenges beyond the longstanding issue of undetected genetic problems.Dr. Saadat declined to be interviewed, but denied the accusations in a statement.Frozen sperm has become a major industry, dominated by a few large sperm banks, but with smaller stocks of sperm maintained at hundreds of assisted-reproduction centers nationwide. The Food and Drug Administration requires that donor sperm be tested for infectious diseases. Beyond that, sperm banks are lightly regulated. Several states require health department licensing of the labs, but only New York conducts routine inspections.Some of the new cases accuse sperm banks of careless record-keeping, or mishandling or misappropriation of sperm banked for a client\u2019s personal use. Others say the banks use hyped, misleading descriptions to market their donors.Several cases accuse a Georgia facility of marketing sperm as belonging to a neuroscientist with a genius-level I.Q. who turned out to be a schizophrenic felon, and who has fathered at least 36 children.\u201cEven in New York, when they inspect, they\u2019re looking at hygienic conditions not record-keeping,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at New York University. \u201cNobody confirms that you have what you say you have.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absurd that we have these materials so valuable that people pay to store them, but we run it like a 19th-century grocery,\u201d he continued. \u201cCryopreservation has historically operated in a casual laissez-faire environment, where people were just supposed to trust.\u201dSperm banks are not required to verify the information provided by donors, and lawyers familiar with the industry say many do not. They set their own limits on how many children a donor can sire, but unless the mothers voluntarily report the births, they may not know how many half-siblings are out there. Some, including the two largest, California Cryobank in Los Angeles and Fairfax Cryobank, headquartered in Virginia, test for many genetic conditions, while others test for very few.So it is buyer-beware \u2014 for people banking their own sperm for personal use after cancer treatment, and for those relying on a sperm bank\u2019s description of an anonymous donor.Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said his group did not see a need for further regulation and believed that the industry was generally reliable.\u201cAll indications are that sperm donation has been a terrific way to help people start a family even if, as with anything that involves humans, there are mistakes and some less-than-perfect actors,\u201d he said.In the past, few problems with sperm came to light, because most families were unwilling to discuss such an intimate matter in public. But that is changing, with a demographic shift in sperm buyers.Once, sperm banks mostly served heterosexual married couples in which the husband had a fertility problem, but today about two-thirds of the buyers are either lesbian couples and single women, who are more open about their children\u2019s origins. With genetic testing widely available and relatively cheap, the concept of donor anonymity is increasingly open to question.\u201cI can personally attest that there are more cases than you ever hear about, but almost all settle before they get to court,\u201d said Andrew Vorzimer, a California fertility lawyer representing the Robertsons.\u201cPeople think it\u2019s a medical industry, it must be regulated and trustworthy, but it\u2019s just sperm sellers,\u201d said Ms. Kramer, whose registry, founded in 2000, has more than 50,000 members, and has connected more than 13,000 relatives. \u201cThey can say whatever they want.\u201dIn Florida, California, Canada and England, lawsuits are pending against Xytex, the Georgia facility that sold sperm from Donor 9623, James Christian Aggeles. The lawsuit claims the sperm bank described Mr. Aggeles as a genius-level neuroscientist with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees who was pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience engineering. Instead, according to court papers, Mr. Aggeles did not have a college degree, had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and had an arrest record that included burglary.Many of the families that used Mr. Aggeles\u2019s sperm had already found each other before Xytex sent an email that accidentally included his email address, prompting intense internet sleuthing by the mothers to discover his identity.\u201cWe found out a lot of things about him from public information,\u201d said Angie Collins, an Ontario woman with a 9-year-old son fathered by Mr. Aggeles. \u201cXytex could have done that, too, if they\u2019d wanted to. I think sperm banks should be required to get the donor\u2019s medical records, and run a criminal background check.\u201dXytex would not discuss the case but Ted Lavender, a lawyer for the company, said in a statement that Xytex \u201ccomplies with all industry standards.\u201dJennifer Cramblett, a white Ohio mother who mistakenly got sperm from a black donor, is suing the Midwest Sperm Bank in Downers Grove, Ill., on the grounds of negligence. She and her partner had been sent vials from Donor 330, an African-American donor, rather than Donor 380, the white donor they had chosen, according to her lawsuit.No one at the Midwest Sperm Bank would discuss the case.Dr. Saadat, who was sued by Ms. Robertson, also faces a suit by Justin Hollman, a California man who froze five vials of his sperm before undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer at age 20. Years later, Mr. Hollman wanted his sperm transferred to his wife\u2019s fertility doctor. When he was presented with paperwork, his lawsuit says, he noticed that it authorized the destruction of his sperm instead of the transfer.After refusing to sign, the court papers say, Mr. Hollman got a call from Dr. Saadat later that day telling him the samples had been destroyed as a result of \u201chuman error.\u201dMr. Hollman declined to discuss the case, and repeated calls to Dr. Saadat\u2019s center and to his lawyers were not returned.The Robertsons\u2019 lawsuit also claims there was deception by the center, which on different occasions said the sperm either had never been stored there or had been destroyed in a fire. When Ms. Robertson initially asked for the sperm, according to court papers, the center told her that five of the six vials were missing. The complaint went on to say that Dr. Saadat urged her to try to get pregnant with the sixth vial, but the clinic\u2019s manager later emailed that the sixth vial, too, was gone.\u201cWhen I got that email, I stood up and screamed,\u201d said Ms. Robertson, who is a nurse practitioner.The Robertsons still wonder what sperm Dr. Saadat would have used if Ms. Robertson had agreed to use the purported last vial to get pregnant.\u201cWas he just going to take someone\u2019s sample at random?\u201d Ms. Robertson asked. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to imagine a health care business being operated so recklessly.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the age of Angie Collins\u2019s son.

{"Headline": "Growing Unease as British Mutual Funds Block the Exit Doors", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byAs one British mutual fund after another bars its doors to fleeing investors, traders and regulators alike are asking the same question: What does it mean for nervous global markets?So far, the numbers are small enough. Of the 35 billion pounds, or $45 billion, invested in these funds, just under \u00a320 billion has been affected.Yet to see, in real time, fund companies turning away investors because they cannot quickly unload assets that are hard to sell brings to life a nightmare situation that has long kept central bankers and large investment managers awake at night.\u201cThe market has gotten crowded,\u201d said Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yield bonds for Amundi Smith Breeden, a global investment company that manages $1 trillion. \u201cAt some point you have to wonder what happens if all these investors decide to go home.\u201dPerhaps the purest principle of investing in such funds is the understanding that an investor who wants to get out of the fund, or redeem shares, will immediately receive his or her money back.For that to happen, the portfolio manager must either have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell enough stocks or bonds quickly enough to satisfy investors on the run.What the recent developments in Britain clearly show, however, is that British fund companies are less beholden to this principle than their American counterparts.A close reading of their prospectuses reveals blunt language that gives the investment manager every right to halt redemptions under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to protect the interests of investors with a longer-term investment horizon.British fund companies, more so than their American counterparts, are also ready to take drastic steps, beyond just blocking the door, to prevent investors from leaving their funds.Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the largest fund managers in Britain, has marked down the value of the assets in its property fund (as well as its related feeder fund) by 17 percent, a bold move that in effect tells investors: Go ahead and take your money out if you want, but you will pay a price to do so at this time.Hedge funds routinely have rules that lock up investors\u2019 money for a period of time. But American mutual funds are granted such restrictions by the Securities and Exchange Commission only in the most extreme circumstances \u2014 as was the case with Third Avenue.What the moves by these British fund managers have also highlighted is the extent to which fund companies around the world are willing to take risks to satisfy rising investor demand for high-yielding returns when interest rates hover near zero.The yields on these funds can approach 4 percent \u2014 quite attractive when compared with the miserly returns that banks and government securities were offering.In Britain, this push for yield has played out in the booming market for commercial real estate in London and beyond. The Bank of England, in its report, said that property funds issued by British investment companies had exploded to \u00a335 billion from \u00a35 billion since 2009.When it comes to \u201clonger dated and potentially illiquid assets,\u201d as the Bank of England describes these investments, few fit the bill more precisely than the commercial properties to which British fund companies like Aberdeen, Henderson and Columbia Threadneedle offer maximum exposure through their mutual funds.These could range from a row of retail shops in Slough, a town west of London, where the British version of \u201cThe Office\u201d was set, to a prime office development in London. Because skyscrapers and office parks do not trade as securities on an exchange, they are hard to value and sell.And that, experts say, is what makes them a risky proposition for open-ended funds that promise to deliver cash to investors when they ask for it.The contrast with real estate mutual funds in the United States is stark.While large fund companies like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity have open-ended real estate funds that are of a similar size to their British counterparts, they invest a majority of their assets in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which in most cases trade on public exchanges, making them easier to value and sell.Take for example the \u00a34 billion British property fund managed by Henderson, which was one of the funds that prevented investors from pulling out this week. In its annual report for last year, the company said 76 percent of its portfolio was invested in 128 commercial properties, with the rest in cash or real estate investments sold on exchanges.Aberdeen had a similarly constructed portfolio for its \u00a34 billion property fund.By any measure, these are very large portfolio allocations to investments that do not trade on an exchange.For now, investors in London and abroad seem to have taken the British fund moves in stride. While they reflect broader uncertainty about the British real estate market and economy after the referendum, there has not yet been a broad wave of investors looking to exit high-risk, high-return mutual funds around the globe.The words of caution from the Bank of England were jarring nonetheless.\u201cThese funds offer short-term redemptions to investors while in some cases investing in longer-dated and potentially illiquid assets,\u201d the report concluded, warning that a frantic selling spree by investors in the funds could overwhelm securities markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Profit Bump for Companies, and Tax Transparency for Investors", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byFair GameThink the world of accounting is dull? Then you don\u2019t know about the new auditing rule that is about to raise many companies\u2019 reported profits and bring greater clarity to the actual taxes big corporations pay.The new rule relates to the tax benefit that a company receives when it gives options to executives and workers. The change doesn\u2019t affect what a company must pay in taxes related to its stock option grants. It simply shifts the place where a company reports the options-related tax benefit. The shift makes the benefit more evident to investors.The standards board changed the rule as part of its accounting simplification program, intended to reduce the costs and complexities of auditing standards and maintain \u201cthe usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements,\u201d as the regulator put it.But the change will have other effects. Along with appearing to juice many companies\u2019 net earnings, it is likely to bring the spotlight back to the issue of low corporate taxes in America, possibly reigniting that debate.Bear with me while I explain the mechanics of the rule.Every year, companies generate a tax benefit when they issue nonqualified stock options, the most common type. (Nonqualified options are ones that don\u2019t qualify to be taxed at a more beneficial rate for the recipient.) The amount of the benefit to the company equals the cost of the options at the time they were dispensed multiplied by the company\u2019s effective tax rate, generally 35 percent in the United States.A company does not immediately realize this tax benefit, though. Rather, it becomes a deferred tax asset on a company\u2019s books. Only when employees exercise their options does a deduction actually occur.To compute how much a company is allowed to deduct from its taxes at that point, it must compare the exercise price of the option at the time of the grant with the stock price when the employee exercised it.When stocks are rising, as they have been recently, employees typically exercise their options at far higher levels than the prices at which the options were granted. That creates a larger tax benefit for a company than it anticipated; this excess amount is what the company deducts from its taxes.Nothing about this process has changed. What\u2019s different under the new rule is where the deduction shows up on a company\u2019s books.Under previous rules, the stock option tax benefit counted as a credit on a company\u2019s balance sheet. But with the new rule, F.A.S.B. requires that the deduction run through the income statement. This deduction will enhance net profits, especially among big option issuers like health care and technology companies.The bigger a company\u2019s option grants, of course, the larger the effects of the rule will be on its net earnings.In addition to making some companies\u2019 bottom lines look better, Mr. Willens said, the deductions associated with the new rule will bring into focus the low tax rates these companies now pay. By shifting the tax benefit to the income statement, investors will have a much clearer picture of the actual tax outlays their companies make.The fact is, few companies pay the 35 percent effective corporate tax rate in the United States. Popular tax-reducing tactics \u2014 such as keeping cash earned overseas where tax rates are lower than in the United States \u2014 bring companies\u2019 actual cash outlays for taxes far below their effective rates.Unfortunately, a company\u2019s true tax rate is not something investors can determine from reading its financial statements. But the change in stock options accounting will give investors a closer approximation of the taxes a company actually pays.Consider Facebook, a big options granter. Its most recent annual financial filing indicates that it has $1.72 billion in unrecorded excess tax benefits resulting from share-based awards it has dispensed.\u201cOnce this proposal is implemented,\u201d Mr. Willens said, the company\u2019s \u201ceffective tax rate will go down by two-thirds. Instead of being 40 percent, it will be maybe 12 or 13 percent.\u201dOf course, Facebook\u2019s true tax rate may be even lower than that \u2014 we can\u2019t tell. Still, the glimpse of what corporations actually pay in taxes, brought to light by the F.A.S.B. rule change, \u201ccould become a P.R. problem for these companies,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cSome companies are going to be unhappy that these amounts will be reflected in the income statements, because they will be subjected to more criticism.\u201dEmployee stock grants are one of the costs that companies typically remove when adjusting their earnings. So to the degree that the new rule makes a company\u2019s net profits look better, it will no longer be necessary to deduct stock options costs to achieve that end, Mr. Willens said.Overall, the F.A.S.B. rule change will present a truer picture of a company\u2019s financial position, in Mr. Willens\u2019s view. \u201cIt never made a lot of sense that the excess tax benefits bypassed the income statement and were credited to the balance sheet,\u201d he said. \u201cThese companies were not paying taxes on account of option exercises, but the financial statements made it look like they were. Companies\u2019 tax rates were overstated, and there can\u2019t be any defense for that.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Good News for Bond Buyers That May Be Fleeting", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe jury is still out on whether the negative-yield experiment playing out in Japan and across Europe will deliver on its intended goal of spurring economic growth. But central banks have managed to engineer some short-term good news for American bond investors.Negative yields have served as a powerful magnet pulling rates down just about everywhere, and as yields fall, bond prices rise. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union pushed yields down even further in late June, helping to bolster prices.For the second quarter, the average intermediate core United States bond fund posted a solid 2.3 percent total return and gained 4.9 percent in the first six months of the year, nearly one percentage point ahead of the gain for the S.&P. 500. (Total return is the combined result of the yield you are paid and any changes to the underlying prices of the bonds you own.)Don\u2019t count on that lasting.\u201cWe have stepped through the looking glass,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman wealth management. Even with negative rates in much of the world, interest rates could move lower in the near term, yet the expectation is that they will eventually begin to move off their historic lows, which will cause bond prices and investor total returns to fall.Goldman Sachs estimates that a one percentage point rise in interest rates would reduce the value of bonds in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index \u2014 the benchmark for high-quality core bond investments \u2014 by $1 trillion.\u201cThe rise in yields from where we are now comes with no cushion.\u201d Mr. Clemons said. \u201cPeople need to get used to looking at unrealized capital losses.\u201dYet with so many investors seeking safety and streaming into bonds, actual losses are being pushed into the future.Still, BlackRock and Vanguard expect annualized returns for core United States bonds to be around 1 percent or so over the next five to 10 years. That\u2019s even before accounting for inflation; real returns would probably be below zero.\u201cIt\u2019s basic arithmetic,\u201d said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, referring to the fact that a bond\u2019s current yield predicts future returns.Rick Rieder, BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer of global fixed income, points out that 10 years ago, most fixed income investments had yields of at least 3 percent. At the end of June, the 10-year Treasury note yielded 1.5 percent. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond E.T.F., which tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, has a trailing 12-month yield of 2.3 percent, barely ahead of the rate of inflation. The only way to earn 3 percent these days is to stick your neck out into high-yield and emerging-market debt. \u201cIn this environment, counting on core fixed income for returns is going to be difficult,\u201d Mr. Rieder said.Pursuing higher yields always means taking on more risk, but those risks are magnified right now. Sure, longer-term bonds pay marginally higher yields. But those yields are still well below historic norms and thus won\u2019t offer much of a cushion when prices rise. And the longer the maturity of a bond, the more price volatility you will incur when rates rise. And junk bonds and emerging-market debt need careful consideration at this point in the economic cycle.\u201cWe are of the opinion that investors shouldn\u2019t reach for yield now and should accept lower returns,\u201d said Stephen M. Kane, a portfolio manager in the United States Fixed Income Group at TCW, which runs more than $150 billion in bond portfolios, including the $78 billion Metropolitan West Total Return mutual fund.The fund has about 60 percent of assets in a mix of cash and low-yielding \u2014 but superliquid \u2014 Treasuries and government agency bonds, and its current yield is below 2 percent. Its one-year gain of 4.4 percent lagged the Barclays Aggregate by nearly one percentage point.Mr. Kane said that performance was \u201cfrustrating\u201d but the managers don\u2019t want to be aggressive in this market. \u201cOur defensive strategy today,\u201d he added, \u201cis the dry powder that we will be able to invest once valuations are better.\u201dTaking the long view has paid off for patient investors. Over the last 10 and 15 years, MetWest Total Return ranks in the top 5 percent of similar portfolios, according to Morningstar.Granted, the prospect of watching your core bond portfolio fail to keep pace with inflation isn\u2019t cheery news, but it\u2019s worth reminding yourself why you own bonds in the first place.\u201cAll too often, investors forget that low returns are far better than big losses,\u201d said Harold Evensky, chairman of Evensky & Katz/Foldes Financial Wealth Management. \u201cWhen markets turn down \u2014 and they will \u2014 even zero returns will look pretty attractive.\u201dJoe Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of its investment strategy group, puts the odds at \u201cwell over 90 percent\u201d that we are due for a stock bear market in the next few years. In 2008, when the S.&P. 500 lost 37 percent, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index gained more than 5 percent. Today\u2019s low yields mean bonds probably would not gain that much, but there is no likelihood of a real meltdown, either. Since 1976, the benchmark index has never lost more than 3 percent in a calendar year.Given that the Barclays U.S. Aggregate is now laden with low-yielding government bonds that will be most sensitive to a rate rise, venturing beyond a pure core index fund may be worth considering.BKD Wealth Advisors, which manages more than $2.5 billion, recommended core bond index funds before rates plummeted. But now, said Jeff Layman, BKD\u2019s chief investment officer, the firm relies on actively managed funds, including Metropolitan West Total Return, DoubleLine Total Return and Guggenheim Total Return. These funds might add some incremental performance.Mr. Evensky peppers client portfolios with nontraditional bond funds that aren\u2019t tethered to the Barclays Aggregate, including JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities, Goldman Sachs Strategic Income and BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities.Mr. Rieder, co-manager of BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities, says the challenge today for investors is \u201cHow can I get 2 percent to 4 percent from bonds to help my portfolio?\u201d BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities currently has about 15 percent invested in junk bonds and owns non-United States bonds as well.To improve the chances of achieving a 5 percent annualized return, Mr. Brightman created what he calls a \u201cmaverick\u201d portfolio. It is risky, however. The only United States bonds are long-term Treasuries, and there are no United States stocks. Instead, the portfolio contains a 20 percent stake in emerging market stocks and 20 percent in noninvestment grade bonds, among other asset classes. He estimated that it would generate about 40 percent more volatility than the classic 60-40 approach.Mr. Brightman acknowledges that most investors lack the fortitude to stick their necks out that far, and he doesn\u2019t recommend it for the fainthearted. His advice for dealing with the ramifications of negative interest rates: \u201cSave more, plan on working longer and living more frugally.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Brakel, who trained as a physician in his native Netherlands, oversees pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

It was among Federated Kaufmann\u2019s top 10 holdings on May 31, the most recent data available. Mr. Brakel said its treatment for multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, received early approval from the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cAt the recent annual meeting of the oncologists, people were talking about it having unprecedented efficacy,\u201d he said.A tenet of the growth team\u2019s approach is that they should visit as many companies as possible, Mr. Brakel said. \u201cWhen you ask questions of management, one on one, you get an immediate sense of whether they know what they\u2019re talking about and whether they really know their sector,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick that up from a press release or a PowerPoint presentation. You pick it up when you\u2019re sitting opposite a C.E.O.\u201dThe visits help the eight portfolio managers develop broad networks of contacts in their industries that can lead them to investments.Such knowledge helped Federated Kaufmann decide to invest in Tesaro, a Waltham, Mass., biotech company.

{"Headline": "What China\u2019s Economic Growth Figures Mean", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China on Friday reported its second-quarter economic growth figures. The numbers are among the world\u2019s most closely watched because the country has been a major driver of global economic growth. But data from China are notoriously questionable. This is what you should take away from Friday\u2019s results.China\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent compared with a year ago. Friday\u2019s figure suggests there\u2019s no reason to panic. China\u2019s economy is slowing but at a reasonable, steady pace well in line with Beijing\u2019s expectations. It also matches the first-quarter number, and still came in at a pace that other countries envy.Looking a bit closer, it\u2019s clear that China\u2019s slowdown is uneven. Some sectors, like mining and manufacturing, are being clobbered. Others, like e-commerce and nontraditional finance, are relative bright spots, while the housing market in some big cities is downright frothy.China\u2019s property investment in the first six months of the year rose 6.1 percent from a year ago, compared with 7 percent in the January-to-May period. That slight slowdown in June offers a reminder that new strength from China\u2019s property sector has been pretty uneven.To be sure, the rebound in the property market is helping to prop up growth across the country. Roughly one-quarter of China\u2019s economic activity is related to property. Last year a drop in the market hit China\u2019s growth results, as investors worried about an oversupply of unsold homes, especially in smaller cities, and put their money into stocks instead.Those worries appear to have been swept aside. Land purchases by developers have recovered as builders turn more optimistic. That is also good for local governments, which rely on revenue from land sales to fund a huge portion of their spending. New home sales and construction starts by developers are also rebounding strongly.The question is how sustainable this property recovery might be. Home prices in rich metropolises like Shenzhen and Shanghai are rising at rates reminiscent of dot-com stocks of another era. If the property market becomes just another Chinese bubble, it may not help offset the sharp slowdown among China\u2019s factories.China\u2019s June industrial production rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier, compared with 6 percent in May. Many traditional smokestack industries in China are still struggling, and that is dragging down the broader economy. Despite the slight rise in the June figure, industrial production data indicates that the manufacturing deceleration that China has seen for the last six years shows few signs of bottoming out.China\u2019s zombie factories \u2014 many state owned or state supported \u2014 continue to churn out goods that nobody buys. Weak overseas demand is another problem, and exports have continued to contract this year.There could be some light at the end of the tunnel. Factories would get a big lift if they could regain pricing power. Data on factory pricing shows that deflation appears to be easing at last after four tough years.But the bigger hope is that consumer demand can replace traditional industry as the main driver of China\u2019s economy.China\u2019s June retail sales rose 10.6 percent from a year ago. At first glance, Chinese consumers do appear to be stepping up their game, as June\u2019s figure was an improvement from May\u2019s. But May\u2019s figure was the weakest rate since the 2003 outbreak of SARS, once seasonal distortions like holidays are factored out.China bulls often point to the blistering pace of expansion of e-commerce as one of the country\u2019s brightest growth spots. Online sales of goods rose 27 percent in the first six months, data released Friday showed. Still, that is down sharply from their growth rate a year ago China bears would argue that online shopping platforms are just cannibalizing sales from traditional department stores.China has seen a dramatic falloff in investment by the private sector, previously China\u2019s biggest engine of investment growth. That could have been hugely destabilizing for employment, wages and the economy as a whole. But the government has stepped in with gusto, ramping up investment by the state.There are signs that Beijing is getting less bang for its buck, however, as new infrastructure works and other projects fail to generate the same economic returns that they did in years past. What\u2019s more, this investment surge is being bankrolled by an expanding credit binge. New bank lending has been growing gangbusters this year, raising the risk that China will face a painful day of reckoning further down the road.Advertisement"}
