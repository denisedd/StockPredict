{"Headline": "Valuation Quirks Help End Proposed Polycom-Mitel Merger", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsOverpriced Silicon Valley unicorns are not the only technology-sector valuation oddities. Polycom, a struggling videoconferencing company, and its Canadian rival Mitel Networks just created one by scrapping their merger deal.Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management originally played matchmaker. Last October, the activist hedge fund bought stakes in Polycom and Mitel and urged them to unite. With Polycom as buyer, Elliott reckoned the stock would more than double in a couple of years. About six months later, the idea came to fruition, albeit with the smaller Mitel acquiring Polycom for $2 billion.The cash-and-stock deal offered a 22 percent premium to Polycom shareholders, who also would have owned three-fifths of the enlarged entity. An anticipated $160 million of annual synergies, worth some $1.3 billion once taxed and capitalized, should have foretold plenty of upside.Even so, as often happens with technology companies generating little or no growth, investors were unimpressed. Polycom\u2019s revenue had tumbled 10 percent and its operating income by a third since 2011. Mitel lost money in each of the last three years. Both are under threat from larger competitors such as Cisco as well as from new workplace communication tools offered by the likes of Facebook and Slack.With the deal worth 20 percent less than when it was struck, Polycom last week decided to abandon it in favor of an all-cash offer from the private equity firm Siris Capital. The price is 9 percent lower per share than the original Mitel bid, and Siris will keep all the benefits of any savings. Yet shares of both public companies rose on the news. Though part of that was because of investors who bet on the deal\u2019s prospects unwinding their positions, the episode exemplifies the strange prism through which investors see tech opportunities.In addition to the riches heaped on fast-growing start-ups like Uber, Microsoft can pay a 50 percent premium to buy a weakening but hyped LinkedIn for $26 billion, promise no synergies and still receive a warm reception from the market. A company like Polycom, with dubious prospects, is rewarded more generously for facing its struggles in private than embarking on a money-saving merger with another public company. The same logic used to build tech products doesn\u2019t always get applied when valuing them.An earlier version of the headline on this article misspelled the name of one of the prospective merger partners. It is Polycom, not Ploycom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Technology Is Monitoring the Urban Landscape", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Big City is watching you.It will do it with camera-equipped drones that inspect municipal power lines and robotic cars that know where people go. Sensor-laden streetlights will change brightness based on danger levels. Technologists and urban planners are working on a major transformation of urban landscapes over the next few decades.Much of it involves the close monitoring of things and people, thanks to digital technology. To the extent that this makes people\u2019s lives easier, the planners say, they will probably like it. But troubling and knotty questions of privacy and control remain.Much of the change will also come from the private sector, which is moving faster to reach city dwellers, and is more skilled in collecting and responding to data. That is leading cities everywhere to work more closely than ever with private companies, which may have different priorities than the government.One of the biggest changes that will hit a digitally aware city, it is widely agreed, is the seemingly prosaic issue of parking. Space given to parking is expected to shrink by half or more, as self-driving cars and drone deliveries lead an overall shift in connected urban transport. That will change or eliminate acres of urban space occupied by raised and underground parking structures.Shared vehicles are not parked as much, and with more automation, they will know where parking spaces are available, eliminating the need to drive in search of a space.\u201cOffice complexes won\u2019t need parking lots with twice the footprint of their buildings,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, who led Google\u2019s self-driving car project in its early days and now runs Udacity, an online learning company. \u201cWhen we started on self-driving cars, we talked all the time about cutting the number of cars in a city by a factor of three,\u201d or a two-thirds reduction.In addition, police, fire, and even library services will seek greater responsiveness by tracking their own assets, and partly by looking at things like social media. Later, technologies like three-dimensional printing, new materials and robotic construction and demolition will be able to reshape skylines in a matter of weeks.At least that is the plan. So much change afoot creates confusion.\u201cWe know for sure that there will be a lot of physical changes to our cities,\u201d said Timothy Papandreou, the chief innovation officer for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. \u201cStreets will be redesigned. There will be lots more real-time data. Automation will be everywhere. But it\u2019s also crazy: Things are changing so quickly that we can\u2019t pretend to have all the answers.\u201dOne reason for confidence in a radically changed future is that much of it is already here. The city\u2019s Uber and Lyft, the Boston-based auto-sharing company Zipcar and things like corporate shuttle buses have shown new ways for urban dwellers to use vehicles. Skylines in cities like London and Shanghai are full of unusually shaped buildings, thanks in part to computer-assisted design.Rare robots can build with bricks, or monitor and rebuild the underground water, sewage and electrical pipes that make a city functional. It is hard to find a new municipal vehicle that does not come with a tracking system.To the planners, innovations like automatic cars that learn people\u2019s habits are simply an extension of trends. Mr. Papandreou said 13 companies are testing automated vehicles in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re inviting start-ups to come in and work on the problems we have,\u201d he said.The city is developing a policy for drone-based deliveries. Emergency medical goods, transported from an airport to a hospital, are likely to be first, he said. But consumer goods may eventually be delivered by air.Besides drones, the abundance of vehicles now on urban sidewalks, including motorized wheelchairs, scooters and hoverboards, is another intimation of the variety of ways people and things are expected to move, as digital technologies make these modes of transportation cheaper. Likewise, temporary offices and pop-up stores may foreshadow an urban landscape that changes faster than ever.One danger of the new city may be the age-old faith that technology makes things better, and more tech is best.\u201cThe danger of big dramatic projects is that they become the equivalent of urban renewal or the kind of sweeping things Robert Moses did for cars in New York that created dysfunction,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a technology forecaster. \u201cThe best thing tech could do now is rescue us from the car-centric cities we built after 1930.\u201dThe new techno-optimism is focused on big data and artificial intelligence. \u201cFuturists used to think everyone would have their own plane,\u201d said Erick Guerra, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe never have a good understanding of how things will actually turn out.\u201dHe recently surveyed the 25 largest metropolitan planning organizations in the country and found that almost none have solid plans for modernizing their infrastructure. That may be the right way to approach the challenges of cities full of robots, but so far most clues are coming from companies that also sell the technology.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty, and a competition to show they\u2019re low on regulation,\u201d Mr. Guerra said. \u201cThere is too much potential money for new technology to be regulated out.\u201dThe big tech companies say they are not interested in imposing the sweeping \u201csmart city\u201d projects they used to push, in part because things are changing too quickly. But they still want to build big, and they view digital surveillance as an essential component.\u201cDigital infrastructure is like plumbing or electricity. You can\u2019t just have point-by-point solutions,\u201d said Rick Huijbregts, managing director of the Americas division of the computer networking company Cisco Systems. \u201cCars have to talk to other transit, to traffic lights, to law enforcement.\u201dIs that creepy? \u201cOur next generation, born after 1995, doesn\u2019t know a life without computers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know a way of living without this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
