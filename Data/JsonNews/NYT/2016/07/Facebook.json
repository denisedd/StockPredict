{"Headline": "Donald Trump Postpones Naming Running Mate", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump said on Twitter that he was delaying his announcement after the \u201chorrible attack\u201d in Nice. He did not specify when the event would go forward.In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.Before the attack in southern France, Mr. Pence, a mild-mannered Midwesterner popular with conservatives and evangelical Christians, appeared to be all but locked in as the Republican nominee for vice president \u2014 the last man standing after a madcap selection process unlike any in recent presidential politics.But a certain resolution to the process remained elusive after several days of unusually frenzied and public deliberations by Mr. Trump and his family, as well as extraordinarily overt campaigning for the job by several potential running mates. After huddling with Mr. Pence in Indiana, flying multiple other candidates to Indianapolis for last-minute interviews, hinting to party leaders that his decision had been made and then frantically denying it to the news media, Mr. Trump delayed his decision entirely.Against a backdrop of images from Nice, Mr. Trump repeatedly described himself as the \u201claw-and-order candidate\u201d in the presidential race.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers told national Republican officials that they were preparing to make an announcement with Mr. Pence, and people close to Mr. Pence notified his political allies that they expected him to be chosen, according to numerous people with knowledge of the conversations, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.On Thursday afternoon, television stations in Indiana and New York reported that Mr. Pence had flown from Indiana to Teterboro Airport, arriving in New Jersey late Thursday afternoon for the planned Friday morning event in Midtown Manhattan.But Mr. Trump himself has sent conflicting signals in recent days, as he has subjected his potential running mates to a final round of screening. As of Thursday afternoon, he had not yet formally invited Mr. Pence to join his ticket, nor had he notified two other contenders, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, of his decision, according to people with direct knowledge of the process.Mr. Trump has appeared to vacillate over his choice. Long accustomed to making important strategic decisions by sheer improvisation, he is now faced with the most permanent, and perhaps most important, decision of the campaign.The delay has the potential to complicate a partnership with Mr. Pence, who must file papers in Indiana by noon on Friday withdrawing from his re-election campaign in order for Republicans to field a new candidate for the race.Paul Manafort, the chairman of the Trump campaign, said at midday Thursday that the campaign had not notified anyone of a final decision.\u201dWe have not been reaching out to Washington to tell them to prepare for any particular candidate,\u201d Mr. Manafort said by phone.Mr. Pence\u2019s staunch conservative views on certain social issues, like gay rights and abortion, may inject a new set of concerns into the general election debate that have been largely overlooked with Mr. Trump at the top of the Republican ticket.Mr. Gingrich added that he had told Mr. Trump that a Trump-Gingrich combination would be a bolder pairing of \u201ctwo pirates\u201d on the same ticket.Selecting Mr. Pence, by contrast, might ease relations between Mr. Trump and Republicans in Washington, where party leaders have eyed his every move with grave apprehension.Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke approvingly of Mr. Pence on Thursday: He is seen among his former colleagues there as a conventional politician with standard-issue conservative beliefs, including on some subjects where his policy instincts plainly conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s.Mr. Pence has endorsed free-trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asian trade deal that Mr. Trump has described as a \u201crape\u201d of the American economy. As a House member, Mr. Pence also voted for the Iraq War, which Trump has condemned, and last winter he denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s call to ban all Muslim immigration into the United States.If those views place Mr. Pence at odds with Mr. Trump, they are in line with the outlook of Republican leaders in Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret I\u2019m a big fan of Mike Pence\u2019s,\u201d said Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House from Wisconsin. \u201cWe\u2019re very good friends. I have very high regard for him. I hope that he picks a good movement conservative. Clearly, Mike is one of those.\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said picking Mr. Pence would be a \u201cgood move by Donald Trump.\u201d Mr. McConnell, who has sharply rebuked Mr. Trump in recent weeks for his indiscipline on the campaign trail, said he would \u201clook forward to enthusiastically supporting the ticket.\u201dTo Democrats, Mr. Pence cuts an unimposing profile, and party officials said Thursday they considered him unlikely to transform Mr. Trump\u2019s deeply unpopular public image. On the contrary, his archconservative social views could help motivate liberal voters and young people to turn out for Hillary Clinton in the fall.At the same time, Democrats have looked with some dismay at Mr. Trump\u2019s tenacity in the Midwest, and at his unusual popularity with white men. Mr. Pence could reinforce Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths in both areas.The Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, indicated that the focus of the fall campaign would be Mr. Trump himself.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to help him that much, no matter who he picks,\u201d Mr. Reid said.For Mr. Trump, selecting Mr. Pence would be a sharp departure from habit, and the surest sign yet that he intends to submit to at least some standard political pressures in the general election.Mr. Pence\u2019s public audition for the No. 2 spot, when he appeared with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at a rally in Westfield, Ind., went well. Standing ramrod straight, Mr. Pence offered five and a half minutes of high-energy remarks, frequently turning his fire to Hillary Clinton in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that he could be an attack dog against her.But in the past, Mr. Trump has leaned heavily on a tiny circle of trusted friends and advisers, and has crafted his major political decisions to shock and titillate the news media and Republican primary voters.Mr. Pence is a laid-back personality who does not have the same set of showman\u2019s instincts as Mr. Trump or other vice-presidential contenders like Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Christie.And the Indiana governor has only the scantiest of personal relationships with the man whose political future has rapidly melded with his own.David M.

He lived through the Civil War and World War I. But when the flag went by, you put your hand over your heart.\u201dMr. Sousa said he was \u201caghast\u201d when people do other things while \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d written by Francis Scott Key, is played at football games. (For the record, he is a New England Patriots fan. \u201cBig time,\u201d he said.)After the November election, he has planned another focus for the 2016 Committee, including a name change. It will become the Stars and Stripes Forever Super PAC, he said.\u201cWhat that is going to do is identify conservative minorities to run for Senate seats,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Republican Party doesn\u2019t become more inclusive, and if the Republican Party doesn\u2019t get more minorities involved at senior levels of government, it will be over for the Republican Party.\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cIt may be over anyway.\u201dFor years, Mr. Sousa has urged the Navy to name a warship after his great-grandfather (the S.S. John Philip Sousa, a cargo ship built during World War II, was sold after the war and scrapped in the 1960s). After the announcement about Mr. Levin, Mr. Sousa wrote that nearly 200 Medal of Honor recipients from the Navy and the Marine Corps had been passed over. Mr. Sousa also wrote that the choice ignored Navy guidelines and tradition.\u201cThis liberal military-hating military has got to go,\u201d he added in the post. Then, referring to Mrs. Clinton by her initials, he added, \u201cAnd if there is any doubt in your mind, H.R.C. will do the same types of un-American things.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s legal immigration and illegal immigration,\u201d he said, noting that his great-great-grandparents had entered the country legally. \u201cI\u2019m all for limited legal immigration.\u201d He said that Mr. Arpaio was merely enforcing existing immigration laws. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make up his own laws,\u201d Mr. Sousa said, adding that he liked Mr. Carson\u2019s immigration plan, which would have let undocumented immigrants register as guest workers and pay any back taxes they might have owed (with penalties). They could have then applied for citizenship, but would not have received preferential treatment.But back to how he discovered Mr. Carson. He said that in summer 2013, he and three or four friends were talking about setting up a super PAC for congressional races.Mr. Sousa and his friends considered a campaign to draft Mr. Carson to run for a Senate seat in Maryland. \u201cMy instinct told me he wouldn\u2019t be interested,\u201d Mr. Sousa said, so they decided to see about a run for president. He contacted a friend who handles direct mail fund-raising.\u201cHe said, \u2018Be prepared to lose money and write me a check,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sousa recalled.The committee sent out 350,000 letters. \u201cWe netted $7 on every piece we sent out,\u201d Mr. Sousa said. \u201cThe average was around $40.\u201d And all for someone Mr. Sousa had never met.Before long, Mr. Carson appeared on Fox News and said he would not stand in the way of the draft committee. \u201cWe took that as a tremendous green light,\u201d Mr. Sousa said. \u201cHe could have just as easily said, \u2018I\u2019m aware of this, and my attorneys are sending him a cease-and-desist order.\u2019\u201dEventually, they met. \u201cFor about 90 seconds,\u201d Mr. Sousa said, and they did not talk politics. \u201cI gave him a copy of my book about my great-grandfather. He shook my hand and said, \u2018Thanks very much.\u2019\u201d Mr. Sousa went on to write another book, \u201cBen Carson: Rx for America.\u201d (\u201cI didn\u2019t take a dime for that,\u201d he said.)The draft-Carson committee focused on states with early nominating processes, such as Iowa and South Carolina. \u201cThe campaign management team Dr. Carson started with did a great job in the beginning, but it needed fresh blood \u2014 which it eventually got, but it was a day late and a dollar short,\u201d Mr. Sousa said. \u201cAnd then he finally got out of the race and hooked up with Trump.\u201dSo what about Mr. Trump? \u201cI think he is substantially better than Hillary,\u201d he said.That sounded lukewarm.\u201cThere are pieces of Donald Trump that I am very excited about, and there are pieces of Donald Trump that make me very nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m unique in that aspect.\u201d Mr. Sousa said he liked \u201cthe fact that he is not a politician, he\u2019s not polished, he\u2019s not smooth, he\u2019s not slick, he doesn\u2019t have the Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz answers.

But the team of music and technology executives behind her is betting that, based on her budding popularity online, she could soon be enjoying a screamfest of her own.Ms. Knox is one of the stars of YouNow, a live-streaming mobile app on which she broadcasts a few times a week, usually from her bedroom. She plays quirky cover tunes, along with earnest songs she\u2019s written herself, all the while interacting with her 80,000 followers. Her popularity on the app helped her land a record deal and a tour, and now Ms. Knox is poised to become the live-streaming world\u2019s first crossover music star.\u201cThere\u2019s social media fame, and then there\u2019s Justin Bieber fame,\u201d Ms. Knox said at VidCon. \u201cI\u2019d love to break out the way Justin Bieber has, through his YouTube to where he is now. That would be cool.\u201dPop stars were once crowned on \u201cAmerican Bandstand\u201d and MTV, but in the YouTube era the connection to fans has been much more personal. The newest talent incubators are apps like YouNow, Musical.ly, Flipagram, Snapchat and Vine, which satisfy millennials\u2019 preference for rapid-fire interactivity.\u201cThis is the new farm club,\u201d said David Hyman, a longtime digital music executive whose latest enterprise, Chosen, is a talent-contest app.Increasingly, the apps are also live, giving users a sense of taking part in something immediate, and creating a new class of performance stars on Facebook Live, YouNow and Twitter\u2019s Periscope app who may make music, dance or simply chat.Their clientele is very young. On YouNow, where the broadcast streams are festooned with emoji and comments, 74 percent of the users are between 13 and 24, according to the company. Musical.ly, which has bite-size videos of teenagers lip-syncing to pop hits, said it has 90 million users, and Flipagram, which attaches soundtracks to slide shows, said it has 200 million.\u201cThis generation was born with screens all around them,\u201d said Adi Sideman, the founder and chief executive of YouNow, which said it streams 50 years\u2019 worth of video each month. \u201cPerforming live, and being live, is completely natural to them.\u201dYouNow also lets performers make money from virtual gifts from fans; one performer, Brent Morgan, a 28-year-old from Alabama, said he makes $10,000 a month from these tips.At VidCon\u2019s panel discussions, social media stars spoke openly about making money from advertising and brand endorsements. But the value of those deals \u2014 and the return on investment for sponsors \u2014 can be murky, said Jocelyn Johnson, the founder of VideoInk, a trade publication covering the online video business.\u201cThere\u2019s a perception among brands that all of a star\u2019s audience will migrate from their YouTube channel or Instagram feed,\u201d Ms. Johnson said, \u201cbut what we are seeing is that those numbers don\u2019t always meet expectations.\u201dMs. Knox\u2019s label, S-Curve Records, wants to position her as a credible singer-songwriter whose experience as a live streamer can prepare her for wider audiences.Petite but with a snarky edge, Ms. Knox began playing guitar when she was 7. By age 12, her YouTube videos had attracted two experienced producers, Mike Mangini and Peter Zizzo, who have worked with artists like Avril Lavigne and Joss Stone.They decided then that she was too young, but a couple of years ago \u2014 just as she was beginning to use YouNow \u2014 they reconnected with Ms. Knox and began bringing her to New York for regular writing and recording sessions. With her parents\u2019 blessing, Ms. Knox left school during her senior year and is finishing her course work online to focus on her music career. At VidCon, her entourage included her mother and father, a police officer whose job at the conference was carrying his daughter\u2019s guitar, and her younger sister, Samantha.She has learned that singing viewers\u2019 names as they watch her helps keep her play counts high, but that what works best is simply \u201cbeing yourself.\u201d\u201cShowing my goofy personality,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can relate to that.\u201dA year ago Ms. Knox signed with S-Curve, whose founder, Steve Greenberg, has worked with acts like Hanson, Ms. Stone and, most recently, Andy Grammer. Mr. Greenberg described YouNow as an accelerated way for an artist to develop the skills of performance and crowd interaction.\u201cIn the old days, an artist would have to find some club to get good about relating to an audience,\u201d he said. \u201cWith YouNow she can just go online and play, whether it\u2019s for hundreds or thousands of people, and get real-time feedback.\u201dMs. Knox\u2019s career so far has been a mix of do-it-yourself online promotion and connections in the traditional music business. Her manager, Darin Harmon, used to work with Coldplay, and she secured a slot this fall opening for Charlie Puth, known as the guest singer on one of last year\u2019s biggest hits, Wiz Khalifa\u2019s \u201cSee You Again.\u201dYet Ms. Knox has also rejected parts of the Hollywood machine. She was approached to be a contestant on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d but turned them all down, favoring YouNow and the freedom to sign with a label of her choosing, according to her mother, Jamie.At VidCon, Ms. Knox shuttled between performances, promotional appearances and impromptu broadcasts at YouNow\u2019s dedicated booth, but she seemed most excited about meeting other young live-streamers, most of whom she had developed extensive online relationships with.\u201cIt\u2019s funny seeing faces that I\u2019ve seen before all over the internet,\u201d she said.At the YouNow booth, while Ms. Knox performed on a couch with two new friends, Nick Bean, a 21-year-old who is part of 5quad, a performance group made up of YouNow heartthrobs, described the importance of the app to his growing business portfolio, including an app of his own that he said he was on his way to San Francisco to pitch to tech investors.\u201cWhen I\u2019m live, I\u2019m relevant,\u201d Mr. Bean said.Given all that, is simply releasing an album a little, well, old-fashioned?\u201cNot really,\u201d Ms. Knox said. \u201cThey\u2019re all just ways of promoting yourself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Little of its market is actually in Britain, so it won\u2019t be affected if the United Kingdom has a recession. It doesn\u2019t have higher raw materials cost, something affecting other British companies as the pound fell after the decision to exit from the European Union. The company is well run and doesn\u2019t need fixing.That does make ARM something of a special case. But with the pound down and the dollar and the yen up after the so-called Brexit, it\u2019s almost certain that plenty of bankers working for tech companies are looking to buy. And there are more British assets that could go to foreign hands.If the issue is tech companies that don\u2019t rely on the British economy, there is also Inmarsat, a 37-year-old operator of a global satellite communications network. Its customers are global. ARM\u2019s future, and one reason SoftBank bought ARM, is the growth prospects of the sensor-rich internet of things. Satellite communications, and the communications spectrum that Inmarsat has, also look strong.Perhaps the greatest British tech assets are big phone companies like BT Group or Vodafone, which both operate across scores of countries. Those would be enormous acquisitions, of course; at a dinner with AT&T executives last week, I was told that the telecommunications firm, one of the few that could afford such an acquisition, is not interested.There are other British businesses with large foreign presences, like Shazam, the music service; SwiftKey, which uses artificial intelligence to make phone keyboards easier to use; or a number of companies in cloud computing. Of course, pretty much any company that lives primarily on the internet has no need to depend on a country\u2019s local market, and can easily move many of its assets to another location.There is one more British asset that can easily slip the British market: people with good tech skills. Those are not companies, but they have no problem taking their most valuable skills somewhere else.

{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer\u2019s Media Problem at Yahoo Is Now Verizon\u2019s to Solve", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byThere is no doubt that Yahoo made a valiant turnaround effort in recent years. Under the leadership of Marissa Mayer, the company made numerous attempts to improve its core business, with a steady run of acquisitions and investments in new apps and services.But one central aspect of Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategy \u2014 putting major money and attention into Yahoo\u2019s media properties, a wide range of news and entertainment publications and video projects \u2014 always seemed curious. And few people knew why this was a risky strategy better than Ms. Mayer herself. At Google, she had preached the coming challenges of making media on the web; at Yahoo, she lived them.In 2009, Ms. Mayer, then the executive at Google overseeing search products, was invited to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet. The subject: \u201cThe Future of Journalism.\u201d Her message: Fundamental changes are underway, and navigating them will not be easy for media companies.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.Because our mission is to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful, high-quality content is incredibly important to Google. Our most basic goal is to connect users with high-quality and reliable information. Credible, factual, trustworthy content \u2014 that is, journalism \u2014 is critical to the millions of users who search for news stories on Google.Over the years, media companies tailored articles and videos to game Google\u2019s opaque search algorithm. Google encouraged that, because it improved their search results. It also helped drive traffic to news sites.But Ms. Mayer outlined a situation in which most websites were almost entirely replaced as distributors of information, by Google, or Google-like companies. This, she admitted, was a hardship for publishers:When producing an article for online news, the publisher must assume that a reader may be viewing this article on its own, independent of the rest of the publication. To make an article effective in a stand-alone setting requires providing sufficient context for first-time readers, while clearly calling out the latest information for those following a story over time. It also requires a different approach to monetization: Each individual article should be self-sustaining. These types of changes will require innovation and experimentation in how news is delivered online, and how advertising can support it.Even web media companies, she acknowledged, depended on their ability to capitalize on distribution \u2014 to be able to sell their sites, and their audiences, as publications. To concede a direct relationship with readers to Google, or another company like it, is to turn your product into someone else\u2019s inventory, and to risk accelerating any media company\u2019s nightmare: full commoditization.Now the internet has broken down the entire news package with articles read individually, reached from a blog or search engine, and abandoned if there is no good reason to hang around once the story is finished. It\u2019s what we have come to call internally the atomic unit of consumption.This distinctive terminology describing how internet users would get information was in equal parts prophetic and motivated. How Ms. Mayer and Mr. Schmidt described the power of major online platforms \u2014 the manner in which powerful engines like Google profoundly shape the web, and companies, around them \u2014 would have provided a useful way to think about the dominance of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter since.Ms. Mayer\u2019s more specific prescription for how the web of 2009 should develop to accommodate Google, on the other hand \u2014 by creating constantly updated and growing \u201cliving stories\u201d to replace articles and web pages \u2014 didn\u2019t quite come to pass, as search results were superseded by fast-moving social feeds for news and entertainment. Google now has plenty of competition as a major online media distributor. The \u201catomic unit\u201d she described remains just that.Ms. Mayer\u2019s media investments at Yahoo gave it some unique advantages compared with most media companies. Yahoo was, when Ms. Mayer took over, a marginal but large search engine itself, and its home page, driven by millions of email users, was able to direct viewers to articles, videos and other properties in the Yahoo ecosystem. It had invested heavily in advertising technology, developing into something between a platform and a home page. That it might have an edge over other websites, at least in its ability to make money from online media, holding its \u201catomic units\u201d together in some sort of coherent and therefore more lucrative whole, was still plausible.Nonetheless, according to Yahoo\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s public statements about the value of the acquisition, Yahoo\u2019s media operations were a crucial motivator for Verizon, which acquired AOL, a similarly threatened content and ad-tech empire, last year.In other words, Verizon, like Yahoo before it, thinks it can regain some control over media distribution. The logic is appealing but the path is unclear.It\u2019s true that as a mobile carrier and internet service provider, Verizon has its own advantages. As a wireless carrier, it knows a lot about where its users are, and what they do on their phones. As a smartphone vendor, it can assert itself over handset manufacturers, to some degree, to include extra apps and software on mobile phones.But how, exactly, Verizon plans to turn such abilities into lasting advantages, especially against the powerful and unified distribution systems of social platforms, is not clear. \u201cImagine the distribution challenges we will solve,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in her note, without elaboration.Again, the problem has been identified, but the solution remains to be seen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taser International Dominates the Police Body Camera Market", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byWhen Micah Johnson went on a deadly shooting rampage in Dallas last week, body cameras worn by police officers were rolling, capturing at least 170 hours of video of the mayhem.That footage is now stored on a sophisticated cloud computing system that lets police manage digital evidence and hosts more hours of video than Netflix has available to stream.These paired offerings \u2014 body cameras for police and cloud storage \u2014 have transformed policing in recent years, adding a new level of transparency and accountability but also raising questions about privacy and who has the right to view those videos.Behind the scenes, one company is at the center of it all: Taser International. Best known for making Taser stun guns, it controls about three-quarters of the body camera business in the United States.Until recently a one-note provider of electrical weapons, Taser has swiftly cornered the market for body cameras and related software, making it one of the most important suppliers of technology to law enforcement today.Its Axon body cameras are worn by officers in dozens of big cities including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Washington and, yes, Dallas. And using computing power from Microsoft and Amazon, Taser runs Evidence.com, the site that lets police host and manage body camera video.Demand for the products has soared in the two years since Michael Brown was shot dead by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., and analysts now estimate that the market will soon be worth $1 billion a year.\u201cWhen the rest of us are snapping pictures and videos, police can\u2019t pull out a note pad and start writing,\u201d said Patrick W. Smith, the chief executive of Taser. \u201cThere\u2019s now an expectation from society that they\u2019re getting good documentation of what they\u2019re involved in. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to know what happened.\u201dMr. Smith and his brother, Thomas, founded Taser in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1993, and the company now is worth about $1.3 billion. Taser cameras have captured thousands of altercations between the police and the public and several controversial police shootings, including ones in Albuquerque and Cincinnati.Yet as Taser works to sell cameras and software to more departments, it is coming under fire for questionable business practices. In some instances, it has paid police chiefs to travel to Taser conferences. In other cases, chiefs who have bought Taser products have joined the company as consultants shortly after leaving public service. And several cities have awarded contracts to Taser without competitive bidding.So far, these issues have done little to blunt Taser\u2019s momentum. Last quarter, for the first time, Taser booked more sales for body cameras and related software than it did for its stun guns.Interest in body cameras was already picking up two years ago, as police departments around the country started responding to calls for greater accountability. Then, in August 2014, a white police officer killed Mr. Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson. The officer was not wearing a body camera, and witnesses disputed his account of the altercation that led to the shooting. The officer was not charged, and critics said that had he been wearing a body camera, the outcome might have been different.At times, the video can exonerate officers. In 2009, shortly after Taser began selling its cameras through its Axon division, Sgt. Brandon Davis shot and killed a man in Fort Smith, Ark. Video recorded by his body camera captured the shooting, and Mr. Davis was cleared of wrongdoing.In other instances, the footage can portray police as needlessly aggressive. In 2014, a Taser Axon camera worn by an officer in Albuquerque captured the fatal shooting of a homeless man by officers who did not appear to be threatened. The two officers have been charged with second-degree murder and are expected to stand trial soon.Even when body cameras are worn, they are not always effective. When two police officers fatally shot Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., on July 5, they were wearing body cameras made by a Taser competitor. A police spokesman said the cameras became dislodged during the altercation with Mr. Sterling, and the video was unlikely to reveal much; Baton Rouge is making a transition to Taser cameras.In another incident last week, the officer who killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn., was not wearing a body camera. But Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live.\u201cThe whole world wants to know what the heck happened in the moments leading up to that shooting,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Taser. \u201cWould a body camera have changed the behavior? Maybe. But it sure would have answered some questions.\u201dJust a few years ago, many police were reluctant to wear body cameras, fearing that their every action would be scrutinized.\u201cThere was a real hesitation at first,\u201d said Officer Jeff Garwacki, who oversees the body camera program at the Fort Worth Police Department.But as the devices have become more common, many police officers have come to rely on them. In Fort Worth, which has bought 800 body cameras from Taser and uses its Evidence.com service, Mr. Garwacki said most officers wanted to wear cameras at all times. \u201cThe body cameras are showing that the officers are doing what they say they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen police use body cameras and tell people that they are using them, it tends to produce better behavior by both the police and the public,\u201d said Chad Marlow, advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.Yet Mr. Marlow expressed concern that Taser had achieved such dominance in the body camera industry so quickly.\u201cThe fact that a lot of police departments are familiar with Taser has created an inclination to go with them,\u201d said Mr. Marlow. \u201cOther companies are not getting the opportunity to show off their products.\u201dSome of Taser\u2019s rivals, Mr. Marlow said, were developing software that made it easier to redact identifying features of people captured on camera, better protecting their privacy.There is no doubt that Taser has managed to use its longstanding relationships with police departments, which have used the company\u2019s stun guns for decades, to gain its early lead in the market for body cameras and related software.But several competitors, and some city officials, accuse the company of cozying up to police chiefs to secure lucrative contracts. Nearly all of the roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States have bought Taser\u2019s stun guns. \u201cTaser is very much intertwined with police departments,\u201d said Mark Strouse, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.In several instances around the country, Taser has either paid for the travel of police chiefs who went on to award the company contracts, or hired recently retired chiefs who had awarded Taser contracts.\u201cWe think there\u2019s an ongoing pattern of police chiefs getting lucrative consulting contracts after they retire, if they give Taser contracts,\u201d said Robert McKeeman, chief executive of Utility, which makes a rival body camera.Taser defended its sales tactics, saying they were commonplace, and said that many police departments were familiar with the company. It now makes law enforcement officials wait a year after leaving government service before it will hire them as consultants. Taser also said that while it was sometimes awarded sole-source bids, the departments doing the purchasing have often run a competitive process to test other cameras.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to solve customers\u2019 needs, you have to have close relationships,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything that was misleading.\u201dThe company struggled for several years. Ill-fated brand extensions like the Auto Taser, a device that electrified steering wheels to prevent car theft, nearly bankrupted the company.But sales picked up when Taser introduced a powerful electrical weapon, the M26, which resembled a handgun. Taser went public in 2001.The company began selling video recorders that worked with Taser weapons in 2006, and it introduced its first body camera, the Axon Pro, in 2009.Mr. Smith predicted that sales of Axon cameras and Evidence.com would soon dwarf sales of Taser\u2019s weapons, and that the company would one day be renamed to reflect the growing prominence of its body camera business.\u201cWe had a very successful business selling Taser weapons,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "I was born and raised in Sheffield, an English city where the recent referendum reflected the nation: a narrow 51 percent majority voted for Britain to leave the European Union. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emblematic of Britain in other ways, too. Part of the city is leafy, educated, liberal and dynamic. That is not where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m from. I was raised in the hinterlands, where only 9 percent of the population holds university degrees and 81 percent of the inhabitants voted to leave the E.U. Over the last 10 years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been documenting my home, and it is only now that I realize what the photographs represent: white, working-class landscapes that have remained politically invisible for too long.At school it was as though we had been deliberately miseducated to become underlings, set on a conveyor belt churning out factory workers, and the only work experience I was ever assigned, when I was 14, was two months in a retail store warehouse. After quitting college \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a cat-in-hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chance of passing this course, John\u00e2\u0080\u009d were the verbatim words of my biology tutor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I spent a couple of years \u00e2\u0080\u009cdossing around,\u00e2\u0080\u009d working a dead-end, part-time job as a stockroom assistant in a department store. I was lost, low on confidence and, to quote Paul Theroux \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who noticed similar traits in the 1980s among Belfast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cdying of indifference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a dosser, especially one with no money, you inhabit strange spaces, times and atmospheres; the quiet of a midweek afternoon is your desolate playground, and what else was there to do but wake up late, watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cMurder, She Wrote\u00e2\u0080\u009d reruns on daytime TV and go for long walks? These strolls were often sluggish and guilt-ridden, whole days spent wandering foggy-eyed and groggy-minded. Sometimes I browsed the local pawnshop, the type you find in poor neighborhoods, filled with the backwash of broken dreams: musical instruments, how-to books, travel narratives, ab-rollers and cameras. There was a Nikon film SLR, and I bought it out of laziness. That was another symptom of my predicament; I was broke but bored, so whenever I had a bit of money I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d spend it on something stupid that embodied the idea of escape. One week it was an Akai MPC, when I imagined I was going to be a music producer. The next it was graphic imaging software, as if I were going to be a designer. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been trained by school to think of these things as being a million miles from what I might reasonably expect as a career, so I never pursued them with any real hope.  Perhaps it was an anticipatory allegory of Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working-class \u201cBrexit\u201d vote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bored, invisible, jilted, what have we got to lose? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do something and see what happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost of these objects gathered dust, sold a month or two later for much less than I paid. But the camera stuck, because it gave a bit of structure and meaning to my day, and the developed film was evidence that I existed. People like me were nowhere to be seen on television or in travel guides, in the usual images Britain exported to the rest of the world.While I want to make it very clear that it is easier to be a white person in Britain than it is to be black, in my case I feel my blackness saved me. My Dad was an African American musician and actor, so my life in Sheffield was pierced with memories of being a younger child exposed to some travel, art and culture. Hip-hop and the words of Malcolm X stirred me into movement, and I reimagined my struggle as The Struggle, with obvious issues that I had to navigate, that could explain my pain. And as somebody with brown skin, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to reach the same easy (if ignorant) conclusions about my crummy life that my white friends could. There was no comfort for me in simplifying British identity. It could never be us and them because, as a black Briton, I was both at the same time, so didn\u2019t have the same crushing sense of entitlement my white friends had, nor the urge to blame other cultures for what was really the result of corporate exploitation and government cynicism about immigration.I now live in London, where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked as a writer, photographer and broadcaster for 10 years, but it is the lost period of my life that continually haunts my work. Over the last decade, in between various projects and commissions, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve returned to my corner of Sheffield, which remains as neglected as ever. But now I have the confidence to call myself a fl\u00c3\u00a2neur, rather than a dosser. After all, what did a young Henri Cartier-Bresson do in the 1930s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or William Eggleston in the 1970s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but idly wander the streets without an itinerary, taking photographs when it struck him?  These are lost landscapes largely populated by a demonized people who have found a voice in all of this Brexit chaos. When did you last see places like Sheffield, Sunderland or Romford mentioned in England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national narrative? The warning signs were always there, but nobody was looking. Although it may have been the wrong decision for all of us, it is largely a frustrated, vengeful, white, working-class Britain that has been ignored for too long, finally being shaken from its indifferent slumber."}

Bratton.\u201cOur interest is in staying out of the politics of the moment, not to provide photo-ops,\u201d Mr. Bratton said during a news conference at Police Headquarters in Manhattan.A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Jason Miller, said neither the candidate nor anyone from the campaign had requested a roll call appearance.The attack on Thursday has now added urgency for both candidates and their parties to address racial divisions in the country while showing support for its law enforcement officials.Mrs. Clinton made criminal justice reform and improving relations between police forces and black communities central to her Democratic primary campaign, calling for an end to the \u201cera of mass incarceration.\u201d She often appeared at campaign events with the mothers of black men killed in clashes with the police.Appearing alongside Mr. Biden would have complicated that message.The vice president enjoys a close bond with police officers, but he also played a central role in enacting the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. That legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, put more police officers on the streets, built dozens of new prisons and created tougher penalties for drug offenders. It has been widely criticized as having an adverse impact on black communities and the high levels of incarceration, arrests and police presence that have contributed to the current tensions.Five officers were killed and seven others were shot during a protest in downtown Dallas.Mrs. Clinton has not put as much emphasis on the issue of criminal justice in the general election campaign. That approach is expected to change after the deaths of Mr. Castile and Mr. Sterling and the killings in Dallas.If Mr. Trump intended to project a measured reaction to the shootings, his campaign\u2019s state chairman in Virginia, Corey Stewart, went sharply in a different direction.\u201cLiberal politicians who label police as racists \u2014 specifically Hillary Clinton and Virginia Lt. Governor Ralph Northam \u2014 are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight,\u201d Mr. Stewart wrote in a post that he later deleted.Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said, \u201cCorey does not speak for the campaign, and this is not something we agree with.\u201dReporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Nicholas Corasaniti, Matt Flegenheimer and J.

Kramer\u2019s patients are far luckier than most to receive psychotherapy, because the insurance industry provides reimbursements for medical treatments but only minimal support for psychotherapy. Drugs can ameliorate painful symptoms but do not address the capacity to engage in meaningful social relationships involving both love and work.

RICHMANCHICAGOThe writer is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\u2b25To the Editor:In \u201cListening to Prozac,\u201d Peter Kramer oversold the salutary effects of the new category of antidepressants, but this in no way should obscure his calling attention to its significance in the treatment of moderate to severe depression in adults. As a clinician trained in psychiatry and psychoanalysis, I value the use of psychotherapy in the treatment of many depressed patients. However, as any experienced therapist will confirm, there is a point in any psychotherapy when the inclusion of an effective antidepressant is essential if the patient is to be prevented from becoming chronically and intractably depressed.When non-psychiatric physicians like Marcia Angell attack Big Pharma for producing effective antidepressants because of their paranoid view of the profit motive in manufacturing, or journalists insist they are no better than a placebo, they are endangering many patients who may resist taking these important drugs on the basis of their destructive assertions. Peter Kramer\u2019s new book is a welcome corrective to irrational and paranoid responses of critics who simply don\u2019t treat and take responsibility for the well-being of depressed patients.HENRY J.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Leaves Shareholders With Little Say", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorYahoo\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon is a complicated beast, showing how different acquisition structures can affect how shareholders are treated.First, let\u2019s say what the Yahoo sale is not. It is not a sale of the publicly traded company. Instead, it is a sale of the Yahoo subsidiary and some related assets to Verizon.Because it is a sale of a subsidiary, the $4.8 billion will be paid to Yahoo. Its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend (after paying taxes). Instead, Yahoo shareholders will be left holding shares in the renamed company.As for Remain Co., it will become a so-called investment company. This is a special designation for a company that holds securities for investment but does not operate a working business. Investment companies are subject to special regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Remain Co. will probably just sit there, returning cash to shareholders and waiting for Alibaba to buy it in a tax-free transaction. (Alibaba says it has no plans to do this, but most people do not believe this).The rights of Yahoo shareholders in this sale will be different from those in an ordinary sale, when an entire company is bought.In either case, shareholders get a say. They either vote on the merger or decide whether to tender into the offer.The Yahoo deal, however, is not a sale of the public company. It is an asset sale, in which there is only a shareholder vote if there is a sale of \u201call\u201d or \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the assets of the company. Yahoo is not all of the assets or even \u201csubstantially all\u201d \u2013 the Alibaba shares being left behind in Remain Co. are worth about $28 billion, or six times the value of the cash Verizon is paying for the Yahoo assets it is buying.There will be no appraisal rights, however. Again, in an asset sale, there are no appraisal rights. So anyone who votes against the deal and thinks this is a bum price is out of luck.The different standards for voting and appraisal rights apply because the structure of the deal is a quirk of the law in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, that allows lawyers to sometimes work around these issues simply by changing the way a deal is done.In Yahoo\u2019s case, this is not deliberate, though. It is simply the most expedient way to get rid of the assets.Finally, if another bidder still wants to acquire Yahoo, it has time. The agreement with Verizon allows Yahoo to terminate the deal and accept a superior offer by paying a $144 million breakup fee to Verizon. And if Yahoo shareholders change their minds and want to stick with Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, and vote down the deal, there is a so-called naked no-vote termination fee of $15 million payable to Verizon to reimburse expenses.All in all, this was as hairy a deal as they come. There was the procedural and logistical complications of selling a company when the chief executive wanted to stay. Then there was the fact that this was an asset sale, including all of the challenges that go with it. Throw in all of the tax issues and the fact that this is a public company, and it is likely that the lawyers involved will have nightmares for years to come.Advertisement"}

Giles Limited, features some 50 images from the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing collection of more than 20,000 photographs. These pictures resonate with the joy, contentment, resistance, determination, dissent and the routines of everyday life: a photograph by Jason Miccolo Johnson of boys and girls singing in the choir of Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington (Slide 3); a pensive photograph by George Krause of a child sitting alone in a church pew (below); and James Karales\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image of a young demonstrator, waving an American flag at the Alabama march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 (Slide 4).Through images and words by photographers and writers, black and white, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPicturing Children\u00e2\u0080\u009d challenges the stereotype of the broken black family and examines the family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial role \u00e2\u0080\u009cin shaping who we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Images of the famous or the disenfranchised \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Nina Leen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photograph of the pioneering baseball player Jackie Robinson with his wife and son (below), or James E.

Starting in the 19th century, black-owned photo studios allowed African-Americans to represent themselves as they wanted to be seen, and the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s section on portraiture reflects that revered status. The studio was especially important for children, who endured withering attacks on their self-worth by stereotypical depictions. A study in the 1940s by an African-American psychologist, Dr. Kenneth Clark, demonstrated the fragility of black children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-image when he showed black grade schoolers photographs of black and white dolls, identical in every way except for skin color. A majority of them chose the white doll as the one they would \u00e2\u0080\u009clike to play with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d considering the white doll \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the black doll \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No wonder portraits, and the very act of being photographed, played an important role in bolstering the self-confidence of black children in a culture awash with grotesque caricatures.The book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final chapter looks at how African-American children empowered themselves through political activism. Pictures include Gertrude Samuels\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photograph of a meeting of teenage members of the Little Rock Nine, who tried to integrate Central High School in the Arkansas city in 1957 against ferocious opposition from white supremacists, and Devin Allen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemporary image of a young girl holding a Black Lives Matter sign at a Baltimore rally in 2015 (Slide 5). Children have long played an important role in the struggle for civil rights. The 1963 images from the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Crusade in Birmingham, Ala., vividly demonstrated to a national audience the depravity and cruelty of the police and opponents of civil rights who attacked youths engaged in nonviolent protest. Stark photographs of them being attacked by dogs and knocked to the ground by water cannon shifted public opinion in their favor, persuading long-skeptical white Americans of the inherent indecency of segregation and its peril to democracy.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPicturing Children\u00e2\u0080\u009d also makes clear that African-American children have not been any less nurtured than those of other ethnic and racial groups. Indeed, the reality of racism and the potential for discrimination have made caring for and educating black children even more vital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfrican American adults have long done their very best to protect their children from a society that does not always value them highly and to remind them that, no matter what the outside world says, they have dignity and sacred worth that no outside force can touch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Marian Wright Edelman, the founder and president of the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defense Fund, in one of the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essays. She also offers a reminder that despite significant gains and the election of our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first black president, considerable work remains: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA toxic cocktail \u00e2\u0080\u0094 poverty, resegregation, unequal schools, massive illiteracy and innumeracy, racial disparity in every child-serving system, violence, and a pipeline to prison that feeds a mass incarceration system \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is sentencing millions of children of color to dead-end, powerless, and hopeless lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is in this context that photography, as current events confirm, has become even more important for African-American communities, both as a means of documenting these problems and as a catalyst for hope and change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that children are the only real Progress, the sole Hope, the sure victory over Evil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the seminal black intellectual and activist W.E.B.

{"Headline": "Chris Froome Keeps Lead on a Somber Day at the Tour de France", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byVALLON-PONT-D\u2019ARC, France \u2014 Booming loudspeakers often give the start area of the Tour de France the aura of a disco, one that inexplicably opens for business at midmorning. On Friday in Bourg-St.-And\u00e9ol, however, even the Tour announcer abandoned his exuberance for a somber tone.Chris Froome, who maintained his hold on the race leader\u2019s yellow jersey in Friday\u2019s time trial, is one of several riders who live close to Nice, in Monaco.\u201cI do a lot of training on those roads,\u201d Froome said after Friday\u2019s stage and after declining to answer questions about the race itself. \u201cJust to see the promenade the way it was yesterday evening \u2014 bodies all over the road \u2014 is really, really horrific.\u201dFriday\u2019s time trial of 40 kilometers, or about 25 miles, which dipped in and out of a deep and scenic gorge, almost did not take place. Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour, said that in the hours after the attack, the organization had considered canceling the stage.But after meeting with regional government officials and with law enforcement and intelligence agencies, he said in a statement, the Tour\u2019s organizers had decided to go ahead.\u201cWe wondered about having a race today or not,\u201d Prudhomme said in the statement. \u201cBut in agreement with the state authorities, we believe that the race must go on and we shouldn\u2019t give in to the pressure of the people who would like us to change our lifestyle.\u201dWhile the decision did not attract criticism from within the race, some riders expressed unease about being a part of an event that may be impossible to secure from a similar attack.Whether security was further increased was unclear. There was no obvious increase in the number of police officers along Friday\u2019s route, where the air was frequently filled with the scent of lavender fields. But roads used by the Tour have always been lined with gendarmes, and large numbers of riot police officers are often stationed in the side streets of urban centers. Crowds are salted with plainclothes police officers, who sometimes reveal themselves when petty crimes occur.Additional security measures, like increased bag inspections near race sites, were introduced this year.Moments of silence were held before the first rider started and after the last rider, Froome, finished his individual race against the clock. Along the route, spectators held signs honoring the victims of the carnage. \u201cPray for Nice,\u201d read one.For the third consecutive day, the race was buffeted by high winds, and digital signs in villages near the course flashed wind warnings to residents. Trading aerodynamics for control, particularly in the crosswinds, several riders avoided the solid-disc rear wheels that have become standard equipment in time trials.Tom Dumoulin, a Dutch rider who unexpectedly edged Froome to win the stage, said that at one point the wind had suddenly pushed him from the right side to the left side of a section of road.\u201cIt was windy; it was dangerous all the time,\u201d he said, noting in particular a descent where he and Froome were clocked at more than 110 kilometers an hour, or about 68 m.p.h.Dumoulin, who rides for the Giant-Alpecin team, finished 1 minute 3 seconds ahead of Froome on Friday, his second stage win of this year\u2019s Tour. But even with those performances, he was 40th over all at the end of the day, an insurmountable 56:18 behind Froome.As expected, the time trial sorted out Froome\u2019s relationship to his rivals for the overall lead. Bauke Mollema of the American Trek-Segafredo team, who had tumbled to the road with Froome in the fan-induced crash that brought chaos to the Tour on Thursday, is now second over all, 1:47 back. Adam Yates, a young British rider who was supposed to be here just for the experience, put in a good enough time trial to drop only to third from second, one place ahead of Nairo Quintana of Colombia.Tejay van Garderen of the United States, the co-leader of the BMC team, also put in a solid ride and sat at sixth over all, 3:19 behind Froome.Van Garderen, however, appeared disappointed.\u201cMy time trial was about average,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of the best ones I\u2019ve ever had, but the Tour de France is about consistency, so I\u2019ll just keep chipping away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg Expresses Regret for Criticizing Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s indignant dissents from the bench have turned her into a heroine of the left, beloved for methodically skewering her conservative colleagues. On the internet, she has become the Notorious R.B.G.\u201cJudges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office,\u201d she wrote in a brief statement issued by the court, admitting her remarks were \u201cill advised\u201d and expressing regret. \u201cIn the future I will be more circumspect.\u201dA revered figure at some of the nation\u2019s most elite law schools since her appointment to the court in 1993, Justice Ginsburg, 83, flabbergasted many in the legal community when she called Mr. Trump a \u201cfaker,\u201d and said she could not really imagine what it would be like if he became president.Barry Friedman, a professor of law at New York University who describes himself as a friend of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s, said her comments were a stark example of a breach in the neutrality that justices must adhere to.\u201cThe price you pay for being on the bench is that you withdraw from politics,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cYou need to be extremely circumspect.\u201dMark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard, said Justice Ginsburg\u2019s comments reflected the divisive nature of today\u2019s politics, which had already affected the legislative and executive branches of government.\u201cMaybe this is an example of how hyperpolarization affects the court,\u201d he said.In expressing her disdain for Mr. Trump, Justice Ginsburg was anything but circumspect, leading some to wonder whether, after 23 years at the court, she is looking toward a possible retirement after the presidential election.Shana Knizhnik, the co-author of a biography titled \u201cNotorious R.B.G.: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\u201d said the justice was well aware that her time on the bench would not last forever. But Ms. Knizhnik said she was still surprised by Justice Ginsburg\u2019s comments.\u201cShe has always said she is going to do this job as long as she can do it full steam,\u201d Ms. Knizhnik said on Thursday. \u201cBut from an actuarial standpoint, she sees that there aren\u2019t going to be too many more elections during her tenure.\u201dA legal advocate for most of her life, Justice Ginsburg made a name for herself when she represented the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in several landmark cases before the court on issues including gender discrimination, equal protection and due process.After serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for more than a dozen years, Justice Ginsburg was elevated to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the second woman to serve there. Though a stalwart of the court\u2019s liberal bloc, she was hardly a household name.But that started to change in the last decade, as conservatives on the court more aggressively asserted their philosophy and Justice Ginsburg began reading fiery dissents.Ms. Knizhnik said the internet offered a caricature that exaggerated the liberal philosophy of Justice Ginsburg, who had formed a close personal bond with Justice Antonin Scalia, the court\u2019s most outspoken conservative before his death this year.\u201cThe idea that she is this hyperpartisan is not true, even though certain people in political life paint her that way,\u201d Ms. Knizhnik said. \u201cShe is very much about disagreeing agreeably.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace to the court, and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw it.\u201dHe later called on Justice Ginsburg to resign, something she did not respond to in her statement.Legal scholars said they could not remember a time that a sitting justice expressed regret publicly for something he or she said, though many justices have been known to socialize with political figures or to privately express their political preferences, only to have them reported in the media.Justice Scalia went hunting with Dick Cheney, the former vice president, even as he participated in cases involving Mr. Cheney\u2019s activities in government. On the night in 2000 when news networks initially reported that Al Gore had won the presidential election, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was said to have told friends at a dinner party that it was terrible news.Mr. Tushnet said the idea of what was acceptable political activity for a Supreme Court justice had evolved over time. In the early 1900s, it was not uncommon, he said, for justices to openly express their desire to run for president. Charles Evans Hughes resigned his seat on the court in 1916 to run for the White House.But norms have changed, Mr. Tushnet said. Now, Americans expect the justices to keep their opinions largely to themselves.\u201cMy guess is that similar things occur today, but they are behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Tushnet said. \u201cWhat\u2019s different about this was that it was in front, on the record.\u201dMr. Friedman said Americans should not be na\u00efve by thinking that the justices do not have opinions. But he also criticized the current members of the court for being too willing to attend conferences with partisan leanings or too eager to grant interviews when they have a book to sell.\u201cThis comment comes as a part of the culture of the justices being public figures instead of paying greater attention to the black robes they wear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still their job to operate from a position of neutrality.\u201dAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly the year in which Justice Antonin Scalia apologized to reporters after a deputy federal marshal ordered them to destroy recordings of a half-hour speech by Justice Scalia at a Mississippi high school. It was 2004, not 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sister of French Soccer Star Antoine Griezmann Recalls Terror of Paris Attacks", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byMAC\u00d4N, France \u2014 Maud Griezmann walked into the concert hall and looked around. It was a little before 9 p.m. on Nov. 13 at the Bataclan in Paris, and she admired the grand stage. She looked at the growing crowd. She watched, for a few moments, as a man at the souvenir stand sorted T-shirts and posters and CDs for the band Eagles of Death Metal, which was just about to begin its set.Then Ms. Griezmann looked quickly at her phone. Her brother Antoine Griezmann is a star forward for France\u2019s national soccer team, and he was playing that night at the Stade de France, just outside the city limits. It was an exhibition match against Germany. The game and the concert were scheduled to start around the same time. Ms. Griezmann put her phone away. She wanted to listen to the music.Because of that, she did not see on Twitter or Facebook that her brother, like many of the other players in the game, was jolted by the unmistakable sound of an explosion outside the stadium about 9:20. She did not know that two suicide bombers had blown themselves up near the match. She did not know that associates of those terrorists had sprayed bullets at restaurants in downtown Paris. She did not know that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France had been taken away from the stadium in a helicopter amid fears that Paris was under siege.She only knew that, about 40 minutes after Eagles of Death Metal began to play \u2014 mostly rock, not heavy metal despite the band\u2019s name \u2014 a patter of loud pops could suddenly be heard over the music. It was not clear what has happening. \u201cAt first we thought it was a prank, a joke,\u201d Ms. Griezmann said Tuesday, speaking at length about her experience for the first time. \u201cWe thought it was part of the concert. But then we heard the screams.\u201dShe and her boyfriend, Simon Degoul, were pushed toward the front right corner of the room, by the edge of the stage, as three terrorists stormed into the hall with assault rifles and grenades. Ms. Griezmann and Mr. Degoul, like so many people around them, dropped to the ground in an attempt to avoid the bullets. A woman fell between them.The floor was hard against Ms. Griezmann\u2019s cheek. She pressed her face down, forcing herself to avoid looking at what was happening all around her. \u201cIf you moved, you were shot,\u201d she said. \u201cA person next to me moved, and they shot him. They just shot him, and I heard him land.\u201dShe does not remember any distinguishing characteristics about the woman next to her. Blond or brunette, tall or short \u2014 nothing. She does not know her name or how old she was. She only remembers the woman\u2019s hands. Ms. Griezmann held one of them; Mr. Degoul held the other. As the terrorists killed people on the mezzanine and in the concert pit below, Ms. Griezmann and Mr. Degoul and the woman buried their faces and shut their eyes and held their bodies as still as possible except for the tiniest movements of the hands they clasped.The movements traveled in a chain. Ms. Griezmann would begin with a squeeze to one hand, and the woman would pass the squeeze up the line to Mr. Degoul before he would send it back down toward Ms. Griezmann. They did this \u2014 squeeze after squeeze after squeeze \u2014 for 90 minutes. They did it in fear of what it would mean if the message they were sending each other stopped.\u201cIt was the only way we could tell each other we were still alive,\u201d Ms. Griezmann said.Ms. Griezmann smiles a lot. She is 28. She has hair that is dyed red, with small waves in it. She laughs and grins and talks animatedly about her family and her travels and her tattoos, which include Antoine Griezmann\u2019s date of birth; the name of her other brother, Theo; and, in a recent addition to the upper part of her right arm and still wrapped in protective plastic, a homage to the television show \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201dSitting at a cafe here in the center of the town where she and her brothers grew up, Ms. Griezmann became brusque only when it was suggested that this week might stir unique emotions for her or her family, particularly with France playing in a European Championships semifinal against Germany on Thursday night in Marseille. This will be the first time France has played Germany since the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people, about 90 at the Bataclan.\u201cIt is an important game for Antoine, for the team, for the fans,\u201d Ms. Griezmann said. \u201cBut it is not something other than that. I don\u2019t think about football with what happened. I try not to think about it at all.\u201dShe knows, though, that is impossible. In the eight months since the attacks, she has not seen a therapist, she said, adding that \u201cfamily and life is my therapy.\u201d She has talked about her experience at length with Antoine only once \u2014 about a week after the attacks in Madrid, where he lives and plays for Atl\u00e9tico \u2014 after which they both decided it was best to move on.But that does not mean Ms. Griezmann will not open up. To the contrary, once she begins to speak, the recollections come flowing out.Her memories of the night, like those of many people who have been involved in traumatic events, are a mix of necessarily hazy and glaringly sharp. She does not remember how many attackers there were or where they were standing or everything they shouted. She does remember, oddly, feeling more frightened when there were long periods of silence instead of the racket of gunfire. She remembers kicking off her shoes, Dr. Martens, so she could run faster. She remembers sprinting for the door when the police finally came in and seeing, so clearly, the man she had watched sorting items at the souvenir stand lying motionless on the ground.She remembers waiting in a courtyard about 200 yards from the Bataclan with other survivors while the police continued their operation. She remembers calling her mother from Mr. Degoul\u2019s cellphone and shouting, \u201cI\u2019m out! I\u2019m out!\u201d over and over because she couldn\u2019t think of what else to say. She remembers walking, 10 or 15 minutes in her bare feet at 2 a.m., to Place de la Republique, where she and Mr. Degoul found a taxi, only to have to plead with the driver to take them home.\u201cI had blood all over my clothes,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe was worried about his seats.\u201dIn January, about two months after the Paris attacks, Ms. Griezmann began working with Antoine as his publicity strategist. She has a degree in public relations, and as her brother\u2019s stardom grew because of his play with Atl\u00e9tico, which reached the Champions League final in May, and with the national team, she wanted to help guide him toward the right partners, the right relationships.She knows that some people say it is not a good idea to mix business and family, but she says she is not worried. She and Antoine have always been close and have always had a special relationship. Growing up here, in the Gautriats neighborhood of Mac\u00f4n, about an hour north of Lyon, she watched Antoine, who is three years younger, kick his soccer ball, over and over, against the blue garage door of their house.\u201cMy parents did not always like this,\u201d she said.She was Antoine\u2019s goalkeeper when he wanted to practice shooting, and she encouraged him when he grew frustrated about his slight build and his shorter-than-average height, an attribute that most acknowledge is the primary reason high-level French clubs were not interested in scouting him.Even now, as he has become a central cog in the French team at the Euros (he has scored 4 of the team\u2019s 11 goals), Ms. Griezmann still mostly thinks of him only as her little brother. When they visited New York a few years ago, just the two of them, they made a YouTube video of their giddy antics that featured encounters with Times Square\u2019s Naked Cowboy and Antoine dancing on his hotel bed.Although Ms. Griezmann lives in Paris and Antoine lives in Madrid, she still comes here quite often to visit her parents, who also are reveling in their son\u2019s rise. A longtime family friend, Patrick Montero, said about 3,000 residents of the town will wear Antoine Griezmann masks and jerseys when they watch Thursday\u2019s game at the city\u2019s exhibition center.\u201cIt is an amazing time for Antoine now,\u201d Ms. Griezmann said. \u201cIt is an amazing time for all of us.\u201dShe and her family will be at the game Thursday and, she added quickly, at the tournament final on Sunday, too, \u201csince France will win.\u201d That match is at the Stade de France, but she has no concerns about what going to a game there \u2014 or anywhere \u2014 might do to her psychologically.While French soccer and the attacks are, for many, still intertwined, Ms. Griezmann said she makes no connection between them. Most days, she said, are normal. She acknowledges what happened to her \u2014 she got a tattoo of the lead singer from the Eagles of Death Metal crying and hugging the Eiffel Tower \u2014 but is not shaken by overt confrontations with it.Rather, it is the subtle things that poke at her, the little moments that twist her stomach. Since she did not see much of what happened that night, it is actually sounds, not images, that shake her.Sudden shouts. Screams from out of nowhere. And, perhaps most of all, sounds of feet moving.A few weeks after the attacks, she was in the grocery store shopping when a little boy behind her in the aisle suddenly started to run in the other direction. He was chasing his mother, perhaps, or just doing what boys do, but Ms. Griezmann stopped short.\u201cI heard it \u2014 the running,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought people were being taken hostage in the store.\u201dShe paused.\u201cI don\u2019t know when that will stop,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will.\u201dBeno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Qandeel would be curled up in her own bed, in a low-cut number, cooing absurd, provocative sweet-nothings to the online millions of urban Pakistan.Her real name was Fauzia Azeem. She was a young divorc\u00e9e from a small Punjabi village. \u201cMy head is aching,\u201d she purred in one of her first posts, her lips parted, cleavage tumbling into the camera. \u201cThe pain is hurting.\u201d Her head may or may not have been hurting, but her performance was intended to garner attention. It did.The videos became bolder: Swaying in a bikini, she promised a striptease if Pakistan brought home a coveted cricket trophy.

Like everything she produced, the photos went viral, smashing, for a brief moment, society\u2019s notions of a mainstream religious figure: Here was a respectable cleric \u2014 a member of the moon-sighting committee, no less, which decides when Ramadan will begin and end \u2014 hanging out with the most trolled social media sensation in the country.Her brother confessed at a news conference that he had strangled her because her videos had brought shame on their family. The Pakistani news media called it an \u201chonor killing,\u201d even though she had neither run off with nor married a man against her parents\u2019 wishes (the usual reasons for such murders).Her \u201csin\u201d was simply being herself \u2014 a brave, bold, lusty, thigh-jangling, cricket-loving 26-year-old who had chosen the treacherous terrain of social media to interact with Pakistan\u2019s socially conservative, aspirational middle classes. Recently, she had begun talking in interviews about \u201cgirl power\u201d and the right to be her own person.According to media reports, Her parents were upstairs when she was strangled. Her father told the local news media that she had \u201csupported all of us, including my son who killed her.\u201d The police have arrested her brother and are investigating another brother, in addition to the mufti from the photographs, in connection with the killing.Many of those who were critical of (and titillated by) her videos became even angrier after her death: She deserved to die, they wrote on her Facebook page. Others expressed sorrow: She was an affront to Islam, but God, not man, should have been the one to punish her. She was not my cup of tea, many women said, but no one has the right to murder. I admired her for her courage, some said.Qandeel was anything but prudent, but I, too, admired her for being wholly and utterly herself. As an actor in Pakistan, I am familiar with the demands that women in the public eye cultivate images of ourselves that never fall foul of \u201crespectability.\u201d We walk the fine line between tolerable and taboo \u2014 between acceptance and ostracism, stardom and pariahhood, and sometimes between life and death. Qandeel shattered the mold, and she paid for it with her life.Qandeel, with her kohl-rimmed eyes and whispering sexual soliloquies, challenged the age-old hierarchies of modern-day Pakistan. In an interview recorded two days before her murder, a caller asked her why she didn\u2019t use her popularity to do something good for Pakistan. \u201cI would like to,\u201d she responded, \u201cbut there are a lot of issues in my life right now. I am in the middle of dealing with not one, not two, but three cases filed against me, I\u2019m dealing with controversies, and, then, my brothers want to kill me.\u201dIn a show of spectacular evasion, the caller and the host ignored the last bit, and the caller again insisted she do something good for Pakistan.Her brother, upon his arrest, said he had done the right thing to salvage his family\u2019s honor. Pakistan can now be proud of its many very good murderers.Mira Sethi, a former assistant books editor at The Wall Street Journal, is a writer and actor.Advertisement"}

But the Dollar Shave acquisition signals something bigger than a mere improvement in shaving \u2014 it also underscores a consumer products revolution that would not have been possible without technology.For you and me, this is a boon. By cutting out the inefficiencies of retail space and the marketing expense of TV, the new companies can offer better products at lower prices. We will get a wider range of products \u2014 if companies don\u2019t have to market a single brand to everyone on TV, they can create a variety of items aimed at blocs of consumers who were previously left behind. And because these companies were born online, where reputations live and die on word of mouth, they are likely to offer friendlier, more responsive customer service than their faceless offline counterparts.With Casper, you simply buy the mattress online and it\u2019s shipped to you in a comically small box (the compressed foam expands into a full-sized mattress, like a magic trick). You have three months to try it out, and if you don\u2019t like it, the company will come pick it up free.Casper\u2019s business model offers a break from the annoyance of offline mattress shopping. It also works out for the company. Casper advertises on social networks, on Google, podcasts and a variety of other places online; the ads are creative, convincing, targeted and cheap. By selling directly rather than through retail middlemen, the company also creates a connection with customers that allows it to test and develop new products \u2014 it now sells sheets and pillows, too.Value destruction could be on the table. But there\u2019s another view that new online brands could unlock profits through products aimed at people who are not well served by incumbents.Unlike Dollar Shave, Mr. Walker does not aim to compete with traditional consumer product companies on price alone. \u201cWe want to build a very profitable business,\u201d he said. He will do so, he said, by fostering a deep, lifelong connection with an audience that is getting wealthier and more influential \u2014 and whose influence, thanks to social networks, can now be tapped.\u201cGlobal culture is led by American culture, which is led by black culture in the U.S. \u2014 look at music, dance, et cetera,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re catering to an audience that are the most culturally influential demographic group in the world, we can use the internet to promulgate our message across the board, whether it\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram \u2014 and that gives us amazing leverage.\u201dWalker & Company declined to provide sales numbers; a spokesman said revenue had grown 300 percent over the last year.\u201cWe\u2019re offering a solution to busy parents that\u2019s just not out there in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Carbonell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about some new style every day, it\u2019s something you can count on.\u201dIt\u2019s striking how few of these online companies could have taken off in the presocial age. At the very least, they would have been sunk by the inability to target ads to the demographics they\u2019re aiming to serve.\u201cLook at Dollar Shave,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads and business platform, told me. \u201cThey were just trying to reach men.

(Translation: \u201cPut on the costume/the face in white powder/The people pay, and they want to laugh.\u201d)But on a Monday night in Koreatown in Manhattan, the Italian aria emanated from the Mexican manager of a Chinese restaurant, Alejandro Olmedo. Mr. Olmedo\u2019s bravura tenor often startles tourists on West 32nd Street, where he stands most nights outside the restaurant\u2019s doors, waving down diners.The lyrics from \u201cPagliacci\u201d are well suited to the special little restaurant on 32nd Street, whose name, Shanghai Mong, means \u201cdream\u201d in Chinese, and whose proprietors, Tora and Jane Yi, have battled back from loss and heartbreak to carve out a dream of their own. Theirs takes shape amid the chopsticks and fortune cookies as an only-in-New York fantasy that serves arias with a side of lo mein, while feeding budding contraltos and baritones weekly for a literal song.And Mr. Olmedo, the tenor, born in Acapulco, trained in Italy and renowned in Russia, is now grateful, he says, to be hawking stir-fry on the pavement.Soon, he became consumed with opera, and with the idea that his daughter, who goes by Nabi, should see her father as something more than \u201cjust a businessman,\u201d he said. He began hosting opera nights, as much to hear the music as to champion the singers. Ido became a veritable Cheers for the city\u2019s opera singers, whom Mr. Yi paid in sashimi to serenade the dining room.In truth, Mr. Yi was himself an aspiring singer but lacked the nerve to perform. Late at night at Ido, he would lock the doors and sing his heart out \u2014 to no one.Rising rent forced the Yis to shut Ido. It also set off a period of personal crisis for Mr. Yi. \u201cI worked 30 years straight,\u201d said Mr. Yi, who started as a teenager in an aunt\u2019s Brooklyn fish market. \u201cI wanted to find a reason for my life.\u201dHis most important work, he realized, was raising Nabi. After Ido\u2019s closing, he devoted his days to driving her to school, cheerleading practice and recitals, where she plays the gayageum, a Korean zither. He lived off savings, help from family and some sushi-making gigs. At night they would sing songs at home, played on Ido\u2019s old piano.He also spent time dreaming up a future while kayaking beneath the Throgs Neck Bridge in Whitestone, Queens, where they lived, the family\u2019s French poodle, Susan, perched in the prow. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to regret my life,\u201d Mr. Yi said.In January, he felt ready to venture into the restaurant world again. The family bought Shanghai Mong, a restaurant at 30 West 32nd Street, because of its high-traffic location \u2014 and auspicious name.But two weeks after opening, Jane Yi, whose given name is Young, received a call as she ran the dinner service in the new restaurant. Their home in Whitestone had burned down. Nearly everything was lost; Susan the poodle died in the blaze. In an alley beside Shanghai Mong, Mrs. Yi broke down in tears. Then she returned to the restaurant floor. \u201cI had to,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our dream.\u201dSeeing an artist laid so low, Mr. Yi said, was painful. \u201cThey deserve a little better,\u201d he said. He offered him the job of manager.On a Monday in June, Mr. Olmedo bellowed strains of \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d out onto 32nd Street, his robust vibrato echoing up the street as if it were a concert hall, in an effort to entice passers-by to Opera Night, a weekly tradition Mr. Yi has resurrected. Taxi drivers craned their heads from cab windows and smiled with each crescendo.Inside, nearly a dozen opera singers took turns performing at the back of the dining room. Sopranos filled the restaurant with arpeggios as customers nibbled dumplings, each singer sidestepping busboys with steaming platters. The performers were accompanied on the piano from the old West Village restaurant. It was one of the few items that survived the fire at their home. It still smells of smoke.And then, Mr. Yi himself stepped beside the piano. In perfect Italian, he began at last, to sing.His white chef\u2019s jacket could almost have been a tux and tails.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hillary Clinton\u2019s Nomination, Women See a Collective Step Up", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byThe president would know what it is like to be pregnant. Top military leaders would answer to a female boss, when there has never even been a woman on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Workplaces and home life could be transformed through expanded parental leave and pay equity. Or nothing could change. The symbolism would be supernova-level. The backlash could be withering.On Thursday night, 240 years into an unbroken chain of all-male leadership, Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president. The country may be one hard-fought election away from a woman in charge, making a question that has always been abstract more concrete: How could having a woman as president alter the experience of being an American woman?\u201cWomen will get fair wages,\u201d said Tammy Keith, 53, a caseworker who lives in East New York, Brooklyn, and estimated that she has been paid about $20,000 less than her male counterparts over the last 14 years.The more boldly Mrs. Clinton acted, the more empowered women would feel, said Marqui Wilcher, 25, a supervisor at a Pittsburgh call center and a single mother. \u201cDon\u2019t go in there and cower down,\u201d she said, as if speaking to the nominee.Milestones in politics when women and minorities were first elected to federal, state and local government.The election of the first woman to the White House could revitalize stalled issues of workplace equality, said Jeanne Crain, 56, the chief executive of a bank in St. Paul. \u201cI think there are ways for me as a leader here to use this as a springboard \u2014 shame on me \u2014 in ways I haven\u2019t done,\u201d she said.All week, cameras at the convention hall in Philadelphia have captured images of women weeping, hugging and cheering on Mrs. Clinton. Dozens of other women across the country, in interviews at their offices or alongside their children, also said they felt on the cusp of a major, collective step forward. A few said it would make no difference: \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s a woman, blah blah blah,\u201d said Kristin Shearer, 45, a Trump supporter in Cambridge, Mass.But most of the women interviewed \u2014 from their teens to their 90s, Democrats and Republicans, store clerks to executives \u2014 believed that a female presidency could somehow be a force in their own lives, even if they did not yet know how.Some female leaders of other countries, like Indira Gandhi in India and Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, accumulated power in sharp contrast to their countrywomen, who had very little. But if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, she would take office during a period of economic and demographic transformation for American women, who are outnumbering men in college enrollment by ever widening margins, becoming primary breadwinners and heading their own households.State-mandated parental leave is slowly coming into place for the first time in American history. As commander in chief, one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tasks would be to finish the integration of women into combat roles in the United States military.But historic expectations can also set up deep disappointments. In the interviews, many women expressed pent-up wishes born of a slow-to-change culture and hard-lived personal experience. If Mrs. Clinton is elected, those dreams may crash hard. Cracking an opening in a glass ceiling is not the same as dismantling it, said Marianne Cooper, a Stanford sociologist who was the lead researcher for Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book \u201cLean In.\u201d\u201cTo really shatter the glass ceiling would mean she was upending the forces that are barriers for women,\u201d she said. Those are \u201creally difficult for any single individual from an underrepresented group to undo,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd in four years?\u201d23 PhotosBut it is not yet entirely clear how a President Hillary Clinton might fund or enact some of her proposals. Congress is frozen, and politics requires compromises that often disappoint. American feminism is a raucous mishmash of pop culture heroines, reproductive rights advocates, anti-rape activists and others, glued together by little more than fervent online debate.And there are few unifying legacy organizations like the N.A.A.C.P., the Urban League or even new groups like Black Lives Matter to push her agenda. She could easily find herself in a position similar to that President Obama has faced on race, with some of her own calling her a disappointment at the same time as opponents allege she is a radical who is going way too far.Her life has already been a canvas for debates about stay-at-home motherhood, marriage, ambition and the tendency of female leaders to be perceived as less likable. As the occupant of the Oval Office, the scrutiny could be even more relentless.How we provided real-time analysis of the final night of the Democratic National Convention, featuring Chelsea and Hillary Clinton.The question is whether a President Hillary Clinton would be re-enacting familiar gender dynamics on a larger stage or shifting them, in part just by showing up to work each day.\u201cWhen a young woman walks into a classroom, a 15-year-old boy will think to himself, she could be president one day,\u201d said Abby Wambach, 36, the soccer player and the author of a forthcoming memoir that describes her fight for equality as a female athlete, who has campaigned for Mrs. Clinton.Other women say that if she wins, they may change their own behavior. The novelist Ann Patchett, 52, said that the election of a female president could convince her to hand over more domestic chores to her husband. She is a best-selling author and bookstore owner, but a woman in the Oval Office would help her believe that her work is as important as her physician husband\u2019s, she said.Other women feel dawning possibility, but are not entirely sure what to expect. Nancy Lyons, 50, the chief executive of a design and technology agency in Minneapolis, came up with her own analogy to describe what the moment means for her.Watching Mrs. Clinton accept the nomination is like witnessing the space missions of her childhood, she said. Hillary Clinton is in a place no woman has ever been before, possibly about to go even further. She needs to execute precisely, to show great endurance and daring. Ms. Lyons is both cheering and dreading failure.\u201cHillary Clinton is like an astronaut now,\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood, Christina Capecchi, Natalie Pita and Nate Schweber.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Swift Reaction to Doping Report Blames Anti-Russian Politics", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin responded within hours Monday to accusations that his government ran a covert doping program for Russian Olympians and other elite athletes, indicating how seriously the Kremlin took the charges.The government often waits days to react to issues raised abroad, if it responds at all, but international sports competitions in general and the Olympics in particular are important to Mr. Putin.The outline of how the Kremlin will play the issue was evident in his initial reaction. On the one hand, Mr. Putin went on at length with his boilerplate accusation that the decision was highly politicized, probably pushed by the sinister hand of the United States.Yet he also pledged cooperation, saying Russia would suspend all those named in the report and complete its own investigation. The Kremlin made clear, however, that Vitaly Mutko \u2014 the minister of sport, and a Putin loyalist \u2014 would not be suspended, since he was not named.Mr. Mutko said the report would be examined carefully, but he called it \u201cdistressing\u201d that it was based on the testimony from a former Russian official identified as the source of the doping scheme.The report by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer commissioned by WADA, confirmed \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that Russia was involved in an elaborate doping scheme that stretched beyond the Sochi Games.\u201cToday he was called an honest man, a reliable source,\u201d Mr. Mutko said. \u201cThis raises eyebrows.\u201dThe WADA news conference was broadcast live on state television, complete with the accusations that the F.S.B., the state security agency that Mr. Putin used to direct, helped run the doping program.In his reaction, Mr. Putin evoked the 1980 boycott of the Moscow Summer Games by much of the West over the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the Russian boycott of Los Angeles four years later.\u201cToday we see a dangerous relapse of politics intruding into sports,\u201d he said, warning of a brewing \u201cschism.\u201dGiven the demand by the American antidoping agency even before Monday\u2019s news conference that Russia be suspended from the Olympics, Mr. Putin said that \u201cone country\u2019s national organization is again trying to dictate its will to the entire world sports community.\u201dA step-by-step look at how Russian agents used an elaborate scheme to swap out tainted urine samples for clean ones taken months earlier.Both the Russian news channels and RT, the Kremlin-funded English-language television news channel, skipped over the consequences for Rio and concentrated on questions about the evidence and accusations of an anti-Russia propaganda war.Few analysts thought that the doping issue would dent Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity rating, which has hovered at 81 percent all year, according to the independent Levada Center polling organization.State propaganda will be sure to paint the episode as \u201cThe West is humiliating us\u201d rather than \u201cThe government lies to us all the time,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov, an expert on international relations. Mr. Putin hopes to get Western economic sanctions lifted, however, so he will not want to escalate the rhetoric too much, Mr. Frolov said.As with most issues in Russia, where a vast majority of the people support the government and a small minority despair of its endless corruption, the reaction on social media diverged. Besides the supportive nationalists and the mocking opposition, there were a few calm voices suggesting there was too much to the WADA report to be invented.\u201cTo combat doping, we have to unite, instead of making a pariah of a single country,\u201d Svetlana Zhurova, a 2006 ice skating Olympic champion and currently a member of Parliament, was quoted as telling the TASS news agency.\u201cWho sits on WADA?\u201d a man wrote on the website Vkontakte, a Russian version of Facebook. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Americans and Canadians. Do you believe them? Well, then there are chemical weapons in Iraq, right, it\u2019s just that they weren\u2019t found.\u201dSome officials said banning Russia from the Olympics was tantamount to ruining the Games, while others called for a pre-emptive boycott.Among critics, much was made of the accusation that an F.S.B. agent posing as a plumber helped to substitute urine samples of the Olympians. One critic suggested that urinating into bottles to make a star athlete look clean was now probably worthy of a secret medal for \u201cduty to the motherland.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Podesta, as her husband pops in with a quick thought or a disarming compliment.Deeply confident that she would perform better as the president than as a political candidate, Mrs. Clinton wants to pursue a whole new approach at the White House to try to break through years of partisan gridlock, according to a dozen campaign advisers and allies who described her goals and outlook. From policy goals and personnel to her instinct for patiently cultivating the enemy, Mrs. Clinton thinks she would be a better dealmaker than President Obama if she finds willing partners on the other side.Her opening might be a narrow one. She faces skepticism on the right about her willingness to compromise and her potential use of executive actions, and there is outright suspicion on the left that she might sell out progressive goals for the sake of bipartisan action with Republicans.Still, Democrats close to her say she has a real touch with power brokers in both parties that could yield surprising results.\u201cTo be crystal clear: She has led many battles where you can\u2019t compromise on principle,\u201d Ms. Tanden added. \u201cBut she also loves socializing, loves having people and spouses over, and really loves talking over drinks.\u201dHer calculation is that she will be dealing with a Republican Party that is deeply fractured and demoralized after the defeat of Mr. Trump, whose leaders will be searching for ways to show they can govern and to court Hispanics if Mr. Trump loses badly with them. Mrs. Clinton also thinks a huge Democratic turnout this fall would put the Senate back in her party\u2019s hands, while Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Republicans would have a reduced majority in the House.What Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Clinton do not know \u2014 but regularly explore in conversations, according to friends \u2014 is whether Republican leaders, even if their power is diminished, would be in a mood to cooperate.Yet some of them are open to her two early priorities: $275 billion in infrastructure spending, and an immigration bill with a path to citizenship like the one already passed by the Senate. Given how deeply immigration has divided the Republican Party, no other issue would probably reveal more about the ability of a President Hillary Clinton and a Republican-led House to work together.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cI said I\u2019d ask her, and she was eager to go, which I think shows a willingness to get things done,\u201d said the aide, Melanne Verveer, who became Mrs. Clinton\u2019s White House chief of staff.\u201cShe can be extremely charming, and she can be the opposite,\u201d said Tom Davis, a former senior House Republican from Virginia. \u201cBut I think she\u2019ll want to build some bridges right away and get back some of the trust that\u2019s been missing between the parties for the last 15 years.\u201dAllies of the House and Senate Republican leaders said they would be more inclined to work with a President Hillary Clinton if she showed a willingness to compromise on priorities for many fiscal conservatives like overhauling Social Security. Yet Mrs. Clinton, like many in her party, opposes Republican proposals to cut benefits and raise the retirement age, and she has said she is open to raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes. Should she deviate from those positions, leaders of liberal groups \u2014 not to mention her primary race opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and his full-throated supporters \u2014 would pounce on her.These Democrats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations with Mrs. Clinton and her advisers, said that Mr. Podesta, her campaign chairman, would have the right of first refusal on becoming her chief of staff, a job he held under Mr. Clinton. If he turns it down, Mrs. Clinton would look at appointing a woman to that job, which has been held only by men.Mrs. Clinton has assigned three top aides \u2014 Ann O\u2019Leary, Ed Meier and Sara Latham \u2014 to oversee transition planning, reporting to Mr. Podesta. Clinton advisers say they do not expect Mr. Clinton to be constantly visible in the early months beyond whatever duties Mrs. Clinton gives him on economic policy and foreign affairs. The Clintons\u2019 priority is that he does not do anything that distracts from her agenda or overshadows her as the country gets used to having a former president (and a man) in the role of first spouse.One role he will be welcome to play is as an icebreaker at the Oval Office happy hour.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to use alcohol as a political lubricant came up repeatedly when allies and advisers were asked how she might work with Republicans. Her tale about a drinking contest with Senator John McCain of Arizona is now a Washington legend. (She said they called it quits before things got out of hand.) She believes that a relaxed, frank discussion is more authentic than trying to bond awkwardly with adversaries over sports \u2014 and more productive than keeping them at arm\u2019s length, as Mr. Obama has often done.\u201cShe likes to cajole, she likes to make deals, and she likes to make friends,\u201d said Richard Socarides, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton and a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cAnd she knows it\u2019s much harder to go after someone who you basically like, who you\u2019ve had a drink with.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suspect in Dallas Attack Had Interest in Black Power Groups", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe man who the Dallas police say killed five officers in a barrage of bullets on Thursday was a troubled Army reservist who left Afghanistan under a cloud of sexual harassment charges made by a fellow soldier who sought an order of protection against him and said he needed mental health counseling.Micah Johnson, 25, left the service in 2015, moving back to the Dallas area, where he had grown up. There, he gravitated toward black power groups, displaying his affinity for them on Facebook.His profile page, which has since been taken down, paid homage to black pride, featuring images of a raised fist and pictures of the red, black and green Pan-African flag. Both have been symbols of nonviolent black empowerment for decades, but have also been co-opted by extremist groups with racist views.And when the authorities searched Mr. Johnson\u2019s home on Friday, after he had been killed by the police, they said they found \u201cbomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics.\u201dMr. Johnson, who the police said acted alone, served in the Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015, leaving as a private first class, according to Army records.He was deployed to Afghanistan in November 2013 with the 420th Engineer Brigade, based in Seagoville, Tex. His job specialty was as a mason and carpenter. Nothing in his records suggests that he saw combat or was injured.While he was in Afghanistan, a female soldier in Mr. Johnson\u2019s unit accused him of sexual harassment, according to Bradford Glendening, the military lawyer assigned to represent Mr. Johnson when he returned to Texas.Quoting from Mr. Johnson\u2019s file, which was dated May 2014, Mr. Glendening said that Mr. Johnson\u2019s accuser recommended that he receive \u201cmental help.\u201d She also requested \u201ca protective order against Pfc. Johnson pertaining to myself, my family, home, restaurant and any other place of residence I may reside at.\u201dAccording to Mr. Glendening, the Army initiated proceedings to kick Mr. Johnson out of the military for what is known as an other than honorable discharge.\u201cThey didn\u2019t like him, that was very clear from talking to his commander,\u201d Mr. Glendening said.On Mr. Glendening\u2019s advice, Mr. Johnson waived his right to a hearing in exchange for a lesser charge.The other group was the African American Defense League, which was formed in 2014 by a man named Mauricelm-lei Millere.\u201cMillere is known for calling for violence against police specifically, on a regular basis,\u201d said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism. \u201cUsually after a high profile police-related shooting he takes to social media to encourage violence against police.\u201dAfter the killing of Laquan McDonald in Chicago, Mr. Millere called for \u201cdeath to every blue, bastard, hypocrites, killer pig across the nation,\u201d according to Mr. Segal.Mr. Johnson\u2019s Facebook page also included a picture of himself with Richard Griffin of the rap group Public Enemy.In a series of posts on Twitter, Mr. Griffin said that he did not know Mr. Johnson and that he did not \u201cadvocate killing cops.\u201dOnly days before the shootings, after a police officer fatally shot a black man during a routine traffic stop in Minnesota, Mr. Johnson\u2019s younger sister, Nicole, had taken to social media to express outrage.\u201cWhite ppl have and will continue to kill us off,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe only difference is they serve the system hiding behind that blue suit and get off easy murdering civilians. Everything coming into the light and i for one think these cops need to get a taste of the life we now fear.\u201dFive officers were killed and seven others were shot during a protest in downtown Dallas.After Mr. Johnson was identified as the gunman in Dallas, she returned to her Facebook page to express anguish: \u201cI keep saying its not true...my eyes hurt from crying. Y him???\u201dMr. Johnson graduated in 2009 from John Horn High School in Mesquite, Tex., where he was a part of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, according to Allison Lewallyn, a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District. He joined the Army Reserve after graduation.A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that Mr. Johnson circulated among potential employers in January said he had worked since September 2014 for an organization called Touch of Kindness, transporting \u201cmentally challenged\u201d children and adults to appointments and helping teach them \u201cbasic living skills.\u201d He also listed himself as a former shift manager and driver at a Jimmy John\u2019s sandwich shop and as a foreman at a company that distributed fliers.The community where Mr. Johnson lived with his mother is a quiet suburban subdivision with two-story, brick cookie-cutter-type homes. The family\u2019s house sits across from a large empty, grassy field. Hundreds of reporters swarmed the neighborhood. A police car parked in front of the home kept journalists away.During a lengthy standoff on Thursday, Mr. Johnson told police negotiators that he was \u201cupset about Black Lives Matter,\u201d as well as the recent police shootings of black men, according to David O. Brown, the Dallas police chief.\u201cThe suspect said he was upset at white people,\u201d Chief Brown said. \u201cThe suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.\u201dA local activist, Yafeuh Balogun, said that he had spotted Mr. Johnson at demonstrations, but described him as more of a lone wolf. \u201cHe was part of a loose-knit group of citizens that feel there needs to be some change that needs to take place,\u201d Mr. Balogun said. \u201cThe difference is Micah took an extreme position.\u201dReporting was contributed by John Eligon, Richard Fausset, Dave Phillipps, Steve Eder and Michael S.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.A big part of what has made Amazon\u2019s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon\u2019s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers \u2014 the warehouses from which it processes customer orders \u2014 in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year.Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon.\u201cI would not take our financial results as an indication we\u2019re running out of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to really prove out their profitability,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Amazon\u2019s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results.The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business.The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing.Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google.Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company\u2019s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.The company\u2019s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\u201cThey are defying the laws of gravity,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt shows their level of market share gains is increasing.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings misstated the number of consecutive quarters in which Amazon has shown a record profit.

{"Headline": "Concerned About Zika, More Top Tennis Players Are Skipping Olympics", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rafael Nadal, who has not played a match since withdrawing from the French Open in May because of a wrist injury, sounded a note of optimism that his recovery would allow him to compete in the Rio Olympics, after he missed the London Olympics four years ago with a different injury.\u201cAlthough, as I always say, there is nothing certain in this life,\u201d Nadal told reporters in Majorca on Wednesday.The uncertainty surrounding the Rio Olympics has become more pronounced in tennis, with four top players in the last five days having announced that they will skip the Games, now only two and a half weeks away.Two men, seventh-ranked Milos Raonic and eighth-ranked Tomas Berdych, and two women, fifth-ranked Simona Halep and 17th-ranked Karolina Pliskova, expressed concerns over Zika, which had been largely minimized by players who answered questions about the virus during the French Open and Wimbledon.Berdych, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals, said previous tournaments had kept him too busy to think about the Olympics until recently.\u201cObviously, I\u2019ve known about the virus a long time, since when it all started,\u201d Berdych said Tuesday at the Citi Open in Washington. \u201cBut of course the season was going on\u201dBerdych, who said he hoped to compete in the 2020 Olympics, said that he could not justify the risks that he saw to his life after tennis.\u201cI\u2019m going to play two, three, four years, and then the rest of my life will be another 60 years, something like that,\u201d Berdych said. \u201cIf something happens that makes that not the way you want it, because of one week or one tournament, you might have a sad life. No, I don\u2019t think so; I don\u2019t want to take that risk, even if the risks are possibly small or whatever.\u201dAlthough several male players removed themselves from Olympic consideration because of a desire to focus on ATP events \u2014 which Raonic also cited in an interview after his initial announcement \u2014 only one player had mentioned Zika before late last week as a reason for not traveling to Brazil. That was Alexandr Dolgopolov, who pulled out in June and cited Zika as a particular concern giving his existing medical concerns, which include Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, a liver condition.Concerns over Zika had been discussed privately, however. Horia Tecau, who had planned to play mixed doubles with Halep, a fellow Romanian, before she announced her withdrawal, said that Halep had expressed concerns weeks ago about the virus. Tecau, who still hopes to qualify for the mixed doubles event with a lower-ranked partner, said the withdrawals by Halep and other athletes had disappointed him, especially given what he sees as the relatively low risk posed by the virus.\u201cWhen I keep hearing about this virus, if you sit down and think about all the stuff that we go through during the year, with everything that\u2019s happening in the world now, there\u2019s a lot of risk everywhere,\u201d Tecau said. \u201cI think this Zika virus is a very small percentage out of that risk. It\u2019s not a solid enough reason.\u201dOther players are also confident. Denis Kudla, an American, expressed faith in organizers\u2019 preparedness and said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more than that to not go to the Olympics.\u201dBrazilians, such as Bruno Soares, a doubles champion at this year\u2019s Australian Open, have been outspoken about assuaging the panic over the virus.\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world or something like this,\u201d Soares said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a little bit of my duty just to try to inform people.\u201dSoares has cited the incident-less ATP event in Rio de Janeiro in February, when mosquitoes are in season, as reason for his fellow players to be at ease.\u201cSo many guys came to me in the last swing in Europe saying, \u2018What\u2019s the real situation over there?\u2019\u201d Soares said. \u201cInternational media is just making such a huge thing out of it. I\u2019m saying: \u2018Listen, guys: I\u2019m from Brazil. We played the Rio event in the summer, when the mosquitoes are way worse \u2014 they don\u2019t really grow during winter \u2014 and there was zero cases.\u2019 If you go to Brazil, there\u2019s no worry about that. People are just living normal lives.\u201dOthers remain concerned over the mixed signals. Samantha Stosur, an Australian, said she was \u201cabsolutely, 100 percent going\u201d but admitted that she had more questions about these Games than about the three previous Olympics she had attended.Eugenie Bouchard, a Canadian, remains undecided.\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone knows enough about it to really give a good opinion on whether, as athletes, we should go or not,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if the health of my future babies is worth it. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to decide in my head.\u201dSloane Stephens of the United States said that she had received conflicting medical advice but that she planned to go \u2014 and to pack the mosquito nets she had already bought.\u201cOne doctor I talked to said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t go, because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u2019 and yada, yada,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cAnd some other doctors are like, \u2018You know, if this is your dream and you want to go play the Olympics?

After days of searching frantically for her, Laura\u2019s family learned on Sunday morning that she was dead.\u201cWe miss you already; we will love you always,\u201d her 19-year-old sister, Lucie, said in a Facebook post.At least 10 children were killed Thursday night, and at least 35 were treated for injuries at hospitals in Nice. Others were separated from their parents in the chaos, and some no doubt saw and heard things they might carry with them for a long time.No one who was visiting the waterfront that night could have imagined such a horrific ending. Going to the fireworks on July 14 is an annual family ritual in Nice, a time for picnics on the beach \u2014 and, when the beach is too full, for spreading tablecloths on the meridian of the waterfront road known for more than 150 years as the Promenade des Anglais. From there, people have a fine view of the sea and the extravagant fireworks display.\u201cYou have to bring your children because if you don\u2019t, you will pay for it all year \u2014 all their friends are there,\u201d said Raja El Kamel, 43, Haroun\u2019s mother, who was with him and a close friend from Sweden and her two children to watch the festivities.In a city that enjoys a party, the July 14 fireworks are especially beloved because the entire community joins in: Christian and Muslim, religious and secular, but French above all. The presence of large numbers of tourists gives the evening even more of a festive feel.For 4\u00bd-year-old Yanis and his parents, Mickael and Samira Coviaux, the evening was a first. The parents, both truck drivers, live in Grenoble, and this was their first time seeing the July 14 fireworks on the Mediterranean as a family, said Yanis\u2019s aunt Ana\u00efs Coviaux, a law student in Paris, who came to support her brother and sister-in-law after Yanis was killed.\u201cThe children were playing among themselves, and they had their back to the road,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did not hear the truck until just one second before it hit. It went up on the sidewalk; it struck Yanis and the mother of one of the other children with them.\u201d The mother also died.There was no first aid nearby. Finally, Mr. Coviaux picked up his little boy and began walking with him until they found a person with a car who agreed to take them to the hospital. When they passed some firefighters, they stopped and asked them to try to revive him. But the child was dead.\u201cHe was my parents\u2019 only grandson, the only grandson in the family,\u201d Ana\u00efs Coviaux said softly. She explained that her brother and his wife were too distraught to speak. \u201cYanis loved people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe especially liked Sundays when all the family was gathered, and he would say, \u2018Mamie and Papi, we are going to have a party.\u2019\u201dLater, Mr. Coviaux said in an email that \u201cevery single person that Yanis met in his short life fell in love with him.\u201dThe entire family gathered on the promenade Saturday to view the last sights he had seen.\u201cIt was important for us to come to the place he died to pay him a tribute,\u201d Ana\u00efs Coviaux said, \u201cbecause we could not bear to say goodbye to him. We left a picture of him and flowers.\u201dIdentifying children and examining them has been difficult because of the level of trauma and because some were brought to the hospital without relatives, said Sylvie Serret, a child psychiatrist at the Lenval Foundation hospital, which treated at least 30 injured children on Thursday night.\u201cA lot of the children coming in were in a state of shock; they were not speaking, for instance,\u201d she said.An emergency room nurse at Pasteur Hospital, Mejdi Chemakhi, cared for several children, including a boy and a girl who had been brought in without their parents. The boy was 4, Mr. Chemakhi said, and the girl was 6.The boy, Mr. Chemakhi recounted, spoke in a flat tone, apparently in shock.\u201cMy mummy is dead, but my daddy is still alive,\u201d he recalled the boy saying over and over. The boy, expressionless, finally said, \u201cI am tired, I need to sleep, I have no clothes,\u201d Mr. Chemakhi recalled.\u201cSo I took him in my arms and tried to console him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what else to do in those situations. It is really important to make them feel safe.\u201dLater that night, a wounded man was brought to the hospital and told Mr. Chemakhi that he had lost his wife and could not find his children, a boy and a girl. Mr. Chemakhi realized the three belonged together and helped reunite them.On the Promenade des Anglais on Saturday, there were memorials of flowers and notes, sometimes every few feet, to mark where people had lost their lives. Nathalie Russo, 30, a Muslim who wears a hijab, came with her mother to retrace the steps she and her children, 5-year-old Mayssa and 2-year-old Emine, took on Thursday night.\u201cMy daughter is telling me that she does not want to see fireworks again,\u201d Ms. Russo said, adding, \u201cShe kept asking me, \u2018How did the bad people get from Paris to Nice?\u2019\u201d\u201cShe thought the man who did this was one of those who attacked the Bataclan,\u201d she said, \u201cand he had come here to do the same thing.\u201dSome mothers and fathers who had not been near the fireworks brought their children to see the memorials on Saturday as a way of expressing unity with the community and defiance toward the terrorists.Nour Hamila, a Nice native who has converted to Islam, made a point of bringing her three children, who are 8, 5 and 3. \u201cI told them not to be afraid because that\u2019s what the terrorists want; we have to support each other,\u201d she said as her 5-year-old son, Mohamed, placed flowers on one of the memorials.It is harder for those children who witnessed the killings.For Ms. Kamel\u2019s 12-year-old son, Haroun, the moment is etched in his mind.\u201cWe saw it from far away, a white truck in this black night,\u201d she said. She recalled thinking that the truck did not belong there because the street was closed to traffic.Her son and her friend\u2019s 12-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter were playing and laughing. Then the driver accelerated and began to veer from one side of the road to the other, \u201cplowing into people,\u201d she said.Somehow she pushed herself and her son onto the sidewalk as the truck neared. Then it passed, and all she remembers was her son saying, \u201cMama, Mama, you must come to help the people.\u201dShe looked at the road and recognized a neighbor who was kneeling next to her husband, wailing his name. Ms. Kamel told her son to go with her friend and the other children.Everything was silent. \u201cThere was just this terrible wind,\u201d she said.\u201cTo the left you saw bodies; you looked right and saw bodies; there were strollers, and people trying to save other people.\u201dAfter trying to comfort her neighbor, she looked for her son, but by then the crowds were running, and it was chaos. Hours later, when she found him and her friend, her son said, \u201cMama, did you manage to save the man?\u201dMs. Kamel responded that the emergency services had come for him.\u201cYou know, children don\u2019t have a global vision,\u201d she said. \u201cHe saw all those corpses, but for him, the one at his feet was supposed to be saved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Line Rises in Initial Public Offering, Cheering Skittish Tech Industry", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byThe Line Corporation, the owner of a Japanese instant messaging app with a colorful cast of cartoon characters, cheered the technology industry on Thursday when its shares jumped 30 percent in their American trading debut.The strong showing offers hope for tech firms and their financial backers that Wall Street investors are warming up to closely held technology start-ups. But experts say Line is an unusual case of an established company with operating heft and a proven way to gin up sales \u2014 something that many new tech companies lack.Line itself still faces considerable hurdles, such as slowing user growth and an untested plan to use advertising to help make it profitable.Line\u2019s American depositary shares, priced at $32.84 each on Monday, jumped to $42.70 in early trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is expected to begin trading in Japan on Friday.Line\u2019s debut coincided with another new high for the equity markets in the United States. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has surged 8 percent since June 27, after Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union roiled stocks worldwide, as investors anticipated additional stimulus from central banks.Global uncertainty has hurt the market for initial public offerings. The value of I.P.O.s dropped to $50.7 billion so far this year from $107.9 billion for the same period last year, according to Dealogic, a data provider. In technology, the value dropped to $4.9 billion from $13.3 billion.Line\u2019s I.P.O., the largest tech offering since First Data went public in October 2015, is likely to encourage others. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the tech market that there is one large scale I.P.O. happening,\u201d said Serkan Toto, a game industry consultant in Japan.But Line also has some unique qualities. The service is well established, having begun start five years ago as a way for Japanese people to communicate after the devastating earthquake that year. It is controlled by Naver, a large South Korean company with a number of other internet businesses. It claims 218 million monthly active users, many of them in populous Southeast Asian markets, prompting industry observers to compare it to other established social media networks like Facebook and Twitter.It has also posted strong revenue growth by selling its users what it calls stickers: small, often animated cartoon characters that include Disney and comic book figures as well as its own menagerie of in-house mascots. Stickers can sell for about $2 each. \u201cThe customers are engaging with the brand, liking it,\u201d said Neha Dharia, a senior analyst at Ovum. \u201cCustomers are seeking out the brand.\u201dThat encourages investors who see potential in Line to make a significant amount of money from advertising \u2014 an area where Twitter and others have struggled to turn millions of eyes into a steady revenue stream. Nearly one-third of its revenue comes from advertising. Like other Asian chat apps, such as China\u2019s WeChat and South Korea\u2019s KakaoTalk, it is also increasingly a platform for services that allow users to hail rides or order food.\u201cAsia\u2019s mobile messengers such as Line, KakaoTalk, and WeChat are now making money,\u201d Yongjei Jeong, an equity research analyst for Mirae Asset Securities, wrote in an email.In terms of making money, Line is not quite there yet. It posted a $2 million loss in the first three months of the year as rising employee costs and other expenses offset revenue growth, though its loss narrowed sharply compared with a year earlier.Line\u2019s user growth has also slowed, raising questions about whether it can expand beyond its markets. \u201cLine has been restricted to Japan and pockets of Southeast Asia,\u201d Ms. Dharia said. \u201cTo replicate that experience in other markets, it takes a lot of effort.\u201dIn other markets, a lack of hit games and an underused newsfeed feature will make it vulnerable to competitors like Facebook, said Mr. Toto, the game industry consultant in Japan. Leveraging its dominance in its existing markets \u201cis Line\u2019s only chance,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of their core markets, it\u2019s game over.\u201dLine in Japan referred questions to representatives in the United States, who did not respond to requests for comment, and to the company\u2019s filings.Line could give a sense of how well it is doing in advertising when it publishes its second-quarter earnings at the end of this month. Investors will also be looking for whether the company increases marketing or strikes a deal to get into new markets. \u201cThey have a lot of cash after the I.P.O.,\u201d said Jaemin Ahn, an internet and media analyst at NH Investment & Securities.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "England\u2019s Reflexive Pronoun Epidemic", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byThere is a reflexive pronoun epidemic in England that, while it may not be high on the list of the world\u2019s problems, is suggestive of some serious social weirdness. It\u2019s a straining for exaggerated politeness or elevated speech that reflects a society still riven by class.\u201cDoes that work for yourself?\u201d \u201cCould we perhaps have a quote from yourself?\u201d \u201cIs the water temperature right for yourself?\u201d \u201cWe will have that fixed for yourself as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cI have booked the flight for yourself.\u201dYes, that is all fine for myself!!! (I would not dream of ending that last sentence with a period as it may appear unenthusiastic when I want to exude delight at being addressed with such deference.) In fact, thanks to yourself, it\u2019s been a great day for myself!!!What on earth is wrong with little old \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cme?\u201d They are words too short and too plain for the hospitality and service industries that now make up a big chunk of the British economy. People used to manufacture machines. Now they manufacture obsequious multisyllabic reflexive pronouns with a letter quotient designed to aggrandize yourselves, and so render yourself pliant to opening your wallet.It\u2019s all part of the \u201cbespoke\u201d experience!! Don\u2019t get me started on that.Of course, I have to curb the overwhelming urge to tell people that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cme\u201d are just fine for ME (as they should be for YOU), as that would reveal my own snobbery in reaction to their inverted, or misplaced, or attempted snobbery; so sharpening corrosive social divisions.That would not be good for a country, or what is left of it, that recently saw two old Etonians, David Cameron and Boris Johnson, duel over Britain\u2019s European future and produce a disaster for myself, yourself, herself, himself and just about any self.There is no doubt, at least for myself, that this reflexive pronoun business has now outstripped apostrophe abuse as the supreme grammatical annoyance. Its such an irritant in it\u2019s way \u2014 perhaps also to yourselve\u2019s?!?!There is also the uncontrolled use of the word \u201cpop\u201d to consider \u2014 \u201cpop a signature on there,\u201d \u201cpop your seat upright,\u201d \u201cpop me an e-mail\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s a short word that falls within the ambit of that maddeningly meaningless phrase: It is what it is.Now if any British corporation \u201creached out\u201d to its employees on the issue of the misuse of reflexive pronouns, it would probably have to \u201ctake the issue offline\u201d because of its sensitivity, \u201cunpack\u201d all the nuances, make discussion of it \u201ca regular thing going forward,\u201d \u201cdrill down\u201d as far as possible, \u201cget its ducks in a row\u201d before deciding to \u201caction\u201d any change, and generally have a \u201cthought shower\u201d (\u201cbrainstorm\u201d is now, it seems, considered offensive to epileptics) about how its clients \u201cthemselves\u201d might react.Not bothering with all this is clearly a no-brainer!!!I know that there is no escaping the little irritants in life, like asking for ice in your Coke in France and getting a single ice cube; or the beeps and pings that now issue from every electronic contraption; or seeing a bottle of good wine emptied by some overzealous sommelier into four glasses filled almost to the brim; or losing out to the fine print; or being defeated in the quest to speak to a human being by some devilish labyrinth of automated responses; or having to listen to an explanation of why anyone would want a driverless car; or password hell; or just finding yourself in an airport alongside all the other suckers who know for a fact that whatever happened to Osama bin Laden was grossly insufficient punishment.So it goes. You just have to breathe deeply and be grateful for the gift of breath. YOLO! Don\u2019t get me started on that, either.The English reflexive pronoun thing has not crossed the Atlantic, yet, but \u201cno worries\u201d has (having previously made the longer crossing from Australia). I\u2019m just not in a space right now where I can deal with that. (\u201cOh, really, where are you then?\u201d)It may just be time to \u201coffboard\u201d as I\u2019m not sure I have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to be \u201clooped\u201d into a discussion of how anyone can say \u201cno worries\u201d at this particular moment in history, whatever side of the Atlantic himself or herself happens to be situated on. I mean that\u2019s just beyond. What would be even the thematic tent poles of the debate? I can\u2019t even!!Let\u2019s face it: \u201cDoes that work for yourself?\u201d is never going to work in New York City, which would rather tell you to \u201cdrop dead\u201d than adopt that affectation. So there are limits to the global homogenization of bad English after all. Neither deference nor pomposity is a New York thing. America is not classless; it\u2019s just not class obsessed.That in plain English will about do it for myself.Advertisement"}

There is a human woman running, sometimes making mistakes, sometime enduring private pain publicly, sometimes soaring to the highest levels of achievement.Let\u2019s not hold her to a standard of perfection we wouldn\u2019t apply to a man running for president, let\u2019s honor her humanity and success as the first woman to achieve the nomination of a major party.I firmly believe that something similar is required on the Left. Hillary Clinton is no monster like Trump, but she is the calcification of a leftist-flavored version of what is wrong with politics today: the intransigence and pandering, the corruption and secrecy, the influence of big money, and a no-holds-barred, the ends-justify-the-means approach to an entitled sense of rulership.The Democratic Party has a chance to see what its Bernie contingent is pointing out to party leadership.

{"Headline": "Philando Castile\u2019s Last Night: Tacos and Laughs, Then a Drive", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Philando Castile had just finished getting his hair styled last Wednesday when he called his sister, Allysza, and offered to deliver dinner to the suburban house she shares with their mother.\u201cWe talked about all this stuff: \u2018Did you see that video on Facebook of the man getting killed?\u2019\u201d Ms. Castile recalled in an interview Tuesday. \u201cI said, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t watch it, bro. I refuse to watch another video.\u2019\u201dAfter a while, Mr. Castile left, and his sister fell asleep. Her brother had apparently gone back to his apartment in St. Paul to pick up his girlfriend, and then shopped at a grocery store. Before he made it home, two St. Anthony police officers saw him driving a wide-bodied Oldsmobile and pulled him over on Larpenteur Avenue near the state fairgrounds in the tiny, majority-white suburb of Falcon Heights.\u201cWhen I woke up from my nap,\u201d Ms. Castile said through tears, \u201call hell had been broken out.\u201dThe video sparked almost immediate outrage and protests, raising questions about the role of race in the traffic stop and in the reaction by the officer, later identified as Jeronimo Yanez.The official version of what happened remains largely opaque, with no radio traffic or dashboard camera footage released by the authorities, and only the vaguest outline of events provided by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the agency that is investigating. Thomas Kelly, the lawyer for Officer Yanez, has said that his client had more reason to pull him over than a problematic taillight mentioned by Ms. Reynolds in the Facebook video, and that it was the presence of a gun that prompted him to shoot.As demonstrators have marched in recent days, Ms. Castile and her mother, Valerie, have been left to plan a funeral, now set for Thursday, and plot the start of a course that they hope will lead to better police training, changes to state law and jail time for Officer Yanez. Valerie Castile said she believed her son had told Officer Yanez that he had a permit to carry a gun, and that he was armed, before the policeman saw his weapon and opened fire.\u201cAll I can say is that I don\u2019t know anywhere on this planet where if you tell the truth and are honest, you die,\u201d said Valerie Castile, who said she believed her son had been racially profiled by the police in this region for years, amassing at least 52 traffic or parking cases recorded in a state court database. \u201cIf this is where humanity is headed to, we\u2019re doomed.\u201dValerie Castile and her lawyer, Glenda Hatchett, called on Tuesday for a special prosecutor to take over the case, asked the Justice Department to again consider starting its own investigation and fielded a phone call from Air Force One in which President Obama offered his condolences.Valerie Castile said she moved to Minnesota from the St. Louis area when her son was a toddler because this place seemed devoid of the blight and other problems that worried her in Missouri.And, in many ways, her son thrived here. As a teenager, she said, Mr. Castile took jobs fixing bikes and working at Blockbuster and Target stores. Not long after graduating from St. Paul public schools, he went to work for the school district in nutrition services, eventually earning a promotion to supervisor, the affection of the children and the name Mr. Phil from the students he served. \u201cHe loved his job,\u201d Valerie Castile said. \u201cHe was an all-around good kid. He never got in trouble with me.\u201dBut on the roadways, he found himself in trouble frequently. Of the 52 cases against him in the state\u2019s court records system, all appeared traffic-related. Many were dismissed, some resulted in convictions, and none were for violations more serious than a misdemeanor.Valerie Castile said she believed her son was targeted for the type of car he preferred \u2014 older ones that she said the police stereotyped as belonging to drug dealers \u2014 and the color of his skin.\u201cMy position is that he shouldn\u2019t have been stopped in the first place,\u201d said Ms. Hatchett, the family lawyer, who said Tuesday that she would file a federal lawsuit against those responsible for Mr. Castile\u2019s death.In each of the three small suburbs patrolled by the St. Anthony police, less than 10 percent of the population is black. But data released by the city on Tuesday showed that a far higher percentage of the people ticketed or arrested by St. Anthony officers were African-American.Last year, around 19 percent of those cited by St. Anthony police were black, as were roughly 41 percent of people arrested by the department, a review of the city\u2019s data showed. Those percentages do not include the large number of defendants whose race was unknown.St. Anthony officials did not respond to requests for clarification about whether the data they provided was for all cities patrolled by its officers or only Falcon Heights.Once Mr. Castile was pulled over last week, the family believes, the officer saw a gun, panicked and shot him unjustly. Minnesota law bars the authorities from confirming whether someone has a permit to carry a weapon, but Mr. Castile\u2019s mother and sister both said he did.Allysza Castile said that she and her brother had taken a class to become certified to carry a gun, but that she had cautioned him not to carry his weapon so frequently, for fear of the police overreacting.\u201cI used to tell him all the time that I do not carry my gun on me,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they will shoot first and ask questions later.\u201dMatt Furber contributed reporting from St. Paul, and Robert Gebeloff from New York.Advertisement"}

As a result, the exhibition features only new and promised gifts to the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection; more greatest hits than concept album. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seemed to me that we had already developed a pretty good collection of California photography, but it needed a certain added dimension,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt needed to be larger, more meaningful, and it needed to address things we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, in various ways, consciously addressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe show is installed in the Pritzker Center for Photography, and is slightly overwhelming in person, as the space is enormous. As a viewer, it can be hard to focus when there are so many excellent photographs on display, but several favorites did emerge.An Edward Weston picture of a whale vertebra was most likely made for its beautiful, formal qualities, but in the context of our environmentally focused times, it reads as a sad symbol of the plight of endangered species. A little-known Minor White photo made at the Daly City dump, of rubber tires on fire, also takes on added significance, as one imagines all that toxic smoke wafting skyward.Trevor Paglen, the contemporary photographic artist who recently won the 2016 Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse Prize, presents a brilliant albumen print of a military drone streaking across the sky, single-handedly linking the 19th century to the 21st.Befitting an institution in a city that supports its own, several key San Francisco photographers, including Jim Goldberg and Michael Jang,  get pride of place, too.Mr. Goldberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seminal series \u00e2\u0080\u009cRich and Poor\u00e2\u0080\u009d takes up an entire hallway, forcing viewers through a gantlet of wealth disparity that seems incredibly relevant today. The pictures, made in the early 1980s, contrast low-income residents of the Mission District with well-heeled residents of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tonier neighborhoods. (The subjects also wrote directly onto the prints.)Mr. Goldberg was open about the importance of showing such work to the public in 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIncome inequality is much deeper and more prominent, I think, in the American consciousness than it was in the late \u00e2\u0080\u009970s or early \u00e2\u0080\u009980s, when I was doing this work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would agree that these rents are crazy, and the evictions are horrible. So amid the rise of this kind of new and tech-propelled gilded class, I think my portraits of the haves can seem like artifacts from a much distant, much less corrosive version of wealth.\u00e2\u0080\u009dConversely, he was loath to criticize the new culture that has arisen, stressing that change is a constant in urban environments. He also spoke about how the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art had grown in parallel with the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise, and how it had so strenuously supported his career.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I moved here, the museum was in Herbst Theater, across from City Hall. They had the third and fourth floor. It was very small, very intimate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou literally could knock on the photography curator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door and say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hi, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Jim Goldberg. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d really like to show you my work.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And you could. I did. It was incredible.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMichael Jang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mural-size photograph of the raucous party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge was given the exhibition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frontispiece. He also owes his current career success to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, although he took a far more circuitous route than did Mr. Goldberg.Mr. Jang studied at Cal Arts in the \u00e2\u0080\u009970s and made a string of projects that are just now gaining attention, as he never pursued an art career  but chose instead to use photography to support his family.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI realized that I had to make a living if I wanted to do standard things of family, get a house and cars and all that stuff. Raise children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used the camera as a way to make money. From weddings to editorial, and later a bit of advertising and the commercial world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTen years ago, his work was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscovered\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the museum\u2019s curatorial team when, on a whim, he dropped off his portfolio, a courtesy offered to local artists.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA week or two later,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got a call saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can you come in? The curators would like to talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 At the meeting, they said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wow. What is this? Do you have more?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Heck yeah! Decades worth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a metaphor for one of life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simplest lessons: You have to take the good with the bad. That seems to be Ms. Phillips\u2019s opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely exciting, and a time for us to try and figure out a way forward, without destroying the original fabric of the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has certainly been movement of young people out of San Francisco to Oakland, and other parts of the Bay Area, and to Southern California. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely true. I would say the art world is changing. The artists are changing. And of course there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about that. But artists are also pretty interesting folk, and they can figure out their future too.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t predict doom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

But during the early years of the web, which are not all that distant, Yahoo did exactly that \u2014 and did it well.However, I come not to bury Yahoo, but to remember it fondly. In the 1990s, when I started writing about technology, the company was a central pillar of the internet. Yahoo was referred to as a \u201cweb portal,\u201d and millions of people began their explorations of the online world through its home page. Internet connections were generally slow and unreliable, and there were no iPhones or Androids. It might sound terribly antiquated now, but it felt new and exciting then.Yahoo categorized and brought order to the fast-growing forest that was the web. Its curators carefully hacked through the weeds and jumped across the ravines to bring us to the digital equivalent of exotic plants and wildlife. Search technology was in its infancy, and people needed someone to help them find what this new, or new to them, world had to offer.Google, Facebook, Twitter and other sites gradually displaced Yahoo because they offered better ways to find information and interact with others. I still have a Yahoo email account, but I rarely check it. The My Yahoo page I carefully tended no longer exists.I might have stayed loyal to Yahoo if it had acquired or built a really good search engine or social networking site. Still, there is no denying that Yahoo was a pioneer that cleared the thicket for those other businesses to flourish.Advertisement"}

To Kansas Conservatives, They\u2019re \u2018Government Schools\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byLEAWOOD, Kansas \u2014 Erica Massman, a moderate Kansas Republican, refers to the building where her daughter attends fourth grade as a public school.Ms. Massman\u2019s mother, whose politics tilt further to the right, calls it something else: a government school.\u201cMy mother, who is a Tea Party person, started saying \u2018government schools\u2019 all the time,\u201d said Ms. Massman, recalling when she first heard the phrase around 2010. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201dSomewhere along the way, the term \u201cgovernment schools\u201d entered the lexicon in place of references to the public school system.The intent was obvious to her, Ms. Massman said. \u201cThey are trying to rebrand public education,\u201d she said.The use of the term has set off alarms even among some Republicans, who fear that it signals still less support, financially and otherwise, for the public schools in a state that had long felt pride over the quality of its education system. The recent adoption of a school finance plan that was acceptable to Mr. Brownback, the Legislature and the Kansas Supreme Court has not entirely assuaged those concerns.\u201cSome have begun to call public schools \u2018government schools,\u2019 a calculated pejorative scorning both education and anything related to government,\u201d he wrote.\u201cIt is surprising to me that liberals and progressives object to the term \u2018government schools,\u2019\u201d he said on the show. \u201cThey like government, don\u2019t they? These people want more taxation and government spending, don\u2019t they? Well, when we think about our public schools, we find they have all the characteristics of government programs.\u201dIt would not be the first time that conservatives have used semantics to sway public opinion, experts said.Besides coining phrases, Dr. Lakoff said, the right has co-opted certain words \u2014 a practice that was demonstrated, he said, in President George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, which used \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cliberty\u201d 49 times in 20 minutes. \u201cThe right has taken over the words \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018liberty,\u2019\u201d Dr. Lakoff said.\u201cPeople tend to trace the demonization of government to Reagan,\u201d Dr. Tannen said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of iconic, how he was using it. He set the government up as the enemy.\u201dConservatives in Kansas have extended the semantical positioning of \u201cgovernment\u201d to education, conveying the message that public schools are a form of government imposition, Dr. Lakoff said.The phrase \u201cgovernment schools,\u201d a common reference overseas to national school systems, has been around for decades as a way to differentiate them from privately financed schools. It has also been a label for schools on Native American reservations, and long used to influence debate.Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York used the phrase in 1978 to make the case for federal aid to private schools. \u201cWe have succeeded in providing equality only to those who enroll in government schools,\u201d he said in a speech in New York. \u201cWe have failed the parents who prefer to send their children to the schools that are descended from the older, private school systems.\u201dBut only recently \u2014 and mostly in reliably conservative Kansas \u2014 has the term been used regularly and clearly as a political wedge. Education advocates in Kansas said they had heard it in conversations with state legislators (though few use it in public statements), in discussions about public schools on Facebook and on some conservative news sites.The use of the term \u201cgovernment schools\u201d is part of a broad education agenda that includes restraining costs. The far-right and libertarian wings of the Republican Party are pushing the state to loosen its laws to allow more charter schools. They oppose programs that offer free or reduced-price breakfasts and lunches, believing that schools have become part of the \u201cnanny state\u201d \u2014 another politically charged term \u2014 and are usurping the role of parents.He suggested, somewhat tongue in cheek, that swapping \u201cgovernment\u201d for \u201cpublic\u201d could become a trend, with references to \u201cgovernment libraries,\u201d \u201cgovernment parks\u201d \u2014 even \u201cgovernment universities.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s austere,\u201d Dr. Locke said. \u201cIt has an oppressive ring to it.

{"Headline": "What Is a Constant Cycle of Violent News Doing to Us?", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byIt has been a rough year.By now, our violence is down to a pattern, and there is a choreography to our reactions.A killer seeks out a nightclub, a church, an airport, a courthouse, a protest. Someone is shot on video, sometimes by the police, and marchers fill the streets. An attack is carried out in France, America, Turkey, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Tunisia, Nigeria, and then claimed and celebrated by a radical terror group.Our phones vibrate with news alerts. The talking heads fill air over cable news captions that shout \u201cbreaking news\u201d in red. Rumors and misinformation abound. The comments erupt on Twitter, Facebook and news sites.So, what is this doing to us? It depends on the individual, but living in a digitally linked world where broadcasts of violence are instantaneous and almost commonplace means that many of us are becoming desensitized, Anita Gadhia-Smith, a psychologist in Washington, said Friday.\u201cWith the frequency of shootings and terror attacks there is a sense of anxiety that\u2019s building in people,\u201d she said, \u201ca sense of vulnerability and powerlessness.\u201dDr. Smith added: \u201cThere is a heightened alarm, but there can also be some desensitization that\u2019s happening.\u201dThe researchers\u2019 analysis showed that 22 percent of those who participated were significantly affected by what they saw.The study also found that people who view violent events more often were more affected than people who saw them less frequently, and that people who described themselves as extroverts with outgoing personalities were at a higher risk to be disturbed by the images.What can we do about it? Anne Marie Albano, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said in an interview after the 2015 Paris attacks that it might be a good idea to limit your exposure to social media.Designating times to plug into the news \u2014 checking Twitter in the morning over coffee, but not listening to the radio while driving your kids to school, for instance \u2014 can help you manage anxiety if you are feeling stressed.\u201cThis will help you balance a realistic and credible threat with information that is sensationalized,\u201d Dr. Albano said, \u201cor a rush to report something or talk about something that doesn\u2019t have the impact that you would think it has.\u201dIf you\u2019re feeling anxiety about a possible attack, compare your fear with the facts. When you fear the worst, it\u2019s hard to remember that, say, a flight or a train ride has extraordinarily high odds of being safe. But you have to try.Humans are bad at assessing risk, Martin Seif, a psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders and the fear of flying, said in an interview late last year.\u201cEvery single anxiety-management technique is based on the premise that your reaction is out of proportion\u201d to the likelihood of danger, Dr. Seif said.Also, remember to take a breath. Taking a walk or talking to a close friend can also help.The guide also recommends avoiding alcohol and drugs, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods \u2014 basic self-care guidelines that help reduce stress.Make sure you have a plan to contact your family if something happens, especially if cellular networks are overloaded or transportation is disrupted, but remember that you most likely will not need it, experts say.Lastly, keep your daily routine. Dr. Albano said that a primary worry in the field of psychology is people \u201cgoing out of their way to be so safe that it shrinks their world.\u201d\u201cTerrorists thrive on this kind of thing,\u201d she added. \u201cThey want to see the population change their practices.\u201d\u201dListening is curative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the basis of all therapies.\u201dMadison Mills contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was serving as the master of ceremonies of a zombie-themed show called \u201cThe Feast of Flesh,\u201d and was shrieking into a microphone while wearing full-skull makeup and leopard-print pants, which he eventually removed as a part of the performance.He would go on to play several major roles in her life, including best friend, boyfriend and soul mate, and eventually, ex-boyfriend and jilted lover.\u201cI thought he was awesome,\u201d said Ms. Mathiowetz, who had gone to the show with her boyfriend and taken photos. \u201cHe had handsome movie-star qualities and was the manliest man I had ever seen.\u201dIn April 2009, she uploaded photos on Facebook, including several of Mr. Stucky, which she labeled \u201cSome Awesome Guy.\u201dThrough mutual friends, those images found their way to Mr. Stucky, a fellow resident of Somerville, and he promptly reached out to Ms. Mathiowetz.\u201cI was blown away when he contacted me,\u201d she said.Two months later he sent her an invitation to see the film \u201cMoon,\u201d in Harvard Square, which he told her would be attended by dozens of mutual friends.Though her boyfriend wasn\u2019t available, she still went, assuming she would see familiar faces. But when only three other guests attended, none of whom she recognized, Ms. Mathiowetz said she was \u201csuddenly feeling awkward and out of place.\u201dSensing her discomfort, Mr. Stucky sat next to her, and they watched the movie together \u2014 and talked for hours afterward.She learned that he was the founding publisher of Black Ocean, a Boston-based publisher of literary books, and that he had written a book of his own, \u201cThe Truth Is We Are Perfect,\u201d a collection of poetry. He was born in Stoneham, Mass., and raised in Gloucester, and had graduated from Emerson College in Boston before receiving a master\u2019s degree in poetry at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.Her road to him began in Minneapolis, where she was born. She graduated from Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and went to Cambridge, Mass., in 2005 to work as an editorial associate for the Public Radio Exchange.\u201cShe was so smart and so beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more we talked, the more I liked everything about her.\u201dTheir conversation eventually took on a more serious tone as they began discussing the personal status of Mr. Stucky, who was going through a divorce.\u201cHe spoke about his divorce with so much emotional intelligence,\u201d she said. \u201cHe definitely came across to me as someone who had done a lot of self-reflecting.\u201dIn August 2009 Ms. Mathiowetz broke up with her boyfriend of four years, and was still reeling from their split when Mr. Stucky asked her over to his apartment to watch another movie.After some initial hesitation, she called him a week later and accepted his offer. He ordered a pizza and rented the movie \u201cHamlet II,\u201d a comedy, which cast him in a different light for her.\u201cUntil then, I had mostly thought of Janaka as this very serious, dark, reflective type,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when he rented such a silly movie, I began to see he had a fun side to him as well.\u201dAnd a romantic side.\u201cLater that night, we went out on his porch and shared our first kiss,\u201d she said.They began dating immediately. The relationship became a long-distance one in January 2010, when Ms. Mathiowetz went to the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Portland, Me., where she earned a certificate in documentary photography. Six months later, she moved back to Minneapolis to live with her sister and worked remotely from there as a website manager for the New York-based public radio show \u201cThis American Life.\u201d\u201cThe distance really didn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that mattered, from the very start, was that I was very much in love with him.\u201dHer love continued to grow, and in September 2011, she surprised him by proposing marriage. But she was stung when he turned her down.\u201cI was only recently divorced,\u201d he said, \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel the timing was right.\u201dHurt by his rejection, Ms. Mathiowetz broke off the relationship, and they began seeing other people, but still kept in touch.In October 2012, Ms. Mathiowetz moved from Minneapolis to New York to work on site for \u201cThis American Life.\u201d A month later, she and Mr. Stucky, who by now had both been a part of numerous failed dates with other people, reunited, but their relationship was no longer on solid ground.\u201cI had put him on a pedestal, and he broke my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I had a whole new life in New York, and I decided to continue to date other people.\u201dThe following summer, in 2013, Mr. Stucky, who said he began to feel that Ms. Mathiowetz \u201cwas slipping away again,\u201d proposed to her.This time, she rejected him, and they broke up once more.He begrudgingly returned to the dating scene as well, but over time, neither could find an adequate replacement for the other.\u201cA friend of mine in New York said to me \u2018You need to stop looking for Janaka in every person you date,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mathiowetz said. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what I was doing, measuring everyone I dated against him, and I was disappointed in every one of them.\u201d\u201cThey had no idea how to talk about their feelings, and they weren\u2019t interested in poetry and the kind of music that Janaka liked and they didn\u2019t pick up after themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like every other person I had met after Janaka was a mess compared to him.\u201dSo in March 2014, they began \u201ccautiously communicating again,\u201d she said.Three months later, Ms. Mathiowetz was partying with friends in New York when she consumed too many psychedelic mushrooms. The incident left her paralyzed for nearly six hours.\u201cI was surrounded by nothing but blackness and stars,\u201d she said.As she lay motionless, her only lucid thoughts, she said, were of Janaka.\u201cAll I could think of was if Janaka were here, everything would be O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cIn all that darkness, he was the only light that came shining through.\u201d As soon as she was able to crawl to her phone, she called him.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t been telling you every day that I love you,\u201d she said to him. \u201cI want to be a better person to you than I have been.\u201dMr. Stucky was feeling much the same after receiving that call. Just hours before, he, too, had a bizarre episode that left him longing for what he once had in Ms. Mathiowetz.\u201cThe night before Adrianne called me, I had a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cI was on my knees and looking up at a stranger who was telling me I had only 24 hours to live.\u201dCompletely shaken, he awoke and began taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him, and quickly realized that she was at the top of that list.His nightmare, combined with Ms. Mathiowetz\u2019s experience, landed them back together, much to the chagrin of many of their family and friends.\u201cI defended my decision to stay together by telling everyone that I did try and move on, and that I did date other people,\u201d Mr. Stucky said. \u201cBut in the end, Adrianne was the person I wanted to be with.\u201dIn January 2015, he proposed to her for a second time on a weekend trip at a bed-and-breakfast in Portsmouth, N.H. This time, she accepted. The following month, he drove from Somerville to New York to pick her up and brought her back to Boston through a blinding snowstorm.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was fate that finally brought us back together,\u201d Mr. Stucky said. \u201cBut I do know that we are definitely connected to each other on some other plane of existence.\u201dThey were married June 11 at the entrance to the formal garden at Nawandyn Estate, a private lakefront estate in Bridgton, Me., where lilies and lupines were in bloom. Thirty-five of their family members and closest friends, many of them holding glasses of champagne, gathered under cloudy skies, with Pleasant Mountain as a powerful backdrop across the lake.The groom\u2019s father, William Stucky, who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated, although he admitted to being initially reluctant to fill that role based on his son\u2019s stormy history with Ms. Mathiowetz.\u201cI was both thrilled and challenged when they first asked me to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve worked through their ups and downs and come to a much more mature, adult place inside themselves.\u201dHe led a ceremony rooted in Jewish tradition as the couple signed a traditional marriage contract, said their vows under a tan embroidered tallit, and broke a glass after repeating their vows.Ms. Mathiowetz\u2019s sister, Paige Leitch, said the ceremony was worth the wait.\u201cIt was very happy and a long time coming because they have been hot and cold,\u201d Mrs. Leitch said. \u201cIt was joyous to see it all come together after all the tumultuous lovers\u2019 affairs.\u201dMr. Stucky agreed.\u201cAdrianne and I have a shared sense of comedy and a shared sense of tragedy, and every moment of our life together has been a balance between both,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took us a while to get on the same page in terms of knowing exactly what we wanted from each other, but in the end, we finally got there.\u201dDavid Harry contributed reporting from Bridgton, Me.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Hinckley, Who Tried to Kill Reagan, Will Be Released", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 John W. Hinckley Jr., who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981, will be allowed to live permanently with his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Va., leaving the psychiatric hospital where he has been imprisoned for several decades, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday.Judge Paul L. Friedman of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in his opinion that Mr. Hinckley, 61, no longer posed a danger to himself or others. The release should begin no sooner than Aug. 5, the judge said.Although Mr. Hinckley has been living part time in Williamsburg for years, family and friends of Reagan\u2019s said they were outraged that he would be allowed to reside there permanently.\u201cIf John Hinckley is haunted by anything, I think it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t succeed in his mission to assassinate the president,\u201d Ms. Davis wrote.In a news conference on Wednesday, Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, also denounced the release.\u201cAnd by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Trump said. When someone said that the man\u2019s name was John Hinckley, Mr. Trump corrected himself.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which has consistently opposed Mr. Hinckley\u2019s appeals for greater freedom, said it was reviewing the ruling. A spokeswoman for the Secret Service, which sometimes secretly follows Mr. Hinckley while he is on supervised release, said the agency would not comment.Since 2014, Judge Friedman has allowed Mr. Hinckley to have 17-day stays in Williamsburg, where he has voluntary jobs doing landscaping at a Unitarian church and working in the library and cafeteria of a psychiatric hospital. He has also taken up bowling, attends lectures and outdoor concerts, and exercises regularly at a community center.Mr. Hinckley will have restrictions. He will have to work or volunteer at least three days a week, and if he fails to show up, his absence must be reported to the authorities. He must live with his mother for at least the first year and carry a cellphone that tracks his movements.The judge forbade Mr. Hinckley from speaking to or contacting the news media, and he can drive unaccompanied only within a 30-mile radius of Williamsburg, although he can also drive by himself to monthly hospital appointments in the Washington area.Mr. Hinckley was once psychotic and depressed. After seeing the 1976 film \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d in which a disturbed man plots to assassinate a presidential candidate, he became fixated on Jodie Foster, who played a child prostitute in the film.Mr. Hinckley began to identify with the main character in the film, Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro.After Ms. Foster entered Yale University, Mr. Hinckley moved to New Haven to be close to her and left notes, letters and poems at her dormitory. Failing to win her affections, Mr. Hinckley stalked President Jimmy Carter and was eventually arrested on firearms charges. After the 1980 election, Mr. Hinckley stalked the newly elected President Reagan in an attempt to impress Ms. Foster.Judge Friedman ordered that Mr. Hinckley have no contact with Ms. Foster, or any members of Reagan\u2019s or Mr. Brady\u2019s families, or those of his other victims. He is not allowed to be in the same area as current presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress or other senior members of an administration, and he is not allowed to have Facebook, Twitter or other social media accounts without the unanimous consent of his treatment team.The judge said that if Mr. Hinckley violated the terms of his leave, he could be returned to the hospital.Mr. Hinckley has various physical ailments, including arthritis and high blood pressure. He attempted suicide several times, the last in 1983, but has been largely free of severe mental illness for more than 20 years, according to his doctors.Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was briefly Reagan\u2019s chief of staff, said he was astonished by the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe consequences of trying to kill the leader of the free world should be prison for life,\u201d Mr. Duberstein said.Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said that \u201call Americans should be outraged that it will be just as easy for Jim\u2019s would-be killer to buy a gun today as it was 35 years ago.\u201dMike McPhate contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Broad Movement Against Police Abuse, Some Act on the Fringe", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byThey were members of a group called the People\u2019s New Black Panther Party and they chanted for freedom for black people. They explained that their intent was not to harm police officers but to boldly express their rights to protest and defend themselves.The broad movement against police abuse that has grown over the past two years has drawn a diverse kaleidoscope of activists who are employing an array of tactics. Among those who are praying, blocking roadways, crying out on social media and negotiating with elected officials are a small but fervent few who are channeling the history of militant resistance in America. They are protesting not just with slogans and signs, but also with rifles slung over their shoulders and a rebellious spirit emanating from their throats.Some activists, while distancing themselves from any calls for violence, argue that the movement is only strengthened by its diversity of strategies. No single group, they say, can steer the movement away from its ultimate goal: to end violence against black people and ensure that they gain control over their lives and communities, after being relegated to second-class status for centuries.\u201cAll of those groups are relevant and important to the struggle for black liberation,\u201d said Cat Brooks, an activist who works closely with the Black Lives Matter network. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been liberated, so we don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get there. We need all hands on deck.\u201dThe movement has had varying strains from the beginning, as evidenced by the reaction to the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Peaceful street protests were followed by spontaneous vandalism and looting, which brought widespread attention to the killing and, eventually, deeper problems confronting black communities nationwide.At rallies, there are widespread cries of outrage against the police, for not valuing black lives, and there are also a few protesters who go further, shouting for the deaths of officers.In the crop of activist groups that sprang up after Ferguson, one of the earliest to organize was Lost Voices, a collection of young people with a rebellious edge. They shunned organized street protests and instead opted for tactics like crowding into a business and chanting loudly until it had to close its doors. (But they also protected black businesses from being looted.)\u201cWe want to keep an uproar,\u201d said one of the founders who goes by the name Bud Cuzz, adding that he does not condone violence. \u201cWe\u2019re not just trying to get on Twitter and take pictures and type in stuff that we think sounds good.\u201dMs. Brooks, who is based in Oakland, co-founded the Anti Police-Terror Project three years ago to help get black people involved in their communities. The group, for instance, created a commission of community members who investigate police shootings, support families of victims and pressure departments to hold officers accountable.Yet some fear that the movement against police abuse still has on its periphery some groups with histories of stoking hate.The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist organizations, said it counted 180 groups last year that it considered to be black separatist hate organizations, a 59 percent increase from the previous year.\u201cWhat we think has happened is that along with real civil rights groups and movements like Black Lives Matter, black hate groups also profited quite a bit from all of the attention paid to police violence against black men,\u201d said Mark Potok, a senior fellow with the center. \u201cThey got a huge boost from Ferguson, Trayvon Martin and the rest.\u201dThe New Black Panther Party and the Black Riders Liberation Party, both of which the Dallas gunman, Mr. Johnson, liked on Facebook, are among those that the center considers hate groups.But Babu Omowale, the national minister of defense for the People\u2019s New Black Panther Party, who said the party\u2019s membership has doubled over the past three years, disputed those characterizations.Mr. Omowale conceded that some of the party\u2019s past speech could have been perceived as racist. Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former Nation of Islam member who took over the New Black Panthers in the mid-1990s, \u201cwas hard on white people,\u201d Mr. Omowale said.But Mr. Omowale said that two years ago, he and other members created the People\u2019s New Black Panther Party, an offshoot of the New Black Panthers, which gets away from some of the anti-Zionist and black supremacist speech. Instead, he said, they focused mostly on community activism.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to educate people on police terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to educate people on how the system works.\u201dHe said he considered the party a part of a wider black power movement, not the Black Lives Matter movement. The truth, however, is that the movements are \u201cconnected whether they want to be connected or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the lives of black people who are being murdered around the country unjustifiably by our police departments.\u201dOne crucial difference is that his group advocates armed self-defense, which he said does scare away some people. But the party does not condone violence, he said, and he disavowed the two men who murdered police officers.\u201cThat\u2019s not self-defense,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is an offensive position. We\u2019re for self-defense, meaning if someone puts his hands on you, if someone pulls a gun on you and you have the means to protect yourself, then by all means, you protect yourself.\u201dThe civil rights era saw its share of armed resistance, from the Black Panthers to the Deacons of Defense, which acted as self-defense groups, to the smaller, more underground revolutionary proactive violence groups like the Black Liberation Army.The militancy was born of a history of violence against black people, some African-American academics and activists said, in a country formed by armed rebellion. And with America\u2019s myriad white militias, they said, it would be unfair to single out armed black groups as particularly sinister.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a marginal segment of militant people,\u201d said Ben Ndugga-Kabuye of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, a pro-immigrant and anti-racism organization. \u201cPeople are engaged with each other. There\u2019s a fluidity of people across the movement.\u201dMatt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I want a copy, too, because I know so many middle-aged editors who are angry and, after a drink or two, given to reflection.\u201cQ: How many staffers does it take to change a light bulb at Time Inc.?\u201cA: Twenty-five. One to screw in the new bulb, and 24 to stand around talking about how great the old bulb used to be.\u201dMr. McDonell was a founding editor of Outside magazine in 1977 and since then has had tenures at or near the top of Rolling Stone, Newsweek, Esquire and Sports Illustrated. It would be wrong to say he\u2019s not rueful about the withering of legacy publications.At Sports Illustrated, where he became the eighth managing editor in 2002, he \u201celiminated too many jobs to count,\u201d he writes. Slashing costs and watching serious writers take buyouts felt \u201clike a great library was burning down.\u201dBut \u201cThe Accidental Life\u201d is by and large a fond book. It\u2019s a fan\u2019s notes from a man who, before the apocalypse, edited and often befriended many of his literary heroes, including Edward Abbey, Thomas McGuane, Hunter S. Thompson, Peter Matthiessen, Kurt Vonnegut, James Salter, Jim Harrison, George Plimpton and Richard Ford.Mr. McDonell, now 71, played touch football and ate oysters with Salter; he golfed while on LSD with Thompson and Plimpton; he canoed and drank with Matthiessen; and helped explode an uptight dinner party alongside Abbey. There are many similar anecdotes here, most of them mild.Don\u2019t come to \u201cThe Accidental Life\u201d looking for score-settling or acid gossip. Mr. McDonell is writing about his friends. He isn\u2019t opening his vault or baring his soul.These tendencies speak well of Mr. McDonell as a human being, but they have their drawbacks for the reader. This memoir is also light on female personages. Mr. McDonell edited a lot of men\u2019s magazines. His memoir can seem to be covered with a pelt of tawny chest hair.His insistence on keeping the focus on his writers rather than himself has a humble appeal. But here, too, something small but real is missing. We get tantalizing glimpses of his life. He grew up in Northern California, where his mother moved after his father died in World War II. As an adolescent, he ran wild in what sounds like James Dean fashion.In college at Berkeley, younger students paid him to take their SATs for them. He was an activist in Students for a Democratic Society. His college roommate one year was Steve Lambrecht, who became, Mr. McDonell writes, \u201cZonker of Kesey\u2019s Merry Pranksters, the suave stoner portrayed in Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u2018The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\u2019 as getting \u2018higher than any man alive.\u2019\u201dI\u2019ve barely condensed the personal details above. That\u2019s about all he says on these topics. I\u2019d have read a great deal more about all of it.In Manhattan, Mr. McDonell stood out. Art Cooper, a longtime editor of GQ, once called him \u201cMontana-cowboy-hippie-poet weird.\u201d He wore cowboy boots in the office. He fit right in at Mr. McGuane\u2019s parties in Montana, where, he writes, \u201cMen in boots and hats were smoking in the moonlight with sophisticated women.\u201dHe evokes the magazine-world heyday of lavish offices, drinks carts in the evening and expense-account hedonism. Cocaine was cut with an art director\u2019s X-ACTO blade. A short stack of photographic slides, rarely seen any longer, \u201cfelt good in your hand, like poker chips.\u201dSome of the details he provides will make freelance writers scream. (I screamed, and I rarely write freelance any longer.) Big publishing companies, he admits, \u201cstring out freelance payment as a matter of policy. This is \u2018the float\u2019 bankers talk about.\u201d Your check, in other words, is still not in the mail.As an editor, Mr. McDonell\u2019s philosophy was \u201cAvoid sameness, shun formula, let it rip.\u201d I can\u2019t say he\u2019s entirely done these things in his memoir. But \u201cThe Accidental Life\u201d is intelligent, entertaining and chivalrous.

{"Headline": "An Olympic Odyssey: Where the Games Began", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "A road trip in Greece back in time nearly 3,000 years to the precursors of the modern Olympic Games. Plato sweated here.Supported bySome dream of going to the Olympics. I\u2019d long dreamed of going to Olympia. I wanted to take a solo road trip like no other, searching for the four sites of the ancient Greek athletic games \u2014 Isthmia, Nemea, Delphi and Olympia \u2014 precursors to the Olympics spectacle opening in Rio on Aug. 5.Collectively known as the Panhellenic Games, they were open to athletes across the Greek empire, but Olympia\u2019s festival was always the most prestigious. The first to be established (in 776 B.C.) and the last to go (abolished in A.D. 393 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, a Christian who deemed them pagan rituals), the games at Olympia took place every four years \u2014 this was one way the Greeks measured time \u2014 with the other three held in the interval.I could picture herculean athletes hurling the discus, boxing, wrestling or chariot-racing to take home the top prize, a simple crown \u2014 olive branches at Olympia, laurel at Delphi, wild celery at Nemea and pine at Isthmia. Such figures are depicted on ancient vases and vessels, in statuary and, nowadays, in recreated scenes on History Channel specials.But what do the sites for these games look like now, what condition are they in, and how would I get to them? As a lifelong exercise fanatic, this would be my personal pilgrimage to the birthplace of athletic competition.I sketched out my route in Rome over a beer in a bar on the Gianicolo, the hill next to the Vatican with a sweeping view of the city across the Tiber River. As a visiting scholar at the American Academy in Rome, I\u2019d met a young archaeologist for drinks. Leigh told me how to get where I wanted to go, which was, in a sense, back in time nearly 3,000 years.I went on to Athens in mid-June and spent two days seeing the sights before hitting the road. I got a great deal at Hertz on a \u201csupermini\u201d Ibiza with one major drawback \u2014 a stick shift. I hadn\u2019t driven a stick in 40 years, but no cars with automatic transmissions were available. My rental also didn\u2019t come with GPS, but I convinced myself that everything would be fine. I\u2019d go old school, relying on maps, my inner compass and, if needed, locals for directions. At least the air-conditioning worked. It was a blazing 90-plus degrees.Practicing with the stick shift in the Hertz lot wasn\u2019t pretty, but once I had the basics down, the car was soon flying west on the broad national highway. Within an hour I began spotting signs for Isthmia \u2014 so named for being on the Isthmus of Corinth, which connects Greece\u2019s mainland with Peloponnese, the peninsula to the south.I\u2019d chosen to visit Isthmia first for one reason: It was closest to Athens. (After this, I planned to travel in a loop over the next five days, ending up back in Athens.) Yet, finding no signs for the ruins, I stopped at a roadside gas station. The clerk, an older woman in a bib apron, spoke little English, so I showed her the spot on a map. Pointing out the window, she exclaimed, \u201cStreet? Yes!\u201d Pause. \u201cBridge? Yes!\u201d We then locked eyes and she made the sound \u201cPoof,\u201d like a magician pulling a rabbit from a hat: \u201cNow, Isthmia!\u201dIt was essentially just down the block, and I found it in minutes. What I didn\u2019t find were crowds, lines, vendors \u2014 the trappings of tourism. There was no one else there except a ticket clerk and two burly security guards inside the site\u2019s small, informative historical museum. I bought a ticket and stepped outside to survey the grounds.While historians cannot say with certainty how large the site of the Isthmian Games had been at its height, when it featured an imposing shrine to the god Poseidon (plundered and destroyed by the fifth century A.D.), it would have extended far beyond the few hundred meters first cleared there by archaeologists in the 1950s.I stayed in Isthmia for a good hour, then got back on the road. I had to get to Nemea by 1 p.m. I had made an appointment with the distinguished archaeologist responsible for the Nemean excavations for more than 35 years, Stephen G. Miller, now a retired professor of classical archaeology at the University of California, Berkeley. He had one hour to spare.The trip from Isthmia to Nemea went smoothly, if you don\u2019t count a missed exit and some frantic backtracking. After about 45 minutes on the highway, I followed rural roads curving through vineyards redolent of sweet wine. I made it in time, barely, and found Dr. Miller waiting at the entrance to one of the two digs. As at Isthmia, I was the only visitor. Dr. Miller, a bearded, sturdily built fellow in his early 70s, shook my hand, then briskly strode ahead while beginning a history of the excavations. Stopping suddenly, he announced, \u201cWe are now in the locker room.\u201dI looked about: Nine sand-colored Doric columns in varying heights stood majestically on ground that was as even and as smooth as a gym floor (originally, it had a roof as well). \u201cThen this is the most beautiful locker room I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d I whispered, for I felt as if I were in a truly sacred place. And, in fact, sites like these were far more than athletic fields \u2014 they held deep religious significance for the Greeks, who dedicated the games and individual victories to their deities.Here in the locker room (apodyterion from the ancient Greek), athletes stripped and rubbed their bodies with olive oil and dust, which functioned as both a natural sunscreen and, not incidentally, an enhancer of muscular male beauty. As at all the athletic festivals, they\u2019d compete in the buff. (This was also true at public gymnasiums throughout the empire, where men assembled in the nude to exercise; the word gymnasium comes from the Greek word for naked.)After competing, athletes returned to the locker room to scrape the oil and sweat from their bodies with an instrument made for this purpose, a strigil. This funky goop, called gloios and thought to contain the essence of arete \u2014 valor, excellence \u2014 was often funneled into small vials and sold at gyms for medicinal purposes.Dr. Miller led me farther back to a \u201csecret entrance\u201d from the locker room to the stadium \u2014 a tunnel over 100 feet long with a remarkable vaulted ceiling. Naked men huddled here waiting for their names to be called, and evidence remained that the games were not the only thing on their minds in this steamy atmosphere. Dr. Miller pointed to surviving ancient graffiti with a name carved into the wall: \u201cAkrotatos is beautiful,\u201d he translated from the Greek.\u201cSo, this is one young man complimenting another \u2014 a guy named Akrotatos?,\u201d I asked.\u201cOf course. Women were barred from competing or even watching the games.\u201d As I reminded myself, too, sexual relations between men in ancient Greece were not the taboo they would become with the rise of Christianity.Exiting the dim tunnel into the bright open-air stadium, I thought how thrilling this must have been for the athletes filing out. I could almost hear the fanfare played and the echo of cheering crowds from two millenniums ago. The stadium, twice as long as a football field, had been excavated to nearly pristine condition by Dr. Miller and his teams of colleagues and students, Greek and American.The running track\u2019s original granite starting blocks remained firmly planted; holes drilled into them once held poles threaded with cord across the whole track to prevent false starts; a dozen runners at a time shot off from here. Shallow ditches running alongside the track provided water from an aqueduct to wet the track down between events \u2014 foot races and field events like the javelin \u2014 as well as drinking water for the athletes.Wrestling, boxing and the bloody ancient equivalent to mixed martial arts, pankration, were also held there. Spectators (dressed in variations on a toga and sandals) sat on the gently sloping hillsides \u2014 several thousand men could be accommodated. And at the end of the track, evidence remained of a platform for a panel of 10 judges, who, in the event of what we would now call a photo-finish, arbitrated who would go home the winner. Unlike today\u2019s Olympics, with its bronze and silver medals, second and third places were not recognized in the games of antiquity.From here, Dr. Miller suggested we go to the second Nemean site, a quarter-mile down the road, so we each hopped into our cars. Suddenly, I heard a loud bang, then had a feeling of being shoved hard. I saw in the rearview mirror that the back window was shattered, as if shot out. But no, in my haste I\u2019d shifted into reverse, not first gear, crashing straight into an olive tree.Dr. Miller pulled up beside me. \u201cI\u2019ve done that twice over the years,\u201d he called out. \u201cThat damn tree \u2014 welcome to the club!\u201d He chuckled and peeled off. The hatchback was banged in but the car worked, so I drove down the hill, shaken yet determined not to miss anything.Dr. Miller gave me a tour of the reconstructed Temple of Zeus \u2014 a fourth-century B.C. shrine where religious rites were performed, animals sacrificed \u2014 then he had to depart. And there I was, basically on my own in the middle of nowhere.One of my sisters, a travel agent, had urged me to buy all possible car and travel insurance beforehand. After I placed a call to Hertz, they offered to have a replacement waiting in Nafplio, a seaside town where I had arranged to spend the night (I\u2019d have to pay only a $100 deductible). There was no need for air-conditioning on the hourlong drive to Nafplio since the entire back window was open to the cloudless skies.As promised, a new car awaited at my charming, family-run hotel, the Victoria. The next morning, the desk clerk drew me a map of the route from Nafplio to Olympia, the third site on my journey. I would essentially traverse mountainous central Peloponnese, east to west. He said the drive would take maybe two hours. He also said he\u2019d never done it before.Eight hours later, I pulled into Olympia. I\u2019d made one detour on purpose (to see the remains of the ancient civilization at Mycenae, dating back nearly 4,000 years) and several more that would more accurately be called mistakes. (Road signs in Greek didn\u2019t help.) But I didn\u2019t care; I had no cares. The drive through the Mainalo Mountains in the heart of Arcadia was magnificent, albeit unnerving.I sweated through my T-shirt as the narrow road wound around blind curves for miles and tunneled through a tree-covered mountainside. Stopping for lunch at Platanos Cafe in the tiny village of Langadia, nestled high up on a cliff, was a highlight of the day.When I finally reached Olympia, I found the main street blocked, with traffic at a standstill. Had there been an accident? I parked on a side street and walked toward the small town center, which had the feel of a pleasant but generic outdoor shopping mall. A crowd had converged around a jewelry store with broken windows, shattered glass on the sidewalk, police everywhere. A man told me that \u201cbandits\u201d had robbed it at gunpoint, grabbing jewelry from the storefront windows, just 15 minutes earlier. \u201cPeople will do anything for money now in this country,\u201d he scoffed.How sad to be thrust back into the 21st century. I left the scene and found my way to the Olympia site. By now, it was 6 p.m. The site would remain open another two hours. This was a perfect time to go. The tour buses had left, and I found it empty except for 15 or 20 people. It was magically beautiful at dusk, the light of the low sun like liquid gold beaming through the cypress trees.I visited the remains of the gymnasium; the stadium (similar to Nemea\u2019s but larger, accommodating 45,000 spectators); and the palestra (a wrestling arena) \u2014 all constructed from native stone. Remarkably, large chunks of the foundations and many lychen-encrusted columns still stand. Though the events held at all four sites were generally the same, one crucial factor made the Olympic Games at this site the ultimate Tough Mudder: These athletes were required to train together for 30 days immediately before the contests\u2019 start and, furthermore, had to pledge that they\u2019d trained for a minimum of 10 months every year (financial support from their hometowns made this feasible).The pregame training was considered harder than the games, in part because athletes were not divided into weight categories \u2014 a welterweight might find himself on the other side of a heavyweight\u2019s fist, for instance; similarly with wrestlers. The net effect was to weed out less accomplished athletes, leaving the best of the best for Olympia, as well as the toughest coaches. In at least one recorded instance, a coach was so relentless he trained an athlete to his death.Leaving Olympia the next day for Delphi, I had a sense of freedom that I think of now as \u201cbeing in fifth gear,\u201d the feeling, both literal and figurative, one has while cruising at top speed on a stretch of empty road. I stopped once to cool off by skinny dipping at a deserted beach, inspired, I suppose, by all those naked ancient athletes I\u2019d been contemplating (swimming, incidentally, was never a competitive event in the games of antiquity); and stopped another time to get fuel and directions just before crossing the stunning new Rio-Antirrio Bridge, with its distinctive white, fan-shaped cable supports. The bridge connects northern Peloponnese back to the mainland. I commented to the gas station attendant on how impressive it looked from there.The young man shook his head in disgust. \u201cYes, but \u2014 we are hungry here. That bridge, it\u2019s \u2026 false.\u201d By this, I gathered he meant it\u2019s a sham that this financially troubled country could ill afford \u2014 a big spectacle, not unlike the exorbitant, overdesigned arenas and \u201cvillages\u201d built for the modern Olympic Games.My itinerary had been dictated by geography \u2014 the fastest way to drive from one site to another \u2014 but it turned out there was an accidental logic to it. The sites had gotten more and more spectacular with each stop. Pulling into Delphi, where I would stay two nights, I realized that I\u2019d saved the best for last.Tucked into the southwestern spur of Mount Parnassus, Delphi overlooks the Gulf of Corinth and a velvety-looking valley blanketed with olive orchards. It was too late in the day to visit the site, but I caught a peek \u2014 breathtaking, as it had been carved out of the looming mountainside.According to myth, the god Apollo started these games at Delphi after killing Python, the dragon living there; hence, they were named the Pythian Games in recognition of this act. During the Pythian Games, a competition in music and dance was held at the same time as the athletic contests, an ancient equivalent to \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d cum \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d For this, a 5,000-seat amphitheater had been constructed.I dined that night in the pretty nearby seaport of Galaxidi, and arrived back at the site first thing the next morning. I slathered on sunblock before heading in \u2014 which is to say, up, for seeing the Pythian ruins would involve a fairly steep hike up the mountainside. Even at this early hour, the place was crowded with hundreds more tourists than the others I\u2019d visited.I took my time walking toward the first major monument, the Temple of Apollo, as scores of visitors scurried past. The temple was so large it made the locker room at Nemea seem like a delicate miniature. I found it hard to conceive how this had been built some 2,500 years ago. Slave labor is the short answer, but something more, something mysterious in its decayed beauty, was also at play. Here at this temple was where the Oracle of Delphi resided \u2014 this was not myth. She \u2014 and it was always a she, a priestess \u2014 would inhale fumes rising from a crack in the earth (likely, ethylene emitting from faults in the ground below), which reputedly put her into a trance, in which she would prophesy events of the future.Even an oracle could never predict how amazing a life can be, it struck me \u2014 all the unlikely places that travels can take one. I felt fortunate to have made it to all four sites, as I\u2019d hoped. As I began my ascent to the open-air theater and, farther up, the stadium, I recalled my favorite lines by Pindar, the fifth-century B.C. poet whose odes celebrated the heroic athletes who competed at Isthmia, Nemea, Delphi and Olympia:He who has achieved a new successbasks in the light,soaring from hope to hope.His deeds of prowesslet him pace the air,while he conceivesRent a car to travel directly to all four sites of the ancient games. International Driving Permit recommended (via AAA). Plan on spending at least three to fourdays on the road \u2014 more, if you have time to explore other ancient sites (e.g., Mycenae, Epidaurus, Sparta) and towns along the way (Nafplio, Galaxidi). While Olympia and Delphi \u2014 Unesco World Heritage sites \u2014 are well-appointed tourist stops, Isthmia and Nemea are more off the beaten track. Check opening and closing times; they change depending on time of year.An article on July 24 about the ancient Greek games misstated when Plato competed in the Isthmian Games. It was the late fifth century B.C., not the early fifth century. And an accompanying article misspelled part of the web address for one of the games\u2019 original sites, Nemea. It is nemeacenter.berkeley.edu (not berkely).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kashmir, and the Inheritance of Loss", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSRINAGAR, Kashmir \u2014 On July 8, Burhan Wani, a 22-year-old rebel, was shot dead by Indian soldiers and police officers in a small village in the central part of Indian-controlled Kashmir. News of his killing spread as fast as the bullets that had hit him. Cellphones, emails, social media went wild: \u201cThey\u2019ve killed Burhan! They\u2019ve killed Burhan!\u201d Everybody called Burhan by his first name.A dozen boys with a few guns \u2014 they were no threat to the Indian army, one of the largest in the world. There is no record of Burhan and his crew waging any attack. Their rebellion was symbolic, a war of images against India\u2019s continuing occupation of Kashmir, where about half a million of its soldiers, paramilitary and armed police are still stationed.According to top police officials, Burhan and two other militants were killed on the evening of July 8 in a gun battle that broke out after Indian soldiers and Kashmiri police surrounded the house in which they had sought shelter.When I first saw the photos of Burhan and his boys, I thought: another generation of young Kashmiris about to be consumed. Those apple orchards and mountains in the background, which I know intimately and call home, brought back memories of the early \u201990s, when I was a teenager in southern Kashmir. An armed insurgency supported by Pakistan and a popular rebellion were underway then, triggered by the Indian government\u2019s meddling in a recent state election.By the time the insurgency was quashed in the late 2000s, more than 70,000 militants, soldiers and civilians had been killed. Still, hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris would occasionally take to the streets. Indian troops continued to respond with violence, even against civilians armed with nothing or nothing more than stones. Hardly any soldier has been prosecuted for civilian killings because Indian law has long granted immunity to troops posted in Kashmir and other troubled regions. (A recent decision by India\u2019s Supreme Court may change this.)As Kashmiris seethed with desperate anger that day, Indian paramilitaries and police were deployed across the region. In hundreds of locations, people came out to mourn Burhan and raise their voices against the Indian occupation. The vast majority were unarmed. In some places, protesters picked up stones and charged at camps of Indian soldiers and police.The troops responded with a brutality rare even by the grim standards of their record in Kashmir. They fired bullets, tear gas and lead pellets. Soon, the Indian government imposed a military curfew.I reached Kashmir from Delhi on July 11, and the next morning when I woke up in my parents\u2019 house in southern Srinagar, I heard only crickets chirping in the backyard. The streets were desolate except for groups of Indian paramilitary troops with guns and bamboo sticks. The pro-India politicians who run the Kashmir government had all but disappeared from public view.Kashmiris, as they do in crisis, turned to themselves for support. At Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) Hospital in central Srinagar, where the injured had been brought by the hundreds, scores of volunteers were offering medicine, money, clothes and care to the patients and their families. On one wall in the lobby hung a banner with the words, \u201cThe Martyrs Ask of You: Remember Us,\u201d and two photographs of Burhan. One showed him standing against a mountainous backdrop; the other was of his bullet-ridden corpse on a stretcher.I walked into an ophthalmology ward. There were about 20 beds with a teenager or young man in each and relatives standing around in anxious huddles. Almost every patient had large, black sunglasses. \u201cSeventy-two patients with pellet injuries arrived here in one day,\u201d one doctor told me. As of Sunday, SMHS Hospital alone had received more than 180 people with serious wounds to the eyes.A single shot from a pellet gun sprays more than a hundred pellets. A pellet is a high-velocity projectile 2mm to 4mm around and with sharp edges. It doesn\u2019t simply penetrate an eye; it ricochets inside it, tearing the retina and the optic nerves, scooping out flesh and bone.I walked through the hospital with Dr. Javed Shafi, a surgeon in his early 40s, as he was making bed calls with his patients.The day before he had operated on Shafia Jan, a pale, slim woman in her mid-20s from Arwani, a village about 50 miles south. She had stepped out of her house after hearing commotion on the street during protests following Burhan\u2019s death, she explained. A police officer fired his pump-action gun toward her.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything at first. Then, my left leg crumbled and I fell. I saw my intestines falling out,\u201d Ms. Jan told me. She pushed her guts back into the wound and held them in with her hands. Scores of pellets had pierced her lower abdomen, opening up the scars of an earlier C-section.Omar Nazir, a reed-thin boy of 12, barely filled one corner of his bed. A thick swathe of bandages formed a cross across his chest and belly. He had black, adult-size glasses. \u201cHe\u2019s lost both his eyes,\u201d Dr. Shafi said. Doctors had yet to deliver the news to Nazir Ahmad, the boy\u2019s father, a day laborer in Pulwama, a district in southern Kashmir, but he already seemed to know. Mr. Ahmad, tall and wiry, looked at the doctor, his eyes liquid with entreaty: \u201cDr. Sahib, we own one-fifth of an acre of land in the village. I will sell all my land, but please make him see.\u201dIn other corners of the hospital: A young man with the face of Adrian Brody whose penis had to be amputated because it had been shredded by pellets. A four-year-old girl, her legs and abdomen riddled by what she called \u201cfirecrackers.\u201d And Insha Malik.I had read about Insha, 14, in that morning\u2019s paper. The photograph accompanying the article showed a face with red wart-like wounds. Her nasal bridge was a lump of raw flesh held together by black surgical thread. The bloodied lids of her left eye had been sown shut. Her right eye was a red alloy of blood, flesh, bone and metal.Insha was in the surgical intensive care unit of SMHS Hospital, a few rooms away from the ward I visited with Dr. Shafi. Afroza Malik, her mother, a woman in her early 50s, sat right by the I.C.U. door on the bare floor. Her husband, who had a leg injury from an earlier accident, was lying on a blanket, his head in his wife\u2019s lap. She was stroking his graying hair.Ms. Malik explained that on July 12, she, Insha and several relatives had taken refuge in an upstairs room of their two-story house in Sedew, a tiny village 40 miles south of Srinagar. They closed the thick wooden windows and sat on the floor. They heard tear gas canisters being fired; they heard gunshots. A loud noise followed. A pellet gun had been fired at the window. Insha was sitting nearby. \u201cThe window was blown to pieces,\u201d Ms. Malik told me. \u201cI heard her wail and saw blood flowing out of her eyes. She fell on the floor.\u201dA few days later, the police raided the offices of Greater Kashmir, the daily that had run that story about Insha, as well as several other local newspapers, and shut down the printing presses. The authorities\u2019 familiar silencing routine had begun again. Indian officials and thought leaders fell back on tired rituals of obfuscation and denial. But already one line of graffiti had appeared on every other wall throughout the entire valley: \u201cGo India, Go Back!\u201dBasharat Peer is the author of \u201cCurfewed Night,\u201d a memoir of the conflict in Kashmir, and the forthcoming, \u201cA Question of Order: India, Turkey and the Return of Strongmen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is a position that the company has long jockeyed to be in as it seeks to keep its 1.65 billion members ever more engaged.Yet the brutal nature of the events that appeared on Facebook Live also put the company in a tricky situation.\u201cThere are a handful of companies at the moment in a position to offer a live-streaming service where individual broadcasts are easily discoverable and shareable,\u201d said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a law and computer science professor at Harvard University. \u201cIt just puts companies in positions they weren\u2019t designed to deal with well.\u201dOn Friday, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company understood the \u201cunique challenges of live video\u201d and the importance of having \u201ca responsible approach.\u201d It does not cross a line when someone who witnesses a shooting uses Facebook Live to raise awareness or find the perpetrator, she said, but if that video was used for mocking or celebratory purposes, then it would be removed.Anyone in the United States with a Facebook account and a smartphone can begin live streaming. The video is instantly broadcast to the person\u2019s news feed where friends and followers can immediately view the video.Facebook said the service follows its community guidelines, which outline what the company permits on the site. Under the guidelines, Facebook largely relies on its members to identify and take down inappropriate content.Flagged material is sent to a team of Facebook employees, who can take some actions, including interrupting an inappropriate live stream or calling local law enforcement in the case of a dangerous or illegal event. Facebook said it can also add warnings to graphic videos after they are recorded \u2014 as it did with Ms. Reynolds\u2019s video \u2014 and is able to restrict graphic videos to users over 18 years old.Those conventions are similar to guidelines set by other websites that host user-generated content, such as Reddit and Twitter\u2019s Periscope.Bruce Shapiro, the executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said companies with live-streaming and large audiences have a responsibility to inform the public and its users about potential repercussions.\u201cCompanies and platforms are going to have to educate people about how their videos are going to have a big impact,\u201d he said.Facebook is racing to catch up to, and ultimately surpass, Twitter. Twitter was key in distributing news and images from the social unrest that unfolded in Ferguson, Mo., starting in 2014.\u201cIt does feel like a critical point, a tipping point, in the public\u2019s ability to both use and respond to live, eyewitness media,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Sydney Ember from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

This is an American issue that we all should care about.\u201dA few hours earlier, Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, who seemed shaken by the video showing the man, Philando Castile, as he died, also pointed to the role of race. \u201cWould this have happened if the driver were white, if the passengers were white?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have.\u201dBut the department responded that for now, it would leave the investigation to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and would offer assistance.The shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota follow a long string of deaths of black people at the hands of the police \u2014 in Staten Island; Cleveland; Baltimore; Ferguson, Mo.; and North Charleston, S.C., among others \u2014 that have stoked outrage around the country. The encounters, many of them at least partly caught on video, have led to intense debate about race relations and law enforcement.The president cited the nation\u2019s tortured racial history and current statistics on unequal treatment of the races. Sounding wistful, he said, \u201cmaybe in my children\u2019s lifetimes, all the vestiges of that past will have been cured.\u201dMr. Castile\u2019s deadly encounter with the police occurred Wednesday night at 9 p.m., in the small city of Falcon Heights, just northwest of St. Paul. The graphic video showed Mr. Castile, who had been shot several times, slumping toward the woman who was recording the scene. As she did so, her 4-year-old daughter sat in the back seat and an officer stood just outside the driver\u2019s side window, still aiming his gun at the mortally wounded man at point-blank range.\u201cPlease, Officer, don\u2019t tell me that you just did this to him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.\u201dMs. Reynolds\u2019s daughter appears several times in the video. Near the end of the 10-minute clip, as the two are sitting in the back of a police car and Ms. Reynolds becomes increasingly distraught, the girl comforts her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K., Mommy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. I\u2019m right here with you.\u201dLate Thursday night, Minnesota authorities identified the officer who fired as Jeronimo Yanez. They said he is on administrative leave as the investigation continues. Another officer who did not shoot but was on the scene is also on leave.The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s office ruled Mr. Castile\u2019s manner of death to be a homicide, meaning he was killed by another person.In a short statement, the medical examiner said Mr. Castile sustained multiple gunshot wounds and died at 9:37 p.m. in a hospital emergency room, about 20 minutes after he was shot.\u201cHe was one of the softest-spoken people you\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Antonio Johnson, a first cousin of Mr. Castile\u2019s. \u201cThis kid has never been in an argument. You could try to argue with him, and he was so nonconfrontational that he\u2019d just laugh.\u201dDanny Givens, a nondenominational pastor who said he was a friend of Mr. Castile\u2019s, said, \u201cPhilando was a very even-keeled man, good-hearted, personable, smile would light up a room, eyes that just speak volumes of love.\u201dIn its statement, the school district said: \u201cHe had a cheerful disposition and his colleagues enjoyed working with him. He was quick to greet former co-workers with a smile and hug.\u201dIn the day after the shooting, Ms. Reynolds and her video supplied the only public accounts of the lethal encounter. Officials said they could not offer any details, though they did confirm that a gun \u2014 presumably Mr. Castile\u2019s \u2014 was recovered from the scene.Mona Dohman, the state commissioner of public safety, who oversees the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, declined to say whether Mr. Castile had a permit to carry a concealed firearm.Mr. Dayton said he was struck by the fact that the video did not show officers making any attempt to render first aid to the dying man, but that they handcuffed Ms. Reynolds and placed her and her daughter in the back of a police car. \u201cThe stark treatment I find just absolutely appalling at all levels,\u201d he said.The video of the shooting passed rapidly among Twitter, Facebook and YouTube users, becoming significant news online. The terms #FalconHeightsShooting and #PhilandoCastile were trending on Twitter as news of the encounter spread.Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Ms. Reynolds said that Mr. Castile, had just come from having his hair done for his birthday when they were pulled over on Larpenteur Avenue, a major thoroughfare through Falcon Heights, a predominantly white and middle-class city of 5,500 residents. The two officers who stopped them were from the nearby city of St. Anthony, which provides police services under contract to Falcon Heights, One officer approached Mr. Castile, who was driving, and said he had a broken taillight, Ms. Reynolds said.\u201cHe tells us to put our hands in the air, we have our hands in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time as our hands is in the air, he asked for license and registration,\u201d which Mr. Castile carried in a wallet in his back pocket.As he is reaching for his back pocket wallet, to produce his license and registration, \u201che lets the officer know, \u2018Officer, I have a firearm on me,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI began to yell, \u2018But he\u2019s licensed to carry.\u2019 After that, he began to take off shots \u2014 bah, bah, bah, bah, \u2018Don\u2019t move! Don\u2019t move!\u2019 But how can you not move when you\u2019re asking for license and registration? It\u2019s either you want my hands in the air or you want my identification.\u201dThe video, some versions of which were reversed, making it appear that Mr. Castile was in the passenger seat, begins with images of Mr. Castile, who appears to be moaning and moving slightly, his left arm and left side bloody. Ms. Reynolds, who uses the name Lavish Reynolds on Facebook, then pans the camera to her face and says matter-of-factly, \u201cThey killed my boyfriend.\u201d In the background, one of the officers can be heard shouting: \u201cI told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hands up.\u201dMr. Castile\u2019s mother, Valerie Castile, told CNN that she had taught her son to be extremely cautious when encountering members of law enforcement. \u201cIf you get stopped by the police, comply,\u201d Ms. Castile said. \u201cComply, comply, comply.\u201dShe added, \u201cI think he was just black in the wrong place.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described the beginning of the video shot in Falcon Heights, Minn.

No charging decision was announced for one juvenile arrested during the protest.Separately, county prosecutors charged one man with felony second-degree riot and accused of him of throwing rocks and construction debris at officers during the highway shutdown.And in Baton Rouge, law enforcement officials defended themselves from criticism over their response to protests over the weekend when over 180 people were arrested.The chief has said that during the standoff inside El Centro College, Mr. Johnson, who was black, told police negotiators that he specifically wanted to kill white officers. His Facebook page indicated support for black militant groups that have advocated violence against white people.Chief Brown said that since the shootings, officers nationwide were on edge about angry or unstable people \u201cwho could do grave damage to us,\u201d and revealed that he had received a death threat delivered to the department\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cThere is a heightened sense of awareness around threats we\u2019ve received all over the country,\u201d he said.The police investigation in Dallas is enormous in scope, and Chief Brown said that until it was completed, he could not say definitively what law enforcement officials now believe: that Mr. Johnson acted alone. Detectives are poring over 170 hours of video taken by officers\u2019 body cameras, he said, and \u201ccountless hours\u201d of video from police dashboard cameras, security cameras at local businesses and more than 300 witness interviews.President Obama, who cut short a trip to Europe after the shooting, plans to visit Dallas on Tuesday and to attend a memorial service for the fallen officers. Chief Brown said he had enlisted surrounding police agencies to provide security for the president\u2019s visit, not wanting to put that added burden on his fatigued officers.On Monday, the president joined a meeting between law enforcement officials and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and he plans to meet at the White House on Wednesday with law enforcement officials, civil rights activists and others to discuss ways to improve relations between minority communities and the police.Funerals for the officers will begin on Wednesday, and Chief Brown said attending them was \u201cgoing to be the most challenging thing in my life.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to anybody to make anything better; I didn\u2019t see it coming,\u201d said the father, James Johnson. \u201cI loved my son, all my heart. I hate what he did.\u201dThe attacker\u2019s mother, Delphine Johnson, said that the military \u201cwas not what Micah thought it would be,\u201d and that her son, who served for several months in Afghanistan and had wanted to be a police officer when he was a boy, was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with his experience in the service.In a written summary of the interview, which is to be broadcast this week, The Blaze reported that Micah Johnson, according to his parents, had \u201cdisplayed a noticeable change in behavior\u201d after his discharge in 2015. Ms. Johnson said that her son had transformed from an extrovert into a \u201chermit\u201d after serving in the military.After his discharge, Mr. Johnson began studying black history in depth, his father said. But members of his family told the news agency that he had never shown signs of animosity toward whites or other races.At Parkland Hospital, doctors held an emotional news conference on Monday, recounting their experiences treating seven officers on Thursday night, including some who did not survive.\u201cThat I was unable to save those cops when they came here that night, it weighs on my mind constantly,\u201d said Dr. Brian E. Williams, a trauma surgeon.His voice breaking, Dr. Williams, who is black, said he was deeply hurt by both the deaths of black people in police custody, and by violence aimed against the police. \u201cBlack men dying and being forgotten, people retaliating against the people that are sworn to defend us \u2014 we have to come together and end all this,\u201d he said.Officials have said that when it became clear that Mr. Johnson would not surrender peacefully, they killed him with an explosive delivered by a bomb squad robot. Chief Brown defended that move, which has been second-guessed.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an ethical dilemma for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d do it again to save lives.\u201dAlan Blinder and Richard Fausset reported from Dallas, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wichita Police\u2019s Plan to Ease Racial Tension: Barbecue and Dancing", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byA day after Black Lives Matter supporters and protesters shut down streets in Wichita, Kan., amid national turmoil over the recent killings of black civilians and police officers, the city\u2019s police chief faced a pressing question: What could be done to ease tensions?So the chief, Gordon Ramsay, along with protest organizers and other community members, came up with an idea: They would hold a barbecue.Up to 2,000 people gathered on Sunday in McAdams Park, located in a north-side neighborhood with entrenched grievances against the police. Businesses donated hamburgers, hot dogs and grills. Volunteers flipped burgers. Uniformed officers danced the Nae Nae and the Cha-Cha Slide with residents as a D.J. played music from a portable table set up on the grass.\u201cWe are the flash point for incidents related to the disparities when something bad happens, particularly to people of color,\u201d Chief Ramsay said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhen we see protests and riots and a lot of anger toward the police, we need to be part of the solution.\u201dThe Wichita event, called the First Steps Community Cookout, was the first of its kind in Wichita as the police, activists and other residents tried to find common ground to address \u2014 or dance off \u2014 some of the national angst that had been building after recent killings in other cities.He was among the three officers who were shot dead on Sunday.\u201cEvery incident is viewed as a learning opportunity,\u201d he wrote.Chief Ramsay said that four similar events were planned for August, or until school starts, but that they would be smaller social gatherings for residents to become acquainted with their local patrols. Other planned initiatives include developing ideas for a civilian review board for complaints about the police, an independent prosecutor to investigate officer-involved shootings and diversity training.In addition, a \u201cGod Squad\u201d of clergy members would advise the chief about concerns in the community, he said.A. J. Bohannon, a local leader of the advocacy group I.G.Y.B. (for \u201cI got your back\u201d), said in a phone interview that the meeting with the chief was a start. Mr. Bohannon said the party was held in an area where most residents are African-American and unemployment is high.\u201cThere is a huge divide in this city between the community and the police,\u201d Mr. Bohannon said. \u201cIt is not something that is hidden. It is not secret; it is obvious.\u201d\u201cTo get 1,800 people out to that park, in that community,\u201d he added, \u201cand have police officers and people who have issues with them and break bread and dance together, people that have been burning on the inside for years \u2014 we erased some of that doubt and fear.\u201d\u201cThis is the first step to becoming a better community,\u201d he added. \u201cI wish they would do this once a month.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Helping Deport Kids to Die", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byTAPACHULA, Mexico \u2014 Elena was 11 years old when a gang member in her home country, Honduras, told her to be his girlfriend.\u201cI had to say yes,\u201d Elena, now 14, explained. \u201cIf I had said no, they would have killed my entire family.\u201dElena knew the risks because one of her friends, Jenesis, was also asked to be a gang member\u2019s girlfriend, and declined. Elena happened to see the aftermath, as Jenesis staggered naked and bleeding away from gang members.\u201cShe had been raped and shot in the stomach,\u201d Elena recalled in the blank tone of a child who has seen far too much. She paused and then added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she survived. Someone said she died at the hospital.\u201dAs for Elena, she said her duties as a gang member\u2019s girlfriend entailed working as a drug courier and a lookout, as well as intimacies that she didn\u2019t want to discuss. At this point in our conversation, her mother and younger sister began crying.After years of such brutality, Elena and her family finally fled this year when the gang threatened to kill them so as to seize their home. \u201cI just want to keep my children safe,\u201d the mother, Brenda, 39, explained, speaking here where they are staying near the Guatemalan border.Yet they aren\u2019t safe, in part because of a policy backed by President Obama and the Mexican authorities to return vast numbers of desperate refugees to the countries from which they fled. In the last five years, the U.S. and Mexico have returned 800,000 refugees to Central America, including 40,000 children.If other countries were forcibly returning people to their deaths, we would protest. But because we Americans worry about refugees swarming across our borders, we help pay for Mexico to intercept them along its southern border and send them \u2014 even children like Elena \u2014 back home, where they may well be raped or killed.I\u2019m mostly a fan of the Obama administration, but this is just plain immoral.Immigration is among the knottiest of challenges, and there is a real risk that welcoming some children creates an incentive that results in other children endangering their lives by undertaking a perilous journey north.I\u2019m not arguing that the U.S. should open its doors wide to all Central Americans, and Obama in any case is constrained by Congress. But historically, Central Americans had a refuge in southern Mexico, and it is unnecessary and cruel now for the U.S. to take the initiative and work so diligently to cut off that safe haven.One rural farmer, Guillermo, 58, told me that all he and his family had wanted to do was stay on their farm in El Salvador, growing fruits and vegetables. Then two gangs moved in and began taking over the land \u2014 and killing those who got in the way.On a neighboring farm, five people were massacred, including an 8-month-old baby, the baby\u2019s mother and a grandfather visiting from the United States. Then the gang called Guillermo\u2019s daughter, telling the family members to clear out or be slaughtered. They left, with Guillermo grazed by a bullet as he fled, and after a terrifying journey they are now in southern Mexico.I can\u2019t confirm the details of Guillermo\u2019s story, or those of the other refugees I spoke with. But their accounts are consistent and mesh with those of human rights organizations.Another man, Emilio, 23, showed me threats he is still getting from the gangs. Emilio fled El Salvador, leaving his clothing business behind, when gang members barged into his home, held his family at gunpoint and said they would kill his two small children unless he paid protection money. So now Emilio is hiding in Mexico with his wife and two children, and getting death threats.\u201cWe know where you are with your bitch and your kids,\u201d read one Facebook message he received from a gang member. \u201cWe sent the homeboys there, traitor. You understand, for not giving us the money, you four are dead.\u201dNobody knows exactly how many people have been murdered or raped after deportation because of this American-Mexican policy, but there\u2019s no doubt many have been. I heard of one Salvadoran man who was shot by a gang within hours of being deported by Mexico. Indeed, by some accounts, the gangs keep an eye on the buses arriving in San Salvador and unloading deportees, who become sitting ducks.Secretary of State John Kerry rightfully criticized Kenya\u2019s plans to close its Daadab refugee camp and return refugees to Somalia, but the U.S. does something parallel when it works with Mexico to deport refugees to Honduras and El Salvador.I met a 15-year-old boy, Alex, a lawyer\u2019s son from a well-off family, who came to Mexico on his own after a gang tried to recruit him as he went to and from school. Alex was a good student \u2014 his favorite subject was English \u2014 and he politely tried to decline, because the last thing he aspired to become was a gangster.That\u2019s when the gang knifed him in the stomach and broke his nose. After that, Alex didn\u2019t dare attend school any more, and he quickly arranged to take a bus north to safety in Mexico. Except that Mexico may not be safe, because the U.S. is trying to solve a political crisis on our border in ways that only increase the risk to children like Alex.Leer en espa\u00f1ol (Read in Spanish)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS Bombing in Baghdad Casts Doubt on Iraqi Leader\u2019s Ability to Unite", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byAs Sunday gave way to Monday morning, with bodies still buried, some began expressing their grief through politics, waving banners listing the dead and demanding that officials, including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, resign.The attack in a shopping area in the Karada neighborhood was the deadliest in Baghdad in many years, and after the final death toll is known it could become the deadliest ever.As bloody as it was, the bombing in Baghdad was but the worst of a wave of global terrorism in recent days attributed to militants aligned with the Islamic State. Seemingly unconnected to any political purpose and intended to kill indiscriminately, be it by gunfire, explosions or, in the case of a restaurant in Bangladesh, an arsenal including swords, the violence has cut across religions, national identities, ages and professions.In Iraq, the victims were all Iraqis. Desperate to respond to the public\u2019s grief and anger, Mr. Abadi tried to assuage Iraqis\u2019 desire for revenge by promising to speed the executions of Islamic State militants on death row. Later in the day, the Justice Ministry announced that five convicted terrorists had been executed, and images of their hangings were shown on state television.Nevertheless, on Monday morning the police were still using the devices at checkpoints across Baghdad, underscoring how little ever changes, even though Iraq has been consumed by violence for more than a decade. Just this year, through June, nearly 5,000 Iraqi civilians and security force members had been killed by militant attacks and conflict, according to the United Nations.As the Islamic State loses territory, it is shifting to insurgent tactics in Baghdad.Protests have been fairly muted so far, with grief for the dead still the overwhelming emotion for Iraqis. That is affording a bit of breathing space for Mr. Abadi, a Shiite who became prime minister in 2014 with the backing of American officials who believed he could reunite the country in the face of an onslaught by the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State.Still, analysts say, the bombing presents a political challenge. \u201cThis sort of violence can destroy the legitimacy of a leader,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, the Iraq analyst for the International Crisis Group.With faith in his ability to unite the country and protect its citizens shaken, Mr. Abadi is likely to face further calls for his ouster, analysts said. They would also not rule out the possible return of street protesters, who twice this year stormed the fortified Green Zone, the secure area that houses government buildings, and ransacked Parliament.\u201cI think it will be a bad summer,\u201d Ms. Fantappie said of the prospect of further protests.Mr. Abadi has long struggled to secure his power in the face of opposition from other Shiite leaders, including former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Mr. Maliki was pushed out in 2014, partly because Washington believed that he had pursued sectarian policies that alienated the Sunni minority and led to the rise of the Islamic State.Ever since, Mr. Maliki has sought to undermine Mr. Abadi, and in an interview with the BBC just before the bombing, he said he would happily become prime minister again if \u201cthe country needs me.\u201dHakim al-Zamili, a Shiite lawmaker who is the head of Parliament\u2019s Security and Defense Committee, promised an investigation of the bombing and called for the resignations of the officials responsible for securing Baghdad.After the victory in Falluja, optimistic Iraqi officials talked excitedly about marching on Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, which fell to the Islamic State in 2014. But after this latest attack, that operation could be delayed, fulfilling another Islamic State goal. Each time the militant group has lost territory, it has launched attacks in Baghdad, forcing Iraqi officials to concern themselves with security in the capital.The death toll continued to rise on Monday from the attack, which occurred as Iraqis were out enjoying one of the last evenings of the holy month of Ramadan. They had filled the cafes and shops of the area\u2019s malls, buying food and new clothes for Eid al-Fitr, the post-Ramadan celebration, and some were watching Italy and Germany play in the European championship soccer tournament.Officials said Monday afternoon that 155 had been killed and that at least 192 had been wounded. Dozens of people were still unaccounted for, and many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.In its statement claiming responsibility, the Islamic State said it had targeted Shiites. But Karada is a reflection of Baghdad at its multicultural best, with Shiite and Sunni mosques and a smattering of churches. Iraqis of all identities were among the victims.Hundreds of people gathered at Baghdad\u2019s morgue on Monday to try to identify bodies. A morgue worker, Samar Ali, said officials were taking DNA samples from people with missing relatives, in the hope of identifying otherwise unrecognizable bodies, which she said would take at least 16 days.\u201cThe suffering of the families will last for weeks until we are able to identify them,\u201d she said.Iraqis on Monday turned to social media to mourn those they had lost, sharing pictures of loved ones and stories about them. There were many children among the dead, and many young men who were out on the town.Once again, Iraq said goodbye to some of its best and brightest.One of those was Ahmad Dhia, who had two young children and was working to advance Iraq\u2019s agricultural industry, writing research papers on how to improve crop production and working with ministries. His friends and family called his phone for hours on Sunday before his body was finally pulled from the rubble late in the evening.Another was Adel Euro, who had founded a dance academy in Baghdad and was involved in protests last summer demanding the government tackle corruption. He was also affiliated with a New York-based dance company called Battery Dance, which mentored him online and worked with him last year in Amman, Jordan.Falih Hassan reported from Baghdad, and Tim Arango from Beirut, Lebanon.

Now would be a good time to look for an attractive suitor.The slowdown does not bode well for the decade-old company as it fends off nimbler upstarts. Snapchat, for example, managed to increase its daily active users 50 percent year-over-year to 150 million, according to Jefferies. It has become the new darling among advertisers wanting to reach a younger audience. Nearly two-thirds of Snapchat users are between the ages of 18 and 34.Mr. Dorsey, who is also moonlighting as the chief executive of the payment service Square, took charge of Twitter last October and has tried to attract new users. That effort has included rolling out new features (some of them confusing), trying to reposition the brand and \u2014 perhaps more promisingly \u2014 signing deals with sports leagues like the National Football League and the National Hockey League to live-stream video.Verizon\u2019s rationale for its buying spree is to build a network that yokes Yahoo\u2019s strength in sports and finance with AOL properties like Huffington Post and TechCrunch.

During the conflict with Iraq in the 1980s, millions of land mines were buried throughout Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s western border provinces. Despite efforts by government demining programs, an unknown amount of undetonated ordnance still litters the countryside.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been 30 years since the war ended, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still taking lives and hurting the people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arash Khamooshi, a photojournalist from Kurdistan, Iran, who grew up with adults constantly warning him about the countless mines scattered about, even in areas that had been playgrounds. That danger remains ever-present today: each year, more than 100 people are killed or maimed by land mines. Many are adults working around the borders of Kurdistan. Natural phenomena, including rain and landslides, have shifted mines closer to residential areas.In 2013, Mr. Khamooshi learned that six children had been seriously injured after one of them triggered a land mine buried underneath a tree. The incident compelled him to document child victims of land-mine explosions. For the last two and a half years, Mr. Khamooshi has photographed a dozen children under the age of 10 whose lives were altered by land mines. All suffered trauma; some lost limbs, or even their lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese kids had nothing to do with the war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut they are being hurt by the aftermath of that war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He has dual motives for his continuing project. Mr. Khamooshi says he believes the photos will serve as effective warnings, particularly for children. More important, he hopes that bringing attention to these incidents will motivate the government, along with nonprofit organizations, to take necessary steps to make the country safer. Mr. Khamooshi is no stranger to advocacy. In addition to his work for the Iranian Students News Agency, he volunteers in Tehran for Nikgaman Jamshid, a partner of the United States-based nongovernmental organization Moms Against Poverty. The organization builds schools and medical centers in poor and remote villages, so that fewer children will have to trek to neighboring villages along potentially treacherous paths. Many of the children killed or maimed by the blasts in Iran lived in areas with limited access to resources. His photographs depict the young victims, wounded and recovering in hospital beds; some feature close looks at scars and deformities. Others show the children at home, or outside at a favorite playing spot; their injuries and amputations are not prominent, or even visible.Mr. Khamooshi chose black-and-white to mute the graphic impact of blood and minimize the grisliness of certain injuries. Although he wants to raise awareness, he prefers to be restrained in order not to undermine his purpose with disturbing, graphic images. He needs to draw eyes to the horror, not avert them from it, if he hopes to spur change and prevent further tragedy.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen they are disabled like that, it affects their future very deeply,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Khamooshi said of his subjects. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to show that the future for them is destroyed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
{"Headline": "As if Becoming a Vampire Isn\u2019t Bad Enough", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byWe\u2019ll get to how one obtains a supernatural lover in minute. But first: lace crater?Harrison Atkins, who wrote and directed the film, elaborated: \u201cLace is this word associated with traditional femininity that has to do with sexual shame,\u201d he said. \u201cCrater is this word that evokes an impact or an absence left after an impact. I think of the lace crater as this void that\u2019s left in the world after Ruth disappears in it.\u201dA meet-cute comedy mixed with Brooklyn ghost story, \u201cLace Crater,\u201d with an opening date of July 29, is the latest entry in the horror genre\u2019s long fixation on sexually transmitted diseases. Intimacy, illness and stigma have been ingredients of \u201cIt Follows\u201d (2015), about a sexually transmitted condition that draws bloodthirsty stalkers; \u201cContracted\u201d (2013) and its sequel, \u201cContracted: Phase II\u201d (2015), about a flesh-destroying S.T.D.; and \u201cTeeth\u201d (2007), about a man-hungry vagina dentata.And, as in most horror films preoccupied with sex, a woman is the infected protagonist.This new mini-moment of sex-obsessed horror films arrives at a strange time for carnality. Sex in every make and model is arguably more easily accessible \u2014 attainable is another thing \u2014 than ever before. But with no-strings hookups just an app swipe away, where does emotional intimacy fit in? And why is it so scary?\u201cI feel like the movie is somehow reverberative in this texture of sexual shame and mystery that reflects a changing world,\u201d Mr. Atkins said of \u201cLace Crater.\u201d \u201cSex is a huge part of everyone\u2019s life, but it\u2019s the elephant in the room. It\u2019s a teeming terrain for horror movies because there is so much meaning in the way that people on an individual level, and culture more broadly, interface, or not, with sex. When that bubbles over, it makes for a really specific horror situation.\u201d\u201cI thought it would be fascinating to blend that with a movie that\u2019s more cerebral and relationship-based, if Woody Allen made a movie like that,\u201d he said.Like the evil stalkers in \u201cIt Follows,\u201d the diseased ghost in \u201cLace Crater\u201d lives in the real world, not just the supernatural one. Keeping the ghost grounded as a \u201ccharacter who is a person and not,\u201d as Mr. Atkins put it, was a concept that came from his interest in the spectral nature of social media.\u201cThe alienation of the internet and the way that technology is forcing people to re-establish identities on these different terrains: There\u2019s something that feels like gut-level horror about those ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can encounter a friend who has died but whose Facebook is still active, and that is the most perfect parallel to a ghost that has ever existed. There\u2019s this version of an identity that is haunting this space after someone has died.\u201dHorror movies about sex and its accursed consequences have shape-shifted symbolically since Bela Lugosi\u2019s teeth penetrated Helen Chandler\u2019s neck in the 1931 \u201cDracula.\u201d (Vampirism, with its themes of seduction and curse transmission, is the granddaddy of sex horror.) During the sexual revolutions of the 1960s and \u201970s, sex spawned Satan (\u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d) and body terror (\u201cShivers\u201d). The conservatism of the \u201980s produced slasher films like \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d in which the horniest couples got the ax first, and the virgin was the final girl. (AIDS, a horror itself in the \u201980s, has mostly remained a hands-off topic in the genre.) In post-9/11 America, horror dove into torture porn, with its punishing kink symbolism.Sean Abley, who has written about horror for Fangoria and other publications, says that the S.T.D. horror film continues to thrive as the acceptance of once-marginalized sexuality becomes mainstream.\u201cAs we get more comfortable with sex in general, it becomes the place to go to make you more terrified,\u201d he said.But \u201cLace Crater\u201d and \u201cIt Follows\u201d each have a twist: Both films end with their infected female leads living in diseased, but life-affirming, relationships. Mr. Atkins likens it to the moment in \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d where the lead character, played by Mia Farrow, looks into the cradle at her devil child and decides to love it.\u201cWhen faced with a new given, she has to make this decision about whether to sink or swim, about whether to give herself into this intimacy because she has nowhere else to turn,\u201d Mr. Atkins said. \u201cThat in itself, while being at a dead end, is a horror concept.\u201dSo is \u201cLace Crater\u201d something new, an S.T.D. horror movie with a happy ending?

{"Headline": "Suicide Bomber in Ansbach, Germany, Pledged Loyalty to ISIS, Officials Say", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byThe man, who entered Germany in 2014 but was denied asylum, detonated a backpack around 10 p.m. on Sunday, near the entrance to an open-air music festival that was attended by about 2,000 people. Of the wounded, four had grave injuries.In a span of six days in July, four high-profile attacks occurred in Germany, putting the nation on edge. Ten people were killed and more than 40 wounded in W\u00fcrzburg, Munich, Reutlingen and Ansbach.The attacks have profoundly disturbed a country that has taken pride in its ability to integrate migrants \u2014 enabled in part by its robust economy \u2014 and by its commitment to tolerance and openness.The video threatened \u201crevenge for the killing of Muslims,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said at a news conference in Nuremberg.While Germany has provided logistics, equipment and reconnaissance support to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, it is not involved in combat missions in Iraq or Syria, and unlike France and Belgium, it has not been seen in recent years as fertile ground for jihadist radicalization.The fact that three of the four attacks took place in Bavaria, the state at the front lines of the flow of migrants into Germany, resonated deeply.The bomber stayed in Bulgaria from late 2013 until the middle of 2014, Georgi Kostov, an official at the Bulgarian Interior Ministry, told journalists in Sofia.In December 2013, he was granted a status that allowed him to travel freely within the European Union, if he had the necessary documents.German officials offered a different account. Carda Seidel, the mayor of Ansbach, said the bomber had received two deportation orders, most recently on July 13, and Tobias Plate, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said the bomber had been notified of his impending deportation to Bulgaria. But he added, \u201cI can\u2019t at this point tell you why the deportation has not been carried out.\u201dRalf Millsaps, 59, who is originally from Mooresville, N.C., and has lived in Ansbach since April, after he retired from the Army, said he was sitting on the terrace outside the wine bar on Sunday night when the attacker sat down nearby.\u201cThe guy comes in, he\u2019s got long hair and earbuds,\u201d Mr. Millsaps said. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a giant rucksack, not a day pack, a rucksack that was thick. He sits down at a table and doesn\u2019t take off the rucksack.\u201d The backpack smelled of fertilizer or diesel, he said. The man left, but returned 15 to 20 minutes later \u2014 and then the backpack exploded.Mr. Millsaps \u2014 who said he had been treated for a shoulder injury and had given the clothes he was wearing to the police for testing \u2014 said he believed that the detonator went off, but not the full array of explosives in the backpack. \u201cThe size of his rucksack, it should have taken the side off the building,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here talking to you if the bomb had gone off.\u201d He added: \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about. This ain\u2019t my first rodeo.\u201dMr. Mahmood said he had spoken several times with Mr. Daleel and had never had any problems with him. \u201cI am shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I heard it was him, I was thinking: How could he do this?\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a street near the site of the attack in Ansbach. It is Pfarrstrasse, not Pfarrergasse.An earlier version of this article misidentified the type of knife used to kill a woman in Reutlingen, using information from the police.

{"Headline": "We Love \u2018Cats.\u2019 We Hate \u2018Cats.\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byIt would take you a long time to meet someone who dislikes cats as much as I do. Before you crumple this paper into a ball, or click away, I admit that my antipathy is irrational. I find cats standoffish and enigmatic, and don\u2019t get me started on the cat litter. Thus, when I saw \u201cCats\u201d the musical sometime in the 1980s, I went reluctantly.I enjoyed the show more than I expected, considering it was all cats and no plot. And as I left the theater, the songs stayed in my head so deeply that I didn\u2019t need to buy the record. Once those earworms disappeared, \u201cCats\u201d and I were done.Yet when I learned that \u201cCats\u201d was being revived on Broadway, one question quickly came to mind: Haven\u2019t we had a challenging enough summer?Who wants \u201cCats\u201d again? I posed the question to people of all stripes and have come to realize that the question is itself a theatrical acid test: It gives way to passionate replies on both sides. No one seems indifferent. (The first four performances this month grossed about $600,000, a promising start.)\u201cCats\u201d arrived from London a pop-music-inflected extravaganza, spectacular yet with the allure of sophistication, thanks to the poetry that inspired it. Families could go; tourists could go; non-English-speakers could get the point.Mr. Lloyd Webber said that the current version, which features the pop star Leona Lewis as the \u201cglamour cat\u201d Grizabella, will emphasize \u201cthe heart of the show.\u201d\u201cWhen it works really well,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s the T.S. Eliot that underpins us.\u201dAnd it\u2019s all cats, which in the years since the show closed have become only more ubiquitous. Think of the memes that now clog the internet \u2014 grumpy cats, sleeping kittens and more.Yet the people who feel that \u201cCats\u201d deserves to be forgotten are succinct in their opinions: Once is more than enough. Or, as Diane Sokolow, a television producer, told me: \u201cBack in the day, it was said that the worst thing about having a mistress is you had to see \u2018Cats\u2019 twice. Ba dum dum.\u201dAt the other end are enthusiastic fans, who are thrilled about the return of the thundering pitter-patter of feline feet.Tim Federle was an 8-year-old in Northern California when his parents took him to see \u201cCats\u201d at the Golden Gate Theater in 1988. \u201cIt happened when Victoria, the white cat, pawed my knee,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kiss Victoria; I wanted to be Victoria.\u201dHe continued: \u201c\u2018Cats\u2019 was my gateway to realizing that all my life as a child of doing flips in the living room and wanting to wear costumes and dance was for a purpose: I could be a professional dancer on Broadway. My dream role was Mungojerrie.\u201dAmong the \u201cCats\u201d lovers, I found that those who saw the show between the ages of 7 and 14 tended to become fanatical. Of course, one\u2019s first musical can have that effect on a person, wherever it happens. When I was about 5, I thought a musical version of \u201cThe Prince and the Pauper\u201d was magical, and it was performed without scenery in an unromantic basement.The television correspondent Mo Rocca is one of those who became (perhaps) scarily infatuated. He and his best friend Mario discovered \u201cCats\u201d when they were 13, in Bethesda, Md., comparing notes over the London and Broadway cast albums.At 14, he got the birthday present of his dreams: a family trip to New York to see the show.Their seats were lousy. And \u201cmy father got restless, and in the second act when Betty Buckley started singing, he started jangling his keys \u2014 that was when all dads had, like janitor keys,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear the first notes. It didn\u2019t matter.\u201dOnly the actor playing Gus, the theater cat, wrote back. But that was fine. Mr. Rocca carried that letter \u201ceverywhere, including to acting school camp. Everyone was inspired by it.\u201d He still has it, along with his \u201cCats\u201d sweatshirt from 1983.The fashion designer Rachel Antonoff attributes her interest in clothing to the costumes she saw in \u201cCats\u201d and other plays. \u201cI\u2019m going to the opening,\u201d she boasted, \u201cand I can legitimately say I have never been this excited before.\u201dWhile fans talk of how meaningful \u201cCats\u201d was for them, imagine how transformative it has been for cast members, including Ms. Buckley, who sang the 11 o\u2019clock number \u201cMemory\u201d in the original Broadway production and won a Tony for the role. \u201cMy job description,\u201d she said simply, \u201cwas to stop the show.\u201dFrom Los Angeles, where she is starring in \u201cGrey Gardens,\u201d Ms. Buckley noted that she got to see the show only in London, on its eighth anniversary. \u201cI realized that Grizabella was only onstage for 13 minutes!\u201d Laughingly, she added: \u201cThat\u2019s it! To me I was constantly onstage, lurking in the shadows, but it\u2019s 13 minutes for a role that was so important in my life.\u201dJoey Abramowicz has performed in \u201cCats\u201d more than a thousand times in nine different productions. The 37-year-old dancer and gymnast devoted most of 20 years to the musical, originally as the very athletic Tumblebrutus, but most recently as Macavity.What does he see as the enduring appeal? \u201cIt\u2019s the spectacle, and the sense of belonging to a tribe. No one knows if there\u2019s a story to follow. It\u2019s silly, but it\u2019s fun to look at.\u201dBut it\u2019s precisely that audience involvement that leaves some \u201cCats\u201d detractors most allergic.She was hardly alone. During David Letterman\u2019s late-night hosting run, he made fun of \u201cCats\u201d for months, featuring it on the Top 10 lists, mauling the song \u201cMemory,\u201d interviewing fake cat characters.If \u201cCats\u201d can stand for so many things, perhaps this is the exact right moment for its return to the big stage. Eliot\u2019s poems provided \u201cthe perfect outline for an entertainment,\u201d Mr. Lloyd Webber said.Personally, as long as no real felines are anywhere near the production, I\u2019m ready to give \u201cCats\u201d another chance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Sudan Slides Closer to War as Gunfire Rumbles in Its Capital", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byOn Monday, United Nations officials said that the large displaced persons camps in and around Juba that house thousands of people had been shelled, killing at least two civilians and wounding dozens. It was not clear if the mortar or artillery shells that had crashed into the camps were stray shots or were deliberately aimed at civilians seeking refuge. United Nations officials said they were deeply concerned and were trying to secure the camps as best as possible.Mr. Kiir\u2019s spokesman read a statement signed by the president calling for a unilateral cease-fire beginning at 6 p.m. local time, and he urged Mr. Machar to tell his fighters to stand down as well.\u201cThis is a unilateral cease-fire,\u201d said the spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny. \u201cThe president has declared, and is also urging the leader of the former rebel movement, Dr. Riek, who is still the first vice president of the republic of South Sudan, to also do the same and cease the hostilities.\u201dSecretary General Ban Ki-moon called on Monday for an \u201cimmediate arms embargo\u201d against South Sudan, saying that its rival leaders had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the peace deal they signed only months ago.The ball is now in the Security Council\u2019s court. The United States and China, the two countries with the greatest stakes in the country, have been lukewarm to the idea of an arms embargo in the past.He also called for the peacekeeping mission to be reinforced. There are 12,000 soldiers and police officers on the ground now. Mr. Ban said government troops had effectively been blocked from leaving their bases.Contingency plans are being explored to bring in more peacekeepers from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, United Nations officials said Monday.The displaced persons camps are considered to be in danger. Thousands of people, mostly members of Mr. Machar\u2019s ethnic group, the Nuer, are concentrated in rows of tents, easy targets for artillery. Many fled their homes in the past two years to escape ethnically targeted violence. Human rights groups say the violence between Nuer soldiers and those of the Dinka, Mr. Kiir\u2019s group, has spawned a range of atrocities, including mass rape and the widespread killing of civilians.One senior Western official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the South Sudanese government was accusing Mr. Machar\u2019s rebel forces of hiding in the displaced persons camps, which could be used as a pretext to storm them.The two peacekeepers who were killed in the latest round of violence were believed to be Chinese. One was killed while sitting in an armored personnel carrier that was trying to protect a displaced persons camp.South Sudan\u2019s recent history has been soaked in blood. Aid workers estimate that at least two million people have been killed in the past 30 years as South Sudan struggled against Sudan for independence and then factions in South Sudan turned on one another.In the beginning, Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar fought together in the war for independence, but later Mr. Machar broke off and joined the Arab-led Sudanese government against Mr. Kiir and his rebels, who are not Arab. Mr. Machar eventually returned to the rebel fold and was a crucial figure in the South Sudanese government when it achieved independence five years ago.Many analysts said the mistrust between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar might run too deep to overcome. Western and African nations have exerted enormous pressure on the two to work together, even with the threat of sanctions and international isolation.The fighting began on Thursday over something relatively small. A group of soldiers loyal to Mr. Kiir stopped a vehicle carrying a group of soldiers loyal to Mr. Machar, a senior United Nations official said. An argument erupted over whether the vehicle could pass through a checkpoint, and guns were drawn. Shooting started, leading to rolling battles across Juba that continued through Monday.By Monday evening, the shooting had subsided, but aid officials said the two sides were using the lull to reposition their forces.Jacey Fortin reported from Juba, South Sudan, and Jeffrey Gettleman from Nairobi, Kenya.

{"Headline": "Black Police Officers Feel the Inner Tug of a Dual Role", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byThe day after five Dallas police officers were killed in an ambush, Montrell Jackson, a black police officer in Baton Rouge, La., took to Facebook to voice his frustration.\u201cI\u2019m tired physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote, questioning the \u201cnasty hateful looks\u201d he received as a police officer and the way some people considered him to be a \u201cthreat\u201d when he was not in uniform. \u201cWhen people you know begin to question your integrity you realize that they don\u2019t really know you at all.\u201dBut he was hopeful: \u201cI\u2019m working these streets so any protesters, officers, friends, family, or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer. I got you.\u201dOfficer Jackson\u2019s haunting reflections before he died echo the particular strain of anguish facing black police officers around the country as the nation wrestles with the aftermath of killings involving the police.The deaths, the ensuing protests and the fatal attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge have intensified the internal tug of war that black police officers endure, the daily duality of being black and serving in blue.Detective Derick Waller, a 21-year veteran of the New York Police Department who is black, said he worried the tensions would edge officers even deeper into danger.\u201cNo officer leaves his house and says, \u2018Man, I want to kill somebody today,\u2019\u201d Detective Waller said.Still, Detective Waller, who had been planning to retire for a while and filed his paperwork on Monday, said he sympathized with African-Americans who say they are wrongfully singled out by the police.\u201cThere is something that\u2019s rooted in America in the police department,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just assumed that every black person that has a car with tint has a gun.\u201d Being stopped by a police officer fills him with fear, he said. \u201cWhen I get pulled over, I get scared. I turn my ignition off, and I put my hands out the window.\u201dThe movement\u2019s often boisterous denunciations of police violence have prompted a backlash from police unions, politicians and some rank-and-file officers, who accuse it of sowing hatred against men and women in uniform. Some have even blamed the movement for inspiring the gunmen in Dallas and Baton Rouge.Black police officers said that when the topic was race and policing, they often sidestepped talking in public, and even talking with their co-workers.In downtown Cleveland, where Republican convention-goers frequently cheered officers patrolling in groups on Monday, an eight-year veteran of the city\u2019s transit police said the strain around race and policing had become so great, he had taken to completely avoiding the subject at work.Standing near a group of activists protesting Donald J. Trump\u2019s nomination in a public square, he recounted a story about once being late to a shift and showing up in his civilian clothes, a white T-shirt and jeans. When he got to the office, a fellow officer approached him and said, half-jokingly, that he thought the officer might be a robbery suspect. \u201cAs a police officer, it\u2019s a culture that nobody wants to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to admit they might have singled someone out for how they look.\u201dAt home, some family members and friends avoid certain subjects around him, just as he avoids some subjects with his fellow officers.Talking to relatives can be agonizing.Lt. Zsakhiem James, who has been a police officer in Camden, N.J., for 23 years, drove to Dallas with four other officers to pay their respects, only to return to the news of the Baton Rouge ambush.He said his mother asked him on Monday, \u201cHow do you still do the job?\u201d She was referring to his safety, but the inquiry was freighted with deeper questions. \u201cHow do you put the uniform on and still go out after seeing all the things you\u2019ve seen as a black man and everything that\u2019s going on in the world and still do your job, and do your job right?\u201d Lieutenant James said.He was bracing for similar questions at a family reunion. \u201cI feel a sense of loss, but as a police officer, before I cast judgment, I wait for the full information to come out,\u201d Lieutenant James said. \u201cAnd they look at me and say, \u2018Aren\u2019t you outraged?\u2019 And I say I\u2019m outraged at the loss of a life; and what they don\u2019t understand is that the loss of any life at the hands of a police officer reflects on all police officers.\u201dJust as Twitter has helped nurture and sustain the protest movement, many officers have taken to Facebook to voice their own sentiments on the criticism shaking their profession, if only to their family and friends.In some cases, posts intended as private exchanges, like the one by Officer Jackson, have been thrust into the public sphere as sympathetic friends seek to show the world just how misunderstood black officers feel and just how frustrated they are \u2014 with other police officers, and with some people in the black community.\u201cIf you are white and you\u2019re working in a black community and you are racist, you need to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d she said in a video that has been viewed nearly eight million times.In Kalamazoo, Mich., a city of 76,000 people that is about 20 percent African-American, Lt. Anthony Morgan said he had faced hard questions from the black men in his family about policing issues, while also counseling the officers he supervises, most of them white. \u201cThe truth hurts, and you have to be honest with both sides,\u201d he said.In recent days, there has also been a positive response from the community, with strangers offering meals and kind words on the street, Lieutenant Morgan said.Kalvin Barrett, a police officer in Sun Prairie, Wis., a suburb of Madison that is about 6 percent black, said that residents there had largely been supportive but that he has had some difficult interactions over the years. In one case, as he was arresting a drunken driver who was African-American, the driver called him an Uncle Tom and told him he probably just wanted to harass people.\u201cI ran into that individual about three weeks later, and he apologized to me,\u201d Officer Barrett said. \u201cThat really showed me that people go through tough times in their life, and you can\u2019t hold them accountable\u201d for everything they say.But many black officers are pained by the thought that people who look like them are scared of them or even hate them because of the uniform they wear.A black officer in South Florida, who agreed to be interviewed only if he was identified by his nickname and middle name, Jay Stalien, said that when he came upon a motorist who had made an illegal turn recently and flipped on his lights, the driver initially refused to pull over. The motorist, a black woman, later explained that she was looking for a well-lit place to stop because she feared an encounter with the police.\u201cBefore it was just criminals that didn\u2019t like you,\u201d said Officer Stalien, who recently expressed his frustrations in a post on Facebook. \u201cNow everybody believes we\u2019re the bad guy. People who have never had a negative encounter with the police in their lives think they\u2019re in danger when we pull them over. It\u2019s disheartening.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about how recent police shootings have highlighted the inner tug of war that black officers experience regarding race relations and law enforcement paraphrased incorrectly from a Facebook post by Officer Montrell Jackson about the way he was seen when he was out of uniform. Officer Jackson, who was killed Sunday in Baton Rouge, wrote that he felt people considered him a threat, not that he felt threatened.Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Fandos, Joseph Goldstein, Rick Rojas, Michael Schwirtz, Mitch Smith and Timothy Williams.

{"Headline": "Europe Approves New Trans-Atlantic Data Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEuropean officials approved a new agreement on Tuesday that will allow some of the world\u2019s largest companies, including Google and General Electric, to move digital information freely between the European Union and the United States.Here\u2019s a primer on what was announced, what happens next and how it might affect you.What is the Privacy Shield and why does it matter? What are the main points? The pact bolsters privacy guarantees for anyone living in Europe \u2014 but not for people in the United States \u2014 when their data is shifted across the Atlantic. Many Europeans fear that their information might be used inappropriately by the United States government, including its intelligence agencies, and by companies.The new safeguards include a greater say for Europeans on how their information is used, the right to go to American courts when people think companies or the United States government may have misused their data, and written guarantees from American officials that government agencies will not indiscriminately collect and monitor Europeans\u2019 data without cause.A new position has been created in the State Department to handle European complaints that American intelligence agencies or other government departments may have unfairly collected and used people\u2019s digital data.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Why are Europeans so afraid of the United States government? Call it the Snowden factor. After the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed in 2013 that American intelligence agencies were actively spying on people worldwide, including in Europe, the region\u2019s population, policy makers and lawmakers were up in arms. Since the revelations, multiple legal cases have been filed across Europe, particularly involving United States tech companies caught up in the scandal, in an attempt to rein in these activities.Is everyone happy with the Privacy Shield? American and European officials say the pact goes further than the previous deal, ensuring that Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules are respected and replicated when data is moved to the United States.Where does that leave us? It remains unclear whether Europe\u2019s highest court could eventually overturn the pact, but legal experts say the case, if filed, would not be heard until late 2017 at the earliest. In the meantime, companies are spending tens of millions of dollars to ensure that their data protection rules meet Privacy Shield standards, and privacy groups are searching for test cases to use in their efforts to overturn the new agreement. (Filings are expected within months.)In the face of this uncertainty, the credibility of American and European officials is on the line. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and the United States Department of Commerce spent years negotiating the new deal. If it were eventually overturned in court, few companies or privacy experts would have faith that either side could do any better the next time around.\u201cThere always will be criticism because we don\u2019t have an equivalent legal system with the U.S.,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Justice commissioner who negotiated the Privacy Shield, said in an interview.\u201cI\u2019m looking at the practical positive impact that Privacy Shield will have,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not focused on what may happen with legal challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Struggle for Common Ground, Amid Fears of a National Fracture", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported by12 PhotosLong after her two sons were in bed, Shanel Berry kept vigil in front of the television at her home in Waterloo, Iowa, watching the week\u2019s horror unfurl and obsessing over a single question: Was the gunman who killed five Dallas police officers black?\u201cI just thought, \u2018Please, please don\u2019t let him be black,\u2019\u201d because if he was, she worried that police shootings of black men could become easy to justify. Ms. Berry, an elementary-school teacher, said she hurt for the officers and their families. But when the gunman was identified and his photo flashed on the screen, she sank even lower.\u201cI told my boys, \u2018Now, this will make it even harder.\u2019\u201dFifteen hundred miles away, David Moody, a retired Las Vegas police officer, woke on Friday morning to fellow officers writing messages of anger and condolence on their Facebook pages, posting black-clad badges in solidarity with the Dallas Police Department. He had seethed at what he called the anti-police sentiment of protests over the deaths of two black men fatally shot by the police in Louisiana and Minnesota. And now this.\u201cThe atmosphere that\u2019s out there right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get up in the morning thinking how can we violate somebody\u2019s rights today, how can we pick on this type of person. Every guy I know that\u2019s out there working is getting up every day and thinking he\u2019s going to make a difference.\u201dEven as political leaders, protesters and law enforcement officials struggled to find common ground and lit candles of shared grief, there was an inescapable fear that the United States was being pulled further apart in its anger and anguish over back-to-back fatal shootings by police officers followed by a sniper attack by a military veteran who said he wanted to kill white police officers.Just days after the United States celebrated its 240th birthday, people in interviews across the country said that the nation increasingly felt mired in bloodshed and blame, and that despite pleas for compassion and unity, it was fracturing along racial and ideological lines into angry camps of liberals against conservatives, Black Lives Matter against Blue Lives Matter, protesters against the police. Whose side were you on? Which victims did you mourn?In a televised interview, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations blamed President Obama for waging a \u201cwar on cops.\u201d On social media, others confronted the discrepancies in the everyday lives of black and white Americans, hoping understanding would lead to conversations and action.Along the Las Vegas Strip, a sunbaked cross-section of races, backgrounds and political views, tourists and workers said the relentless parade of violence during the week had left them mostly in shock and disbelief. They worried that more would follow.Police departments across the country took precautions, ordering officers to double up in their patrol cruisers and to work in pairs or teams. Civilians were also on guard. Trey Jemmott, an incoming freshman at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said his mother warned him to be careful before he left for the gym the other night.\u201cShe always told me, being an African-American, you already have strikes against you,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel like something\u2019s got to change. We thought we were over this.\u201dAt an outdoor food stand on the Strip, three co-workers \u2014 black, white and Asian \u2014 debated whether the bloodshed would lead to healing or deeper divisions as they talked about their own experiences with the police.Martin Clemons, 28, said he and other black friends had been frisked for jaywalking across the Strip. Zach Luciano, 23, who is white, said he had never been stopped or had a negative run-in with law enforcement, and had considered becoming a police officer.\u201cThere\u2019s more good cops than bad cops,\u201d Mr. Luciano said. \u201cI wanted to be one of those good ones.\u201dWhat the three co-workers shared was a grim view that the country\u2019s divides would not heal anytime soon.\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but this is what the world\u2019s coming to,\u201d Mr. Luciano said.\u201cI literally thought I would have a stroke. I could feel my blood pressure going up,\u201d said Ms. Bandele, 45, a Brooklyn native. \u201cI work day and night to end police brutality, and no matter how much responsibility I felt, I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201dMs. Bandele and her husband, Lumumba, helped found Copwatch after the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo in a hail of bullets fired by New York City police officers who mistook a wallet in his hand for a gun. She is frequently called upon to comment on police killings, and so watching these videos is part of her work.\u201cIt was just a breaking. I have spoken to people who are broken, and they just can\u2019t take any more,\u201d Ms. Bandele said. \u201cThose images visit me at night. The impact is emotional and it is physical.\u201dInstead, she rushed upstairs to try to take the phones of her two teenage daughters before they could watch the video. But her oldest, Naima, 17, met her on the stairs, distraught, her eyes filled with tears. Ms. Bandele had to take off from work Friday to comfort her girls, to help them deal with the pain they were feeling.Mr. Moody, the retired Las Vegas officer who also is the president of the Las Vegas Fraternal Order of Police, represents the reverse side that vigilance. He said he spent much of his career patrolling the city on motorcycle, and now, when he comes across a traffic stop or a police cruiser flashing its lights, he pauses to watch out for the officers.\u201cYou need citizens out there doing this kind of stuff,\u201d Mr. Moody said, \u201cbecause you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dMs. Berry, the teacher in Iowa, said she worked hard to raise her two boys, Dallas, 15, and Amari, 11, to make a good impression. Square your shoulders, she has always told them, look people in the eyes when they talk to you, and stand up for what is right. But that advice comes with a painful exception: Do none of these things if stopped by the police.\u201cThat is the hurting part,\u201d said Ms. Berry, 37. \u201cBecause that is the part that Dallas doesn\u2019t quite get. \u2018Why are you telling me to comply if I am not doing anything wrong?\u2019 I am trying to teach them to be men and stand up for themselves, but at the same time I am telling them to back down and not be who they are.\u201dThis past week has only made that tightrope walk all the more difficult, trying to balance protecting her children\u2019s innocence with preparing them for what feels like an eventuality. She sat down with her sons to watch the news coverage of the shootings and said she struggled with how to simultaneously caution her boys and comfort them.Dallas is about to turn 16, that age when the chests of teenage boys swell with bravado, when they obtain that quintessential American rite of passage \u2014 the driver\u2019s license.\u201cThis is something we should be celebrating,\u201d Ms. Berry said, \u201cbut I am terrified.\u201dDaniel Victor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chelsea Clinton May Be Willing to Lend a Hand if Her Mother Wins", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Bill Clinton does not know his way around a china pattern.He is unlikely, friends said, to dwell on the trimmings of the White House Christmas tree.And if he is still smooth at small talk when he must be, happy to riff on sports and science until the last guest has left, the staid ceremonial duties of a presidential spouse do not hold much appeal.With this in mind, old family hands have gravitated toward a typical Clintonian solution should the former president find himself as first gentleman in 2017: Perhaps the first daughter could help.Just as she assumed a lead role in her father\u2019s foundation and became a chief campaign surrogate for her mother, Chelsea Clinton is willing to step up should her parents need her if they return to the White House, according to the former first daughter\u2019s friends.How we provided real-time analysis of the final night of the Democratic National Convention, featuring Chelsea and Hillary Clinton.\u201cThat feeling of being valued and loved \u2014 that\u2019s what my mom wants for every child,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cIt is the calling of her life.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s historic nomination has already scrambled the established political family order, compelling Mr. Clinton on Tuesday night to deliver his own take on a traditional first-spouse speech: a former president producing a humanizing, if airbrushed, portrait of a partner and a parent.Clinton advisers say that Chelsea Clinton\u2019s influence and involvement in a prospective administration have not been given much thought. But they also say that Ms. Clinton is likely to lend a hand around major events and holidays, at least by phone and email, and to help her father with some of the traditional duties of a president\u2019s spouse.\u201cShe has a deep bond with them, and she knows that she can be a lot of help to them if they return to the White House,\u201d said Thomas F. McLarty III, known as Mack, a close friend of the Clintons and a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton. \u201cChelsea is so substantive, and has two young children, that I don\u2019t see her playing White House social secretary. But I do think she will chip in to help her father and mother with managing life in the White House.\u201dBetty Ford arguably had more long-term impact on American life, by easing stigmas on breast cancer and alcoholism, than her one-term husband did. Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan defined style for many women of their generations. Lady Bird Johnson remains deeply admired as a symbol of strength and loyalty to her husband. So does Eleanor Roosevelt, who became a political force in her own right.Hillary Clinton redefined the role of first lady by taking on a policy role on health care \u2014 failing on the goal of national health insurance but succeeding with congressional allies to enact the federal children\u2019s health insurance programs. And Michelle Obama has been a significant role model for women of color and a particular inspiration for young black girls in low-income communities.But any suggestion that Chelsea Clinton might be relied upon to perform traditional first-lady tasks has the potential to strike a nerve, prompting concerns about an overly gendered view of presidential family roles.And such a role might seem incongruent with Ms. Clinton\u2019s graduate degrees from Oxford and Columbia and her career in business consulting and nonprofit management. But friends of Ms. Clinton say she would never be offended if her parents asked her for help. Her mother, after all, was a Yale Law School star and accomplished lawyer when she threw herself into the role of first lady in the 1990s.Ms. Clinton is 36 \u2014 on the millennial borderline \u2014 seasoned enough to headline panels on global health and women\u2019s rights and young enough, particularly in her mother\u2019s orbit of high-profile supporters, to serve as an ambassador of sorts to 20-somethings skeptical of the Clinton name.Milestones in politics when women and minorities were first elected to federal, state and local government.\u201cI honestly think she\u2019s trying to get through the convention,\u201d said Elizabeth Weindruch, a childhood friend from Little Rock, Ark., stressing that Ms. Clinton had not determined what she hoped to focus on after the election.It was a heady week for Ms. Clinton, preparing to address the convention 24 years after joining her parents, as not quite yet a teenager, in New York for her father\u2019s nomination.In 1992, she grinned through orthodontic braces, played cards with friends and sustained a minor sightseeing injury. (She got leg cramps racing up the steps at the Statue of Liberty with Ms. Weindruch.)\u201cWe were just kids running around New York,\u201d Ms. Weindruch said Wednesday, en route to Philadelphia to be with Ms. Clinton once more.Ms. Clinton\u2019s schedule this week was at least as busy.On Wednesday, Ms. Clinton held forth on gay rights and voter outreach at a lunch for the Human Rights Campaign, earning two standing ovations and telling the crowd that she had been straining to suppress tears all week.An attendee, John Klenert, said he had watched Ms. Clinton grow up. He \u201cfelt sorry for her\u201d in her youth, he said, marveling at her evolution now.And he chafed, unprompted, at grumblings that Ms. Clinton should assist her mother in social affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult,\u201d he said. \u201cIf and when Hillary is in the White House, she can hire somebody.\u201dDonald J. Trump\u2019s campaign is likewise considering how it might put family members to best use if the Republican nominee is elected.23 PhotosThe Trump team has made clear that Ivanka, his oldest daughter, would take a leading role in an administration, along with her husband, Jared Kushner.At a panel event on Tuesday, Ms. Clinton took aim at Ms. Trump, with whom she had become friends in recent years, in response to a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.Ms. Clinton reminded the crowd that some of Ms. Trump\u2019s paeans to women\u2019s economic issues in her convention speech last week bore little resemblance to anything Mr. Trump had said on the campaign trail.\u201cThere are no policies on any of those fronts that you just mentioned on his website,\u201d she said, imagining a conversation with Ms. Trump. \u201cNot last week, not this week.\u201dA few minutes later, the youth-focused gathering \u2014 hosted by Glamour and Facebook, with an open bar \u2014 neared its end with an appearance from a pant-suited dance group, performing to a Beyonc\u00e9 song.Soon, the party was over. Ms. Clinton smiled politely and walked off the stage. She was expected a short while later in the convention hall, to cheer her parents on.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and the End of Truth", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byTolstoy wrote of \u201cepidemic suggestion\u201d to describe those moments when humanity seems to be gripped by a kind of mass hypnosis that no force can counter. The resulting movements, like the Crusades or the 17th-century Dutch tulip craze, cannot be controlled. We find ourselves in such a moment.To imagine that the words I write, or those of countless others lamenting the world\u2019s lurch toward the politics of violence, may stem this \u201cepidemic suggestion\u201d is to indulge in fantasy. It is part of the infernal nature of such eruptions that everything feeds them, including outrage. The slouching beast is insatiable.Warnings of danger are just the self-important whining of those in whose favor the decadent, soon-to-be-destroyed system has been rigged. The movement is the answer. Mendacity is the new truth. Choreography is stronger than content. The world is upside-down.Writing into such an environment is like directing a canoe into a gale. Still, here goes, while words still have some meaning.Goodbye to all that. This looks like the end of a brief interlude that began in 1945. The interlude was relatively peaceful by historical standards. It saw the construction of a rules-based world order undergirded by visceral knowledge of destruction and acute awareness of potential Armageddon. The postwar order involved new institutions, treaties, alliances, and even a union of the very European nations most given to repetitive bloodshed.Its end was signaled in 2014 by the Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, a move that ripped to shreds the \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d of Ukraine in direct violation of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.But it was not so much this act itself that presaged the unraveling. It was the lies that accompanied it. The Soviet Union, in 1931, used the slogan that two plus two equals five. Putin, a pure Soviet product, traffics in lies \u2014 the supposed Western encirclement of Russia, the preposterous notion that all the Russian forces and materiel in eastern Ukraine have been figments of the world\u2019s imagination.As George Orwell observed, \u201cFrom the totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than learned.\u201dEnter Putin\u2019s pal, Donald Trump, who declares that \u201cthere will be no lies\u201d as a prelude to shrieking unvarnished untruth for 76 minutes from a gold-limned podium. Where was Leni Riefenstahl when she was needed last week in Cleveland?Facts are now a quaint hangover from a time of rational discourse, little annoyances easily upended. Volume trumps reality, as Roger Ailes understood at Fox News, before a downfall that coincided with the apotheosis of his post-factual world.A red-faced bully, adept in the choreography of collective hysteria, arises. He promises that he alone can set things right. He is the voice. He stands against a great tide of menace, from ISIS to immigrants, and only he understands the vast dimensions of the danger.We have been here before. Fascism was a backlash against dysfunctional democracies. It invited belief in the leadership of the strongman against enemies within and without. Its currency was untruth and its culmination bloody unreason. It was decried and dismissed by those it would devour.It is inevitable, given what he represents, that Trump looks to Putin. Orwell again: \u201cTotalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth.\u201dPutin is not a totalitarian, but he has totalitarianism in him, and the conditions of today are not those of the 1930s. But in technology\u2019s disorienting cacophony, the disaggregation of increasingly unequal societies, the frustrations of the many millions for whom life has become an exercise in precariousness, the pressures of globalization and mass migration, the stirring of racism, the spread of terrorism, and the steady undermining of truth, the seeds of a new authoritarianism have been sown. This is the wave Trump rides.Trump\u2019s strongest argument is that he represents change and Hillary Clinton does not. He will see Clinton\u2019s charges of mendacity with accusations that she is untrustworthy. He may well win. Anyone denying this has not grasped that \u201cepidemic suggestion\u201d tends to be unstoppable.Brexit illustrated a thirst for disruption at any cost. It was the supporting act for a possible American leap in the dark that would place Trump\u2019s portrait in United States embassies around the world. Perhaps that\u2019s the least of it. Still. That face so displayed would signal the end of an era and imminent danger to the Republic and the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Dieters Flock to Instagram", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byOn Instagram, devotees of a diet called the Whole30 have shared more than a million colorful photos of gluten-free, sugar-free, alcohol-free and dairy-free meals, and the occasional image of people showing off their bodies after 30 days of diet restrictions.The comments are heavy on exclamation points!\u201cBack on the salad grind today for lunch!\u201d\u201cReally excited about dinner!!!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re crushing this!!\u201dFor 30 days last summer, facing a demanding work schedule and lacking energy, I joined the flock.At first, I lurked on the hashtag, wondering if I could really spend 30 days whittling down my options for brunch, happy hours and dinners out, the activities that punctuate a workweek and make many of us feel connected.(I did not post a before-and-after photo. I have my limits.)I was adding to Instagram\u2019s engine of visual inspiration. The site is used by dieters as a modern version of sticking photos on the fridge, a support program without the hassle, public exposure or cost of joining a group in person. The Whole30 is one of seemingly endless like-minded communities that, for the most part, emphasize healthy living over weight loss.Melissa Hartwig, who has worked as a sports nutritionist and fitness instructor, cocreated the Whole30 program in 2009. A book, \u201cThe Whole30,\u201d was published last year and has sold more than 500,000 copies.\u201cNot only do you want to feel like you belong to something bigger than yourself,\u201d Ms. Hartwig, 42, said, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to stay connected so you have the accountability and motivation.\u201dThe scientists studied the frequency of online exchanges without looking at actual messages, but the members who were the most active with other members lost more weight, they found.The study found that Calorie King users who connected with 10 or more friends lost on average 8 percent of their body weight over six months, compared with an average of 5 percent weight loss among those who made between two and nine friends, and 4 percent for those who essentially \u201cwatched\u201d but did not participate socially on the site.While the most-connected users in the Calorie King study lost the most weight, it\u2019s notable that the less active users also lost a significant amount of weight. And losing even just 5 percent of your body weight improves your health, research shows.Dr. Spring said the urge for privacy was found in a 2012 study by the Northwestern group, in which 96 people were given access to a chat application that encouraged a weight-loss competition. Researchers found that most of the people in the study did not want to share stories of weight loss. The few people who tried to do so were ignored or insulted by other group members.In a more recent test by the Northwestern researchers, 300 college students were asked to join a private Facebook group. That group is interacting with reading materials, but they\u2019re still afraid of being \u201cthat person\u201d who jumps in and shares their story, Dr. Spring said.Dr. Spring said that Instagram may have success as a dieting platform because it is actually \u201ca little bit less socially connected\u201d than other platforms, serving the online dieters who value privacy and want minimal interaction with others.\u201cSome people feel highly motivated and egged on to succeed when they can post their accomplishments on a leader board and compare their progress to others\u2019,\u201d Dr. Spring said. \u201cOthers cave under that kind of pressure and public scrutiny.\u201dI fell into the latter category. When I was plugged into the Whole30, I found that Instagram could be a cheap way to keep myself motivated without trumpeting my journey to the world.\u201cSocial media accounts have a tendency to promote everything as being perfect and rosy,\u201d she said, \u201cThat stress can and does offset the benefits from the healthier lifestyle they are trying to create.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Viking Ship Sailing the Great Lakes Is Getting Conquered by U.S. Regulations", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byWhen a Viking ship, meticulously recreated in Norway, crossed the Atlantic last month, the feat captivated history buffs in the United States. They could hardly wait to get a look at the vessel, which was scheduled to visit a series of ship festivals along the Great Lakes this summer.After making stops at Canadian ports, the Draken\u2019s crew was told by Coast Guard officials last week that if it wanted to sail through the Great Lakes, it had to hire a certified pilot, paid at an hourly rate that would amount to about $400,000 by the trip\u2019s end. If unable to pay, the vessel would be forced to turn back.\u201cThe crew has been devastated,\u201d Woody Wiest, a watch leader on the Draken, said at the time. Many of the team are volunteers, he added. \u201cThey changed their lives to be on the ship.\u201d\u201cThe struggle is not yet over,\u201d a statement from the ship said.Lorne Thomas, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said the agency was bound by a 1960 law requiring that all foreign vessels, except for recreational ones, have a pilot while on the Great Lakes. It couldn\u2019t grant a waiver even it wanted to, he said.\u201cUnfortunately the law is what it is,\u201d Mr. Thomas added. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there couldn\u2019t be a discussion about maybe it could be changed. But that needs to happen at the congressional level.\u201dRepresentatives of the Draken have portrayed their troubles as a result of an impenetrable maze of regulations on the Great Lakes, which straddle the border between the United States and Canada, while also sharply criticizing the cost that vessels of its kind \u2014 small and nonprofit \u2014 must bear to ply its waters.Representatives of the Draken \u201care just making a lot of things up,\u201d Mr. Lemire added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing and how to deliver the message. So it was quite a surprise.\u201dThe binational management of the lakes can be confusing for foreign visitors. Asked to explain whose rules apply where, John Swartout, the president of the Western Great Lakes Pilot Association, talked about shared boundaries, \u201cgray areas\u201d and rules that vary by district.Finally, he said: \u201cI wish I knew how to cut and dry it for you perfectly, but it is complicated.\u201cI fully appreciate how hard it can be to understand whether U.S. law or Canadian law applies,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd frankly I think the authorities struggle with that same issue because the law is not perfectly clear on that subject.\u201dThe Draken\u2019s ordeal has also drawn attention to questions about the costs of pilotage, an ancient profession that exists around the world to ensure safe steering in unfamiliar waters.Maritime officials, however, say the fees are commensurate with the skill and scarcity of qualified pilots. Mr. Lemire, the Canadian official, noted that the pilots were among the most highly trained mariners in the world. Until this year, the targeted annual pay for Great Lakes pilots was about $235,000, far below what they could earn elsewhere, Mr. Lemire said.\u201cIt was impossible to recruit people,\u201d he said.Still, officials acknowledge that the costs can be onerous for smaller, historical ships like the Draken that don\u2019t possess the resources of the big freighter companies plying the Great Lakes, where the maritime industry is estimated to pump more $30 billion yearly into the American and Canadian economies.And unlike in Canada, the American regulations offer no exemption based on tonnage or size, said Mr. Thomas, the Coast Guard spokesman.\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to everybody that reaches out to us,\u201d Ms. Blank said on Wednesday as the Draken was making its way toward Chicago. \u201cWe knew the people were interested and engaged in our project, but not to this extent.\u201dMs. Blank said the Draken was not against the pilots. But, she added, \u201cA project of our nature is not able to pay these sorts of costs. The fees are so huge. We really want to sail, and we really want to meet the people of the Great Lakes, and unfortunately we are not able to.\u201dIn April, just before leaving for North America, the crew held a ceremony during which a carving of a dragon\u2019s head meant protect the ship from dangers like sea monsters and unforeseen raids was mounted on the Draken. Luckily, the vessel encountered no sea monsters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Munich Killer Was Troubled, but Had No Terrorist Ties, Germany Says", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported bySomewhere along the way, Ali Sonboly got his hands on a 9-millimeter Glock handgun, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition for it. And at 5:52 p.m. on Friday, at a McDonald\u2019s in Munich a few miles from where he lived with his mother, father and brother, he started shooting.Mr. Sonboly, 18, moved on to a shopping mall across the street, then to the top level of an adjacent parking garage. By the time his rampage was done, he had killed eight other young people and one middle-aged person. Then, in front of two police officers, he killed himself with his own gun, the police said.In a span of six days in July, four high-profile attacks occurred in Germany, putting the nation on edge. Ten people were killed and more than 40 wounded in W\u00fcrzburg, Munich, Reutlingen and Ansbach.But unlike those two attacks, the one in Munich appeared, based on initial evidence, to have no overt links to the Islamic State or other terrorist groups, officials said Saturday. Nor did it seem to be directly linked to the wave of migration that has fueled racial, ethnic and religious tensions in Germany and across Europe.Instead, according to accounts by the police, prosecutors, and neighbors and schoolmates of Mr. Sonboly, this most recent assault appeared to be of a less ideological and more personal sort: a sudden, violent outlet for a quietly troubled young man.\u201cWe must assume that he was aware of this attack,\u201d Chief Andr\u00e4 said.But the initial picture of Mr. Sonboly that emerged in the hours after police officers found him dead, less than a mile from the shopping mall with a backpack full of ammunition and a single bullet wound to his head, was of a young man whose concerns were much closer to home.9 PhotosBorn and raised in Munich, he held both German and Iranian citizenship. His parents immigrated to Germany, and his father drives a cab. A student at a nearby public school, he was known to adult neighbors as a polite boy who delivered newspapers. He grew up in a secular household, neighbors said, and the family took pleasure in celebrations like birthdays and the Iranian New Year.Some news reports identified him as David Ali Sonboly, though he was known to everyone as Ali.\u201cHe was always friendly, very friendly,\u201d said Tovaiau Edo, 32, who lives in the family\u2019s apartment building. \u201cWhen I saw him and saw the story, it\u2019s like two different people. Not the same people. I cannot believe this.\u201dBut officials and neighbors said Saturday that Mr. Sonboly had been struggling on several levels. He had two previous encounters with the police, both times as a victim, once having been bullied by three other young people and once having been robbed. He spent considerable time playing violent online video games. He had been getting psychiatric treatment, possibly for depression, officials said.\u201cHe was always nice, kind, helpful,\u201d said a 14-year-old neighbor who attended the same school on Alfons Street as the attacker and asked to to be identified only by her first name, Safete.Safete said that she had seen the attacker at their apartment building around midday on Friday and that \u201che didn\u2019t greet me, like he normally does.\u201d\u201cHe was focused on the papers he was holding,\u201d she added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look up.\u201dSafete said the gunman had argued at one point with a schoolmate, \u201cand said that he was going to go on a shooting rampage.\u201d She added that she could not remember the name of the schoolmate, or the date of the altercation.Safete\u2019s 15-year-old cousin, who gave her name as Majlinda and attends the same school, said the gunman had been bullied at his current school and a former one.\u201cThis has nothing to do with Islam,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because he was bullied.\u201dA woman in a neighboring building, whose balcony faced the Sonboly family\u2019s balcony, said she and her 10-year-old son had become friendly with Ali. But the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Paulina, said she and her son had both noticed something off about him.Maps and timeline of the events according to the German police.\u201cAli was somehow closed up on the inside,\u201d Paulina said. \u201cHe had something. I don\u2019t know what it is, but something was wrong.\u201dThere were hints that his rampage had been premeditated. In a raid at 3:30 a.m. Saturday on his family\u2019s apartment in the Maxvorstadt neighborhood, which includes some of the city\u2019s renowned art museums and is adjacent to the city\u2019s historic center, the authorities found newspaper articles on police responses to other shooting rampages, as well as the book on school gunmen. The police also removed computer equipment, documents and other materials.Officials said they were investigating reports that the gunman might have hacked a girl\u2019s Facebook page and promised food at an especially low price to lure people to the McDonald\u2019s shortly before the first shootings. They were also investigating whether he had specifically targeted young people.Three of those killed were 14 years old, two were 15, and the others were 17, 19, 20 and 45. Three of the nine were female. All lived in the Munich area, officials said.Of the 27 people injured, 10 were in critical condition, including a 13-year-old boy.One of the bystanders fumed at \u201cTurks,\u201d and the gunman replied, \u201cI am German,\u201d \u201cI was born here,\u201d and \u201cI grew up here in a Hartz IV area,\u201d a reference to a tier of unemployment and welfare benefits \u2014 meaning that he was from a bottom rung of society.He seems to have eluded the police at that point, while the authorities were scrambling to respond to reports, later proved unfounded, of gunfire elsewhere and that there might have been as many as three attackers armed with long guns. At the height of the emergency, 2,300 officers were deployed throughout the city.When the police found Mr. Sonboly\u2019s body, they feared that the backpack he was carrying might contain a bomb. It did not, but it held 300 more rounds of ammunition.\u201cWe are assuming at the moment that we are talking about only one perpetrator, one perpetrator who committed suicide,\u201d said Thomas Steinkraus-Koch, the chief state\u2019s attorney in Munich.Among the many questions facing the authorities on Saturday as Munich slowly returned to normal was how Mr. Sonboly had gotten a handgun and so much ammunition, despite Germany\u2019s strict gun laws.There will also be questions about whether schools, social services and Mr. Sonboly\u2019s family failed to take sufficient notice of his problems, and about the degree to which other attacks and violence in popular culture might have influenced him.\u201cWe cannot ignore \u2014 and I don\u2019t know the solution, but without a doubt, and this was the case in this instance \u2014 that the glorifying of violence in internet games has a damaging effect on the development of young people,\u201d Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, the German interior minister, said on Saturday.Chancellor Angela Merkel, after meeting with top officials in Berlin, told the nation that the \u201cnight of horror\u201d was traumatic for a Europe already reeling from attacks this month in Nice and on a train headed to W\u00fcrzburg, Germany.\u201cWe are in deep and profound mourning for those who will never return to their families \u2014 the families, the siblings, the friends for whom everything will be void and empty today,\u201d she said.\u201cIt bears noting that the perpetrator had an academic book at his home,\u201d Mr. Hurrelmann said. \u201cHe appears to have recognized a familiar suffering among the 10 men in the book, who were in a similar situation.\u201dRukmini Callimachi reported from Munich, and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.

In recent days, however, the city\u2019s shores have been inundated by an overwhelming amount of debris, prompting public complaints and a search for the source of the refuse.Hong Kong\u2019s top official, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, said that mainland China was partly to blame. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an unusual phenomenon in recent weeks that lots of domestic garbage from the mainland has washed up in Hong Kong, which we estimate could be related to heavy rainfall and flooding,\u201d he said on Sunday as he and a dozen high-ranking officials picked up trash on Lantau Island.Mr. Leung said the Hong Kong government would coordinate with the authorities in neighboring Guangdong Province to reduce the flow of marine debris. Hong Kong is a semiautonomous Chinese city that sits at the mouth of the Pearl River, a major waterway that flows past several large Guangdong cities.\u201cThe trash we have on the beaches here is just horrendous,\u201d Mr. Stokes said in an interview. \u201cAt the moment, a large amount of it is mainland debris.\u201dBut he cautions that the dump site is unlikely to be the sole source of Hong Kong\u2019s marine trash problems, and the city, which produces a large amount of waste, is also responsible for the mess.

{"Headline": "Kid Models (and Their Moms) Trade Summer Fun for City Auditions", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byFive children, in brightly colored T-shirts and wrinkled jean shorts, chattered in an eighth-floor office in Manhattan on a recent June day, taking breaks to lick ice pops and play with Spider-Man dolls. It looked like an all-American play date, the type you may see depicted in a magazine.And that\u2019s exactly the point.It\u2019s summer in New York, and that means aspiring child models (along with, most often, their mothers, who aspire to be parents of child models) have traveled from all over the country to the city for a shot at stardom.Although both girls have budding Instagram accounts, summer in New York offers something even more alluring than online \u201clikes\u201d and hearts. \u201cI want to be in a real magazine that people actually read, like at the hair salon,\u201d Melia said.He spends a few months each year traveling to small-town conventions across the country, scouting young models who might want to travel to New York for the summer.\u201cSummer kids,\u201d as they are known in the industry, aim to secure auditions and jobs in the most competitive modeling market in the nation.The average child model working year-round could potentially make $20,000, according to Joey Hunter, the former co-president of Ford Models who founded the kids division there. But for these children, success may mean earning $13 an hour as a TV extra, if they\u2019re lucky.As is the norm with most agencies, FFT doesn\u2019t guarantee work to young models who make the pilgrimage, and the agency doesn\u2019t advance money. Agents are paid a percentage of what the models make.The kind of career-building effort that brings throngs of children and their parents to New York is not cheap, and returns aren\u2019t guaranteed. Melia\u2019s mother, Julie Baker, is divorced from Melia\u2019s dad and works as a manager at a shoe store in Cincinnati. She is on medical leave for knee surgery, and is taking her recovery time in the city.She estimates she has spent between $7,000 and $10,000 on modeling costs in the past year for Melia, who has made between $300 and $500 during that time. To pay for this trip to the East Coast, Ms. Baker created a GoFundMe page and hosted a going-away party, where friends and family gave money.Grace\u2019s mother, Valerie Nelson, who works in a cardiac catheterization lab in Cincinnati, estimates she has spent $13,000 to $15,000 since her daughter began modeling two years ago.How much has Grace made so far?\u201cZero dollars,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a hard number to figure out.\u201dBut she stands behind her investment in this career. \u201cPeople pay for private school, which is more expensive than that, and don\u2019t come out with life skills like that,\u201d she said.At the FFT offices, the children learn from Mr. Winfield. He has a way with kids, and a setup well suited for them: one bookshelf is covered in Spider-Man memorabilia, and on his desk sits a large plastic container covered in smiley-face stickers and filled with candy.Still, Mr. Winfield is running a business, and he speaks frankly to the children. \u201cYou know how your parents have told you, \u2018Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover?\u2019\u201d he said to the children, who fidgeted in chairs as they listened. \u201cWell in this industry, because this is film and TV and modeling, that\u2019s the first thing that people are going to do. They\u2019re going to judge a book by its cover. So your job is to make a good first impression.\u201dNew York has always been a summer destination for children who aspire to modeling careers. But the number of dreamers has been growing.With 33 families settling in the city this summer seeking child modeling opportunities with FFT, Mr. Winfield delivers the same speech during a number of sessions.A few weeks earlier, Catrina Black sat in a similar orientation meeting, taking in the same words. She had traveled from Birmingham, Ala., with her daughter Erin Black, who just turned 11. Erin has earned a first-degree black belt in taekwondo and has studied dance for seven years. She has hazel eyes and giggles often.Ms. Black is proud of the opportunity she\u2019s providing for her child. When she was 18, she said, she had the opportunity to go to New York to be a model. She was packing up, getting ready to leave Birmingham, but her father and stepmother talked her out of going.Ms. Black took a part-time job selling homeopathic diet supplements so she could afford to travel with her daughter.People have said to her, \u201cYou can\u2019t live your life through your daughter,\u201d Ms. Black said. But she\u2019s quick to rebut that view: \u201cI\u2019m not. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to be modeling, not me.\u201dSome \u201csummer kids\u201d carry not just the expectations of their parents with them to New York, but those of their communities back home.To afford taking two months off from her waitressing job in Buford, Ga., so she could escort her daughter Shyann Walker, 12, up north for the summer, Sharon Harris asked for help from relatives and friends. Shyann, who is entering eighth grade in the fall, keeps their supporters updated on their New York adventures through videos she posts to her Facebook page.By mid-July, Shyann still hadn\u2019t booked any jobs, but she remained upbeat. \u201cHave a dream,\u201d she said, recounting what she would advise other young hopefuls, \u201cthen go follow it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So Why Is It Still \u2018Full of Them\u2019?", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byA discussion group on Facebook called Texas Pew Pew Pew Show & Tell warned its users that it was intended to host conversations \u201cabout anything that goes pew pew pew,\u201d but not to facilitate the sale or trade of firearms.\u201cI just started to search for gun sales, and sure enough, Facebook was full of them,\u201d he said.Some users have tried to skirt the ban by advertising other products for sale, such as baby powder or a can of Hawaiian Punch, next to rifles.Mr. Monteiro said in the past month he reported about 500 posts or groups. Facebook took down about two-thirds of them, but sometimes only after follow-up complaints. Some of Mr. Monteiro\u2019s social media followers joined in the effort. \u201cIf even you report 10 and one gets knocked down, that\u2019s one less gun sale,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you want to do something practical, they don\u2019t have much to offer you there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an action I can take. Every time I foil a gun sale, I get a little satisfaction.\u201dGroups that operate in the open (ones with \u201cbuy guns\u201d in their names, for instance) have been taken down, and what remain are closed, coded or secret, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to shut down the marketplace,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Monteiro and Mr. Sibley described Facebook\u2019s reporting process as a cumbersome multistep procedure that can change from day to day.They suggested that Facebook has sophisticated software developers who could easily make the process of eliminating gun sales as automated and effective as it does in rooting out images of child pornography.\u201cWhen you want to change something, you can change it,\u201d Mr. Monteiro said. \u201cWhat all this boils down to is if Facebook did not want guns on the site, the guns would be gone tomorrow.

After returning home, she had to remember to bite off her fake nails and replace her sparkly iPhone covers with plain leather ones.But it was at one of those parties, when she was 15 or so, that Ms. Abu Hanna met a woman who told her that she used to be a man. Laughing, Ms. Abu Hanna asked her friends what \u201cthat lady\u201d was smoking. Her friends, laughing as well, explained gender reassignment surgery to her.The explanation came as a revelation to Ms. Abu Hanna, who had always assumed she would live her life as a very effeminate gay man. \u201cI said: OMG, really? Seriously?\u201d she said. \u201cThere are people who are like me? And then the idea came in my head, and I held on to it like a rope that would save me.\u201d\u201cShe was so beautiful, impressive,\u201d said Israela Lev, a transgender activist who organized the pageant and initially spotted Ms. Abu Hanna at a sushi restaurant in a mall.Now, Ms. Abu Hanna is looking ahead to a bigger stage: the global transgender pageant, Miss Trans Star International, in Barcelona, Spain, on Sept. 17.\u201cI think winning the crown in Barcelona will give some hope, like planting a seed of hope\u201d for other transgender people, she said. \u201cImagine because of who you are, you have to leave your family, home and country \u2014 I am speaking of Arab countries.\u201dShe plans to represent Israel out of \u201crespect, because it is a democracy that has given me peace between my soul and my body.\u201dShe will represent perhaps Israel\u2019s most cosmopolitan face, an Arab transgender woman who comfortably crosses between Palestinians and Israelis, among Muslims, Jews and Christians.\u201cI\u2019m Arab. I\u2019m Christian. I\u2019m Israeli. All that is tied together,\u201d Ms. Abu Hanna said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to win.\u201dShe has a good chance, said Thara Wells, the director of the pageant, because she has buzz as well as beauty. \u201cHer story is so different,\u201d Ms. Wells said.Simply getting to Barcelona became something of an ordeal for Ms. Abu Hanna, whose birth name is Hanna Abu Hanna \u2014 she adopted Talleen around the time of her transition. Fees and expenses add up fast, and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Tourism flatly rejected her funding request of $20,000. The Foreign Ministry was a bit more receptive, saying the request was under review. When asked about the delay, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Emmanuel Nahshon, responded \u2014 in verse \u2014 on WhatsApp:\u201cNerves are tense and egos are tenderwhen you apply for government moneywhether you\u2019re gay, straight or transgenderwaiting patiently is not always funny.\u201dDays later, the Foreign Ministry said it would pay for the entire trip.Lilach Ben David, 26, a transgender woman and activist, said she was \u201ctorn.\u201d\u201cTalleen Abu Hanna will most definitely be used by the Israeli propaganda machine in order to justify horrendous crimes against Talleen Abu Hanna\u2019s own people,\u201d Ms. Ben David said.But \u201cif Palestinian society was accepting of Talleen Abu Hanna as a trans woman,\u201d she said, \u201cthen she wouldn\u2019t have to go and work with the Israeli establishment.\u201dBeing openly gay and then transgender in that conservative Palestinian society was never going to be easy for Ms. Abu Hanna. Her father and much of her extended family cut off relations with her years ago, after she was outed by an angry boy scout in her troop who found out Ms. Abu Hanna kept a second Facebook profile as a woman.The scandal shook Ms. Abu Hanna\u2019s family. Fearing violence at the hands of a vindictive relative, her mother gave her $100 so she could flee, which she did \u2014 first to a Palestinian friend in Haifa, Israel, and then to Tel Aviv.\u201cUmmi\u201d \u2014 \u201cMom\u201d in Arabic \u2014 decorates one of her wrists, a tattoo of gratitude because, she said, her mother keeps in touch.She wavered on transitioning, she said, worried that she would lose her family for good. But one day, Ms. Abu Hanna said, she just felt as if she would explode. She traveled to Thailand in January 2015 to begin her transition. She wrote to her relatives, saying she wanted them to love the woman she was.In most other ways, life has been kind to Ms. Abu Hanna, whose transition has come at a time of greater cultural acceptance of transgender people. She faces no hostility in using women\u2019s bathrooms, she said, and most people use the right pronouns when referring to her. She receives a stipend from the Israeli government, which supports people who are transitioning.Her current boyfriend is a 24-year-old Arab university student. They are Facebook official, and she smiled as she scrolled through their seemingly endless selfies on her iPhone.Yet in a conflict-riddled society that often puts people in neat categories, some tensions are unavoidable, as was evident during a recent photo shoot in Tel Aviv.Ms. Lev, who is helping Ms. Abu Hanna prepare for the coming pageant, changed her into a black dress and draped a scarf over her head, making her appear as an exotically sexy clich\u00e9 of a Muslim woman. Ms. Abu Hanna flinched but acceded to a few shots.\u201cIt makes her look like an Arab,\u201d said somebody at the shoot. Ms. Abu Hanna ripped off the scarf. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved in politics!\u201d she shouted in Hebrew. \u201cI want peace!\u201dSomeday, Ms. Abu Hanna said, she hopes to counsel Arab parents to accept their transgender children. She then began a rehearsed speech on the subject \u2014 but when asked about her own father, she paused.Of course her father loved her, even if he cut off relations, she said.

The close-up views of violence, obviously traumatizing, are giving rise to a generation of young people who distrust authority, grow up well before their time and suffer nightmares that seem too real.While adults around them protest and demand criminal justice reform, young witnesses of the carnage are reeling from their losses and harboring pent-up depression that often comes pouring out in panic attacks and breakdowns, relatives say.\u201cThey are aware of what\u2019s going in the world, of how you can leave your house and you can very well end up in a body bag,\u201d said a sister of Ms. Bland\u2019s, Shante Needham, whose four children continue to struggle with the death of their aunt. \u201cThey watch the news. They see all the stuff going on on Facebook. And it\u2019s sad that kids even have to think like that, that if I get stopped by the police, I may not make it home.\u201dMs. Bland, 28, was arrested after being pulled over for failing to signal a lane change in Waller County, Tex., and was later found hanged in her cell. Her family has questioned the ruling of her death as a suicide and believes that the arresting officer made up an accusation after she refused to put out her cigarette.One of Ms. Needham\u2019s sons, now 17, tried to hold in his grief but ended up sobbing and punching a hole in a wall three days after his aunt\u2019s death. Ms. Needham\u2019s 18-year-old daughter usually cannot sleep more than five hours a night. And her 9-year-old son has taken to sleeping in her room at night out of fear of being alone.\u201cHe was sleeping in his own bed for a little while, and then one day he came up to me and said, \u2018Listen, Mom, I can\u2019t sleep,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Needham, of Naperville, Ill.

{"Headline": "Quiet Fixer in Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign: His Son-in-Law, Jared Kushner", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byInternational diplomacy is a world of careful rituals, hierarchy and credentials. But when the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, wanted to communicate with Donald J. Trump, he ended up on two occasions in the Manhattan office of a young man with no government experience, no political background and no official title in the Trump campaign: Jared Kushner.Mr. Kushner held court at length with Mr. Dermer, doing his best to engage in the same sort of high-level conversation that the ambassador conducted with career diplomats and policy experts from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.A 35-year-old real estate developer, investor and newspaper publisher, Mr. Kushner derives his authority in the campaign not from a traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but from a marital vow. He is Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.It is a new and unlikely role for Mr. Kushner, a conspicuously polite Harvard graduate whose prominent New Jersey family bankrolled Democrats for decades and whose father\u2019s reputation was destroyed, in a highly public and humiliating manner, by his involvement in electoral politics.Much about the Trump candidacy seems at odds with Mr. Kushner\u2019s personality and biography: An Orthodox Jew and grandson of Holocaust survivors, Mr. Kushner is now at the center of a campaign that has been embraced by white nationalists and anti-Semites.Mr. Kushner\u2019s role was described in more than two dozen interviews with friends, colleagues and campaign staff members, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could disclose interactions that were supposed to remain private. Mr. Kushner declined to be interviewed.\u201cJared is an amazing son-in-law, and we are very close,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement, describing him as \u201ca big and bold thinker.\u201d\u201cMy father looked at the deals Jared was doing and saw himself in those deals,\u201d Ms. Trump said.But the parallels end there. Mr. Trump came to Manhattan to outstrip his father\u2019s success; Mr. Kushner was seeking to redeem his family\u2019s tarnished name.The elder Mr. Kushner built the family\u2019s real estate business into a multibillion-dollar empire of apartments and land until he was sent to federal prison in 2005 for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations, many of them to Democratic candidates.The case involved a traumatic and tawdry family feud: At one point, Charles Kushner sought to retaliate against his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with the federal authorities, by hiring a woman to seduce him and videotape the encounter. \u201cVile and heinous\u201d was how Mr. Christie, then the United States attorney for New Jersey, described the conduct.Mr. Kushner does not like to talk about his father\u2019s travails, but they plainly left a mark on him. At his son\u2019s recent bris, he spoke of his wish for the newborn: \u201cMay life be hard enough that you grow, but not so hard that you break.\u201dMr. Kushner has described his time on the campaign trail with the wide-eyed wonder of a political neophyte. \u201cYou have to see this,\u201d he told his wife after returning from a Trump rally last year in Springfield, Ill.For months, he was more loyal son-in-law than campaign operative, his role mainly confined to standing alongside the candidate and making calls to potential advisers and donors.It was in March, after Mr. Trump inflamed Jewish leaders with an improvised vow to remain \u201cneutral\u201d in dealings with Israel and Palestinians, that Mr. Kushner emerged as an unchallenged force in the campaign.Mr. Kushner\u2019s first major foray into foreign policy did not go off without a hitch. At one point in the speech, Mr. Trump mocked President Obama, prompting Aipac to condemn those remarks. Mr. Kushner was furious at the group, but in the eyes of Mr. Trump, it had been a success.Mr. Kushner seems to relish the privileges that his status as Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law carries. In May, when Mr. Trump met with Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, Mr. Kushner tagged along.No detail seems too small. Mr. Kushner has become involved in curating videos on Mr. Trump\u2019s Facebook page, reviewing programming for the Republican convention and retooling the online store where Trump hats, T-shirts and mugs are sold.Donors, policy experts and Republican leaders regularly reach out to him as a gatekeeper to the candidate. And with increasing frequency, Mr. Trump turns to Mr. Kushner throughout the day for feedback.\u201cI\u2019ve been with Jared and the phone will ring, and it will be Trump soliciting Jared\u2019s opinion,\u201d Mr. Kurson said.Mr. Kushner does not always wait for Mr. Trump to call. He pushed behind the scenes, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s three oldest children, for the dismissal of Mr. Lewandowski, a polarizing figure who had overseen Mr. Trump\u2019s primary campaign and begun to see Mr. Kushner as an internal rival.Unlike his father-in-law, with his seemingly bottomless appetite for conflict, Mr. Kushner is, by all accounts, soft-spoken and restrained. In the midst of a difficult real estate negotiation a few years ago, the Swatch-wearing Mr. Kushner playfully proposed an unconventional solution to a standoff: an arm-wrestling match.\u201cIt was such a simple way to resolve a conflict when the conflict didn\u2019t need to be there in the first place,\u201d said his counterpart in the negotiation, Adam Neumann, a founder of WeWork, which provides shared work spaces to entrepreneurs.Mr. Kushner lost.He is, Mr. Neumann said, \u201cthe opposite of a traditional New York developer.\u201dBut not entirely. Mr. Kushner, whose dimpled cheeks and baby face are a fixture of society pages, has embraced the trappings of a mogul. He moved with his wife into a penthouse of a Trump-branded tower on Park Avenue and courted the friendship of Rupert Murdoch, the founder of Fox News, whose young daughters were flower girls at Mr. Kushner\u2019s wedding to Ms. Trump.But for Mr. Kushner, an awkward reality remains: Many of his friends and co-workers are socially liberal Democrats who are horrified by the Trump campaign. The topic is more or less off limits at Mr. Kushner\u2019s company, people who have spent time there said, and old friends said they avoided it in Mr. Kushner\u2019s presence.\u201cThere is no purpose in discussing it,\u201d said Joel I. Klein, the former New York City Schools chancellor who socializes with Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump. As a Hillary Clinton supporter, Mr. Klein said, \u201cWe leave this piece alone.\u201dThe skepticism and disapproval from his peers appear to have hardened Mr. Kushner\u2019s resolve. Friends who have spoken with him said he felt vindicated by Mr. Trump\u2019s improbable electoral success, playing down doubts about his strategy and expressing admiration for his political acumen.Now, between flights with Mr. Trump and the flurry of campaign calls and meetings, Mr. Kushner is devoting far less time to his real estate empire.His father-in-law, whose own eyes have been known to drift away from real estate, seems to approve.\u201cDespite his great business success,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement, \u201che has the right priorities \u2014 family first.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Deputy Mike A. Barraza said by phone on Monday that the department was awaiting the results of an autopsy.The authorities in Monterey County \u2014 with a population over 415,000 \u2014 expanded their evacuation orders as the fire continued to spread from the Palo Colorado Canyon and Garrapata State Park regions. Up to 1,650 structures were in danger, officials said.Teams of firefighters \u2014 about 3,000 total \u2014 have been battling both blazes since Friday. In the Angeles National Forest area, firefighters were also contending with rising temperatures and high winds. High temperatures up to 98 degrees, with 60 percent humidity, were expected on Monday, with winds up to 25 miles per hour.Experts say that wildfires in the United States are now more destructive and dangerous than ever.The hazards were amplified as firefighters battled the blaze on extremely steep, forested terrain, and power lines had fallen onto some roads, said Karina Gutierrez, a spokeswoman with the National Forest Service.The Los Angeles Fire Department deputy chief, John Tripp, said on Monday that hundreds of fire engines had been brought in to combat the fast-moving flames.\u201cThe fire wants to get up; it wants to run,\u201d he said at a televised news conference.At least four evacuation centers were opened \u2014 including in a fairground, a college and a high school \u2014 and many residents were arriving with large animals, Deputy Barraza said.\u201cA lot of people have horses up there,\u201d he added, referring to the Santa Clarita and Acton areas.Residents evacuated in Acton on Sunday afternoon had hoped to return soon, but those plans were shelved.\u201cThey were going to let residents return to their households, but shifting winds made the fire spread,\u201d Deputy Barraza said, referring to the Santa Clarita area called the Sand Canyon, which gave the wildfire its name.Wayne Wilson, a pastor who has lived in Acton for 22 years, said the fire had scorched the hills along the eastern fringe of the small town, where it is not unusual to see people riding horses in the street.Reached by phone Monday, he said that over the weekend, the streets of the small town were pungent with the smell of smoke, which blanketed the sky so heavily that the sun was barely visible. As flames shot up on the ridges, residents began evacuating, with some trying to coax into trailers horses spooked by the fires.\u201cIt has been dark the last couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are breathing ash.\u201d\u201cIt is like you are sitting around a campfire and there is smoke in your face,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is constant.\u201dPastor Wilson said he and others in Acton had been reaching out to help their neighbors, mostly on the east side of town, which is closest to the fireline. He said he had invited residents of nearby Soledad Canyon to live on his property in recreational vehicles.He said residents were also pooling resources via social media and Facebook to find and offer help.\u201cThere is a lot of community spirit,\u201d he said.On Monday, the smoke was not as thick as it had been in previous days, leading some to hope that the winds were changing, he said.Experts say wildfires in the United States are becoming more destructive, with the increase in recent years attributed to a warming climate, suppression tactics and the building of homes in fire-prone areas.In Monterey County on Monday, firefighters had to deal with steep terrain that was heavily forested with Monterey pines and redwoods, and blanketed with grass and brush.Jonathan Pangburn, a State Cal Fire spokesman with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, watched as crews and bulldozers started building containment lines around him at the northern end of the fire near the Carmel highlands.\u201cThere has been a pretty intense drought for years,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cThis last winter and spring we had pretty close to average rainfalls, but it was nowhere near enough to counter the intense drought.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysia Links Nightclub Attack to Islamic State", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 A grenade attack at a nightclub in Malaysia last week was the work of the Islamic State, and two men who received instructions from a fighter for the group have been arrested, the Malaysian authorities said on Monday.The attack early last Tuesday in the town of Puchong, near the capital, Kuala Lumpur, injured eight people and was thought to have been the first assault in Malaysia tied to the Islamic State.Khalid Abu Bakar, Malaysia\u2019s inspector general of police, said at a news conference that the two suspects had been ordered to carry out attacks by a known Islamic State fighter from Malaysia, whom he identified as Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi.More than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.\u201cThe two of those arrested had received instructions from Muhammad Wanndy, who had commanded them to carry out attacks in Malaysia on our government leaders, top police officials and judges,\u201d Mr. Khalid said.The police have arrested 15 people, including two police officers, in connection with the assault on the Movida nightclub, Reuters reported. Two more suspects were being sought.The police initially said they believed that the attack was gang related or had been prompted by a business dispute. But after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for it on Facebook, the police refocused their investigation.Malaysia is a predominantly Muslim country, and the authorities have been active in rounding up people suspected of Islamic extremism.Mr. Khalid said all of the suspects who had been detained since the nightclub attack had been told to target top officials and entertainment centers.The authorities are also investigating reports on social media that at least one of the six men who attacked a cafe in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Friday had attended Monash University in Malaysia, an affiliate of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Twenty hostages and two police officers were killed in that attack.The university released a statement saying that it had not received confirmation of the attackers\u2019 identities but that it had met with the authorities to discuss the reports.Greg Barton, a research professor in global Islamic politics at the Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalization in Australia, said extremists had avoided attacking Malaysia in the past, in part because it provided an easy, visa-free transit point useful for planning.But that could be changing, as the Islamic State mounts attacks all over the world.Professor Barton pointed out that a large number of radicals had gravitated to the Klang Valley region of Malaysia, where they blend in with nonviolent extremists, making it difficult for the police to break up plots.\u201cThe Malaysians deserve some credit for intelligence and disruption achievements against local I.S. networks, but they are yet to be seriously tested,\u201d he said, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cAnd all the indications are that testing times are coming in the second half of this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then the Death Threats Began.", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byJIDDA, Saudi Arabia \u2014 For most of his adult life, Ahmed Qassim al-Ghamdi worked among the bearded enforcers of Saudi Arabia. He was a dedicated employee of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice \u2014 known abroad as the religious police \u2014 serving with the front-line troops protecting the Islamic kingdom from Westernization, secularism and anything but the most conservative Islamic practices.Some of that resembled ordinary police work: busting drug dealers and bootleggers in a country that bans alcohol. But the men of \u201cthe Commission,\u201d as Saudis call it, spent most of their time maintaining the puritanical public norms that set Saudi Arabia apart not only from the West, but from most of the Muslim world.A key offense was ikhtilat, or unauthorized mixing between men and women. The kingdom\u2019s clerics warn that it could lead to fornication, adultery, broken homes, children born of unmarried couples and full-blown societal collapse.For years, Mr. Ghamdi stuck with the program and was eventually put in charge of the Commission for the region of Mecca, Islam\u2019s holiest city. Then he had a reckoning and began to question the rules. So he turned to the Quran and the stories of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, considered the exemplars of Islamic conduct. What he found was striking and life altering: There had been plenty of mixing among the first generation of Muslims, and no one had seemed to mind.So he spoke out. In articles and television appearances, he argued that much of what Saudis practiced as religion was in fact Arabian cultural practices that had been mixed up with their faith.There was no need to close shops for prayer, he said, nor to bar women from driving, as Saudi Arabia does. At the time of the Prophet, women rode around on camels, which he said was far more provocative than veiled women piloting S.U.V.s.He even said that while women should conceal their bodies, they needed to cover their faces only if they chose to do so. And to demonstrate the depth of his own conviction, Mr. Ghamdi went on television with his wife, Jawahir, who smiled to the camera, her face bare and adorned with a dusting of makeup.It was like a bomb inside the kingdom\u2019s religious establishment, threatening the social order that granted prominence to the sheikhs and made them the arbiters of right and wrong in all aspects of life. He threatened their control.Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s colleagues at work refused to speak to him. Angry calls poured into his cellphone and anonymous death threats hit him on Twitter. Prominent sheikhs took to the airwaves to denounce him as an ignorant upstart who should be punished, tried \u2014 and even tortured.I had come to Saudi Arabia to explore Wahhabism, the hyper-conservative Saudi strain of Sunni Islam that is often blamed for fueling intolerance around the world \u2014 and nurturing terrorism. I spent weeks in Riyadh, Jidda and other cities speaking with sheikhs, imams, religious professors and many others as I tried to peel back the layers of a closed and private society.For the Western visitor, Saudi Arabia is a baffling mix of modern urbanism, desert culture and the never-ending effort to adhere to a rigid interpretation of scriptures that are more than 1,000 years old. It is a kingdom flooded with oil wealth, skyscrapers, S.U.V.s and shopping malls, where questions about how to invest money, interact with non-Muslims or even treat cats are answered with quotes from the Quran or stories about the Prophet Muhammad.Religion is woven into daily life. Banks employ clerics to ensure they follow Shariah law. Mannequins lack heads because of religious sensitivities to showing the human form. And schoolbooks detail how boys should cut their hair, how girls should cover their bodies and how often a person should trim his or her pubic hair.While Islam is meant to be a complete program for human life, interpretation is key when it comes to practices. The Saudi interpretation is steeped in the conservatism of central Arabia, especially regarding relations between women and men.In public, most women wear baggy black gowns called abayas, designed to hide their forms, as well as veils that cover their hair and faces, with only thin slits for their eyes. Restaurants have separate sections for \u201cfamilies,\u201d meaning groups that include women, and for \u201csingles,\u201d which means men.Many Saudis mix in private, and men and women can usually meet in hotel lobbies with little problem. Others do not want to mix and see gender segregation as part of their cultural identity. In some conservative circles, men go their whole lives without seeing the faces of women other than their immediate family \u2014 even their brothers\u2019 wives.Officials I spoke with were upset by the kingdom\u2019s increasingly troubled reputation abroad and said over and over that they supported \u201cmoderate Islam.\u201dBut what exactly did they mean by \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d? Unpacking that term made it clear how wide the values gap is between Saudi Arabia and its American ally. The kingdom\u2019s \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d publicly beheads criminals, punishes apostates and prevents women from traveling abroad without the permission of a male \u201cguardian.\u201dDon\u2019t even ask about gay rights.Instead of calls for jihad, what I heard were religious leaders insisting that the faithful obey the state. The Saudi royal family is terrified that the jihadist fervor inflaming the region will catch fire at home and threaten its control. So it has marshaled the state\u2019s religious apparatus to condemn the jihadists and proclaim the religious duty of obedience to the rulers.And while it was once common, I heard little disparaging talk about Christians and Jews, although it was open season on Shiites, whose faith is frequently bashed as part of the rivalry with Iran.The only Saudis who suggested I was an infidel were children.Once, a Saudi journalist proudly introduced me to his 9-year-old daughter, whom he had put in private school so she could study English.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d I asked.\u201cMy name is Dana,\u201d she said.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cI am 9.\u201d\u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201dConfused, she switched to Arabic.\u201cWe don\u2019t have that in Saudi Arabia,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an infidel holiday.\u201dShocked, her father asked where she had learned that, and she fetched one of her government-issued textbooks, flipping to a lesson that listed \u201cforbidden holidays\u201d: Christmas and Thanksgiving. Birthdays had been part of the same lesson.Another time, I met a religious friend for coffee, and he brought his two young sons. When the call to prayer sounded, my friend went to pray. His sons, confused that I did not follow, looked at me wide-eyed and asked, \u201cAre you an infidel?\u201dThe first thing many Saudis will tell you about Wahhabism is that it does not exist.\u201cThere is no such thing as Wahhabism,\u201d Hisham al-Sheikh told me the first time we met. \u201cThere is only true Islam.\u201dThe irony is that fewer people have a purer Wahhabi pedigree than Mr. Sheikh, a direct descendant of the cleric who started it all.In the early 18th century, Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abdul-Wahhab called for a religious reformation in central Arabia. Feeling that Islam had been corrupted by practices like the veneration of saints and tombs, he called for the stripping away of \u201cinnovations\u201d and the return to what he considered the pure religion.He formed an alliance with a chieftain named Mohammed ibn Saud that has underpinned the area\u2019s history ever since. Then the Saud family assumed political leadership while Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab and his descendants gave legitimacy to their rule and managed religious affairs.That mix proved potent among the warring Arabian tribes, as Wahhabi clerics provided justification for military conquest in some cases: Those who resisted the House of Saud were not just enemies, but infidels who deserved the sword.The first Saudi state was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1818, and attempts to build another failed until the early 20th century, when King Abdulaziz al-Saud undertook a campaign that put him in control of most of the Arabian Peninsula.But the king faced a choice: to continue expansionary jihad, which would have invited conflict with the British, or to build a modern state. He chose the latter, even crushing a group of his own warriors who refused to stop fighting.Since then, the alliance between the royal family and the clerics has endured, although the tensions between the quest for ideological purity and the exigencies of modern statehood remain throughout Saudi society.Fast forward to 2016, and the main players have transformed because of time and oil wealth. The royal family has grown from a group of scrappy desert dwellers into a sprawling clan awash in palaces and private jets. The Wahhabi establishment has evolved from a puritan reform movement into a bloated state bureaucracy.It consists of universities that churn out graduates trained in religious disciplines; a legal system in which judges apply Shariah law; a council of top clerics who advise the king; a network of offices that dispense fatwas, or religious opinions; a force of religious police who monitor public behavior; and tens of thousands of mosque imams who can be tapped to deliver the government\u2019s message from the pulpit.The call to prayer sounds five times a day from mosques and inside of malls so clearly that many Saudis use it to organize their days.\u201cLet\u2019s meet after the sunset prayer,\u201d they would tell me, sometimes unsure what time that was. So I installed an app on my phone that let me look up prayer times and buzzed when the call sounded.And so it was, after the sunset prayer, that I met Mr. Sheikh, a proud sixth-generation descendant of Mohammed ibn Abdul-Wahhab.He was a portly man of 42 who wore a long white robe and covered his head with a schmag, or checkered cloth. His beard was long and he had no mustache, in imitation of the Prophet Muhammad, and he squinted through reading glasses perched on his nose while peering at his iPhone.We sat on purple couches in the music-free lobby of a Riyadh hotel and shared dates and coffee while he answered my questions about Islam in Saudi Arabia.\u201cI am an open-minded person,\u201d he told me early on.It was clear that he hoped I would become a Muslim.His life had been defined by the religious establishment, but he proved to be a case study in the complexity of terms like \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d in Saudi Arabia. He had memorized the Quran at a young age and studied with prominent clerics before completing his doctorate in Shariah, with his thesis on how technology changed the application of Shariah.Now he had a successful career and a host of religious jobs. He trained judges for the Shariah courts, advised the minister of Islamic affairs, wrote studies for the clerics who advise the king and served on the Shariah board of the Medgulf insurance company. On Fridays, he preached at a mosque near his mother\u2019s house and welcomed visitors who came to see his uncle, the grand mufti.He had traveled extensively abroad, and when he found out I was American he told me that he loved the United States. He had visited Oregon, New York, Massachusetts and Los Angeles. On one trip, he visited a synagogue. On another, a black church. He had also visited an Amish community, which he found fascinating.A relative of his lived in Montgomery, Ala., and he had spent happy months there, often visiting the local Islamic center. The hardest part, he said, was Ramadan, because there were few eateries open late that did not have bars.\u201cAll I had was IHOP,\u201d he said.He said Islam did not forbid doing business or having friendships with Christians or Jews. He opposed Shiite beliefs and practices, but said it was wrong to do as the extremists of the Islamic State and declare takfir, or infidelity, on entire groups.When it came to birthdays, which many Saudi clerics condemn, he said he did not oppose them, although his wife did, so their children did not go to birthday parties. But they had celebrations of their own, he said, showing me a video on his phone of his family gathered around a cake bearing the face of his son Abdullah, 15, who had just memorized the Quran. They lit sparklers and cheered, but did not sing.He was on the fence about music, which many Wahhabis also forbid. He said he had no problem with background music in restaurants, but opposed music that put listeners in a state similar to drunkenness, causing them to jump around and bang their heads.\u201cWe have something better,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can listen to the Quran.\u201dSince much of what differentiates Saudi Arabia is the place of women, I wanted to talk to a conservative Saudi woman, which was tricky because most would refuse to meet with any unrelated male \u2014 let alone a non-Muslim correspondent from the United States. So I had a female Saudi colleague, Sheikha al-Dosary, contact Mr. Sheikh\u2019s wife, Meshael, who said she would meet me.But I asked Mr. Sheikh\u2019s permission.\u201cShe is very busy,\u201d he said, and changed the subject.So Ms. Sheikh met Ms. Dosary at a women\u2019s coffee shop in Riyadh, where women can uncover their faces and hair.Her marriage to Mr. Sheikh had been arranged, she said. They met once for less than an hour before they were married, and he had seen her face.\u201cIt was hard for me to look at him or to check him out as I was so shy,\u201d she said.They were cousins. He was 21; she was 16. He agreed to her condition for marriage that she continue her studies, and she was now working on a doctorate in education while raising their four children.She disputed the Western idea that Saudi women lack rights.\u201cThey believe we are oppressed because we don\u2019t drive, but that is incorrect,\u201d Ms. Sheikh said, adding that driving would be a hassle in Riyadh\u2019s snarled traffic.\u201cHere women are respected and honored in many ways you don\u2019t find in the West,\u201d she continued.She, too, is a descendant of Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab and said proudly that her grandfather had founded the kingdom\u2019s religious police. \u201cPraise God that we have the Commission to protect our country,\u201d she said.Their embrace of technology runs counter to the history of Wahhabi clerics rejecting nearly everything new as a threat to the religion. Formerly banned items include the telegraph, the radio, the camera, soccer, girls\u2019 education and televisions, whose introduction in the 1960s caused outrage.For Saudis, trying to navigate what is permitted, halal, and what is not, haram, can be challenging. So they turn to clerics for fatwas, or nonbinding religious rulings. While some may get a lot of attention \u2014 as when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran called for killing the author Salman Rushdie \u2014 most concern the details of religious practice. Others can reveal the sometimes comical contortions that clerics go through to reconcile modernity with their understanding of religion.\u201cPhotography is not permitted unless necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cNot with cats, not with dogs, not with wolves, not with anything.\u201dIt goes on: \u201cSlavery in Islam is like a purifying machine or sauna in which those who are captured enter to wash off their dirt and then they come out clean, pure and safe, from another door.\u201dOnce while we were having coffee, Mr. Sheikh answered his cellphone, listened seriously and issued a fatwa on the spot. He got such calls frequently.The query had been about where a pilgrim headed to Mecca had to don the white cloths of ritual purity \u2014 an easy one. The answer, in this case, was Jidda. Others were harder, and he demurred if he was not sure. Once, a woman asked about fake eyelashes. He told her that he did not know, but thought about it later and decided they were fine, on one condition: \u201cthat there is no cheating involved.\u201dA woman, for example, could put them on before a man came to propose.\u201cAnd then after they get married, they\u2019re gone!\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not permitted.\u201dOne Friday, Mr. Sheikh took me to see his uncle, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz al-Sheikh.We entered a vast reception hall near the mufti\u2019s house in Riyadh, with padded benches along the walls where a dozen bearded students sat. In the center, on a raised armchair, sat the mufti, his feet in brown socks and perched on a pillow. The students read religious texts, and the mufti interjected with commentary. He was 75, Mr. Sheikh said, and had been blind since age 14, when a German doctor carried out a failed operation on his eyes.Mr. Sheikh said I could ask him a question, so I asked how he responded to those who compared Wahhabism to the Islamic State.\u201cThat is all lies and slander. Daesh is an aggressive, tyrannous group that has no relation,\u201d he said, using another term for the Islamic State.After a pause, he asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a Muslim?\u201dI responded that I was from a Christian family.\u201cThe religion you follow has no source,\u201d he said, adding that I should accept the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s revelation.\u201cYour religion is not a religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, you will have to face God.\u201dThe first time I met Mr. Ghamdi, 51, formerly of the religious police, was this year in a sitting room in his apartment in Jidda, the port city on the Red Sea. The room had been outfitted to look like a Bedouin tent. Burgundy fabric adorned the walls, gold tassels hung from the ceiling, and carpets covered the floor, to which Mr. Ghamdi pressed his forehead in prayer during breaks in our conversation.He spoke of how the world of sheikhs, fatwas and the meticulous application of religion to everything had defined his life.But that world \u2014 his world \u2014 had frozen him out.Little in his background suggested that he would become a religious reformer. While at a university, he quit a job at the customs office in the Jidda port because a sheikh told him that collecting duties was haram.After graduation, he studied religion in his spare time and handled international accounts for a government office \u2014 a job requiring travel to non-Muslim countries.\u201cThe clerics at that time were releasing fatwas that it was not right to travel to the countries of the infidels unless it was necessary,\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said.So he quit.Then he taught economics at a technical school in Saudi Arabia, but didn\u2019t like that it taught only capitalism and socialism. So he said he had added material on Islamic finance, but the students complained about the extra work, and he left.He finally landed a job that he felt was consistent with his religious convictions, as a member of the Commission in Jidda.Over the next few years, he transferred to Mecca and cycled through different positions. There were occasional prostitution cases, and the force sometimes caught sorcerers \u2014 who can be beheaded if convicted in court.But he developed reservations about how the force worked. His colleagues\u2019 religious zeal sometimes led them to overreact, breaking into people\u2019s homes or humiliating detainees.\u201cLet\u2019s say someone drank alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not represent an attack on the religion, but they exaggerated in how they treated people.\u201dAt one point, Mr. Ghamdi was assigned to review cases and tried to use his position to report abuses and force agents to return items they had wrongfully confiscated, he said.He recalled the case of an older, single man who was reported to receive two young women in his home on the weekends. Since the man did not pray at the mosque, his neighbors suspected he was up to no good, so the Commission raided the house and caught the man red-handed \u2014 visiting with his daughters.\u201cOften, people were humiliated in inhuman ways, and that humiliation could cause hatred of religion,\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said.In 2005, the head of the Commission for the Mecca region died, and Mr. Ghamdi was promoted. It was a big job, with some 90 stations throughout a large, diverse area containing Islam\u2019s holiest sites. He did his best to keep up, while worrying that the Commission\u2019s focus was misguided.In private, he looked to the scriptures and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad for guidance on what was halal and what was haram, and he documented his findings.\u201cI was surprised because we used to hear from the scholars, \u2018Haram, haram, haram,\u2019 but they never talked about the evidence,\u201d he said.Realizing the gravity of such a conclusion for someone in his position, he stayed silent and filed the document away.But his conclusions would, soon, emerge.Kaust followed the precedent of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, which had also been shielded from clerical interference, highlighting one of the great contradictions of Saudi Arabia: Regardless of how much the royal family lauds its Islamic values, when it wants to earn money or innovate, it does not turn to the clerics for advice. It puts up a wall and locks them out.Most clerics kept quiet out of deference to the king. But one member of the top clerical body addressed the issue on a call-in show, warning of the dangers of mixed universities: sexual harassment; men and women flirting and getting distracted from their studies; husbands growing jealous of their wives; rape.\u201cMixing has many corrupting factors, and its evil is great,\u201d said the cleric, Sheikh Saad al-Shathri, adding that if the king had known this was the plan, he would have stopped it.But mixing was in fact the king\u2019s idea, and he was not amused. He dismissed the sheikh with a royal decree.From his office in Mecca, Mr. Ghamdi watched, frustrated that the clerics were not backing a project he felt was good for the kingdom.So after praying about it, he retrieved his report and boiled it down to two long articles that were published in the newspaper Okaz in 2009.They were the first strikes in a yearslong battle between Mr. Ghamdi and the religious establishment. He followed with other articles, went on TV and faced off against other clerics who insulted him and marshaled their own evidence from the scriptures. His colleagues at the Commission shunned him, so he requested \u2014 and was swiftly granted \u2014 early retirement.Once off the force, he questioned other practices: forcing shops to close during prayer times and urging people to go to the mosque, requiring face veils, barring women from driving.Each comment lit a new inferno. A woman once asked him on Twitter if she could not only show her face, but also wear makeup. Sure, Mr. Ghamdi said, setting off new attacks.Harsh responses came from the top of the religious establishment.If the clerical attacks on Mr. Ghamdi were loud, the blowback from society was more painful. His tribe issued a statement, disowning him and calling him \u201ctroubled and confused.\u201d His cellphone rang day and night with callers shouting at him. He came home to find graffiti on the wall of his house. And a group of men showed up at his door, demanding to \u201cmix\u201d with the family\u2019s women. His sons \u2014 he has nine children \u2014 called the police.Before the dust-up, Mr. Ghamdi had also delivered Friday sermons at a mosque in Mecca, earning a government stipend. But the congregation complained after he spoke out, and he was asked to stay home, later losing his pay.Mr. Ghamdi had not broken any laws and never faced legal action. But in Saudi Arabia\u2019s close-knit society, the attacks echoed through his family. The relatives of his eldest son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e called off their wedding, not wanting to associate their family with his.\u201cAre you with your brother or with me?\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said his sister\u2019s husband had asked her. \u201cShe said, \u2018I am with my brother.\u2019\u201d They soon divorced.Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s son Ammar, 15, was taunted at school. Ammar said another boy had once asked him: \u201cHow did your mom go on TV? That\u2019s not right. You have no manners.\u201dSo Ammar punched him.One evening in Jidda, a university professor invited me to his home for dinner. His wife, a doctor, joined us at the table, her hair covered with a stylish veil.They had recently been married and he joked that they were meant for each other because she was good at cooking and he was good at eating. His wife chuckled and gave him more soup.I asked about Mr. Ghamdi.\u201cFrom what I read and what I saw, I think he\u2019s right and he stood up for what he believes in,\u201d the professor said. \u201cI admire that.\u201dThe problem, he said, is that tolerance for opposing views is not taught in Saudi society.\u201cEither follow what I say or I will classify you, I will hurt you, I will push you out of the discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is anti-Islam. We have many people thinking in different ways. You can fight, but you have to live under the same roof.\u201dHis wife had no problem with mixing or with women working, but did not like that Mr. Ghamdi had caused a scandal by making his views public. The royal family sets the rules, and it was inappropriate for subjects to publicly campaign for changes, she said.\u201cHe has to follow the ruler,\u201d she said. \u201cIf everyone just comes out with his own opinion, we\u2019ll be in chaos.\u201dAfter dinner, a young cleric who works for the security services dropped by. He, too, agreed with Mr. Ghamdi, but would not talk about it openly. The response, he said, is part of the deep conservatism in the clerical establishment that is impeding development.He often gave lectures to security officers, followed by discussions, he said, and a common question he heard was, \u201cIsn\u2019t the military uniform haram?\u201d Many Wahhabi clerics preach against resembling the infidels, leading to confusion.He believed that wearing uniforms was fine, and worried that such narrow thinking made people susceptible to extremism.\u201cIt\u2019s like in those American movies when they invent a robot and then they lose control and it attacks them and the remote control stops working,\u201d he said.The next day, the professor thanked me for my visit in a text message.\u201cI\u2019d like to remind u that any story that would uncover the source may hurt us. I trust your discretion,\u201d he wrote, followed by three flowers.All that was left, really, was to to speak with the Commission. What did its leaders and rank and file think about all of this? But for a force portrayed as ever-present and all powerful, it proved surprisingly shy.I could not visit Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s former office because non-Muslims are barred from entering Mecca. So I had multiple contacts ask for interviews with relatives who worked for the Commission, but they all declined to speak. I called the Commission\u2019s spokesman, who told me that he was traveling and then stopped answering my calls.I even dropped by the Commission\u2019s headquarters, a boxy, steel-and-glass building on a Riyadh highway between a gas station and a car dealership. Its website advertised open hours with the director, so I went to his office, through halls filled with bearded men milling about and slick banners proclaiming \u201cA Policy of Excellence\u201d and \u201cTogether Against Corruption.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t come today,\u201d the director\u2019s secretary told me. \u201cMaybe next week.\u201dOn my way out, two men invited me into an office and served me coffee.\u201cHow do you like working for the Commission?\u201d I asked.\u201cEveryone who chooses this job loves it,\u201d one said. It was the work of \u201cthe entire Islamic nation,\u201d and it felt good \u201cto bring people from the darkness into the light.\u201dThe other man had been on the force for 15 years and said he preferred working in the office.\u201cYou rest more in the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cOut there we have problems with people. They call us the religious police. Criminals! Thieves! You never get to rest out in the field.\u201dA scowling man appeared in the doorway and told me that I was not allowed to talk to anyone. The first man soon left. The second offered me more coffee, then tea, then forced me to take a bottle of water when I left.The first irony of Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s situation is that many Saudis, including members of the royal family and even important clerics, agree with him, although mostly in private. And public mixing of the sexes in some places \u2014 hospitals, conferences and in Mecca during the pilgrimage \u2014 is common. In some Saudi cities it is not uncommon to see women\u2019s faces, or even their hair.But there is a split in society between the conservatives who want to maintain what they consider the kingdom\u2019s pure Islamic identity and the liberals (in the Saudi context) who want more personal freedoms. Liberals make cases like Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s all the time. But sheikhs don\u2019t, which is why he was branded a traitor.The second irony is that this year, Saudi Arabia instituted some of the reform Mr. Ghamdi had called for.In April, the government responded with a surprise decree defanging the religious police. It denied them the power to arrest, question or pursue subjects, forced them to work with the police and advised them to be \u201cgentle and kind\u201d in their interactions with citizens.Mr. Ghamdi applauded the decision, although he remains an outcast, a sheikh whose positions rendered him unemployable in the Islamic kingdom.These days, he keeps a low profile because he still gets insults when he appears in public. He has no job, but publishes regular newspaper columns, mostly abroad.Near the end of our last conversation, his wife, Jawahir, entered the room, dressed in a black abaya, with her face showing. She shook my hand, exuding a cloud of fragrance, and sat next to her husband.The experience had changed her life in unexpected ways, she said. And like her husband, she had no regrets.\u201cWe sent our message, and the goal was not for us to keep appearing and to get famous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was to send a message to society that religion is not customs and traditions. Religion is something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Valuation Quirks Help End Proposed Polycom-Mitel Merger", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsOverpriced Silicon Valley unicorns are not the only technology-sector valuation oddities. Polycom, a struggling videoconferencing company, and its Canadian rival Mitel Networks just created one by scrapping their merger deal.Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management originally played matchmaker. Last October, the activist hedge fund bought stakes in Polycom and Mitel and urged them to unite. With Polycom as buyer, Elliott reckoned the stock would more than double in a couple of years. About six months later, the idea came to fruition, albeit with the smaller Mitel acquiring Polycom for $2 billion.The cash-and-stock deal offered a 22 percent premium to Polycom shareholders, who also would have owned three-fifths of the enlarged entity. An anticipated $160 million of annual synergies, worth some $1.3 billion once taxed and capitalized, should have foretold plenty of upside.Even so, as often happens with technology companies generating little or no growth, investors were unimpressed. Polycom\u2019s revenue had tumbled 10 percent and its operating income by a third since 2011. Mitel lost money in each of the last three years. Both are under threat from larger competitors such as Cisco as well as from new workplace communication tools offered by the likes of Facebook and Slack.With the deal worth 20 percent less than when it was struck, Polycom last week decided to abandon it in favor of an all-cash offer from the private equity firm Siris Capital. The price is 9 percent lower per share than the original Mitel bid, and Siris will keep all the benefits of any savings. Yet shares of both public companies rose on the news. Though part of that was because of investors who bet on the deal\u2019s prospects unwinding their positions, the episode exemplifies the strange prism through which investors see tech opportunities.In addition to the riches heaped on fast-growing start-ups like Uber, Microsoft can pay a 50 percent premium to buy a weakening but hyped LinkedIn for $26 billion, promise no synergies and still receive a warm reception from the market. A company like Polycom, with dubious prospects, is rewarded more generously for facing its struggles in private than embarking on a money-saving merger with another public company. The same logic used to build tech products doesn\u2019t always get applied when valuing them.An earlier version of the headline on this article misspelled the name of one of the prospective merger partners. It is Polycom, not Ploycom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chasing Pok\u00e9mon, a Baby Step Toward Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In this season of random assassinations and political uproar, who could resist the temptation to supplement a high-strung and frightening reality with some gentle make-believe?It is, in essence, digitally enhanced bird-watching: Find fantastic creatures like Weedle and Golbat in the wild, collect as many as possible, and get personal satisfaction and bragging rights from doing so.To answer that question, I downloaded the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, which involved giving up my rights to trial by jury, agreeing that my content could be the game\u2019s content but the game\u2019s content would never be my content, and stating I was not on the United States government\u2019s list of prohibited or restricted parties. There were also many other clauses I didn\u2019t bother to read.Then I charged my phone and proceeded to Dolores Park, a deeply green expanse in the center of the city that was the site of San Francisco\u2019s first large planned Pok\u00e9mon Go event on Wednesday.It was 69 degrees, a perfect summer evening. The app told me I was passing the place where the poet Robert Frost was born. A plaque marked the spot, which was a location in the game. Pok\u00e9mon quoted Frost:Such was life in the Golden Gate:Gold dusted all we drank and ate,And I was one of the children told,\u201cWe all must eat our peck of gold.\u201dThis was a promising omen, Pok\u00e9mon telling me interesting things I never knew about a locale steps from my office. In the park, people spread languidly, smoking dope and playing with their dogs, not a care in the world. Slowly a group congregated near a statue of Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican independence. It was nearly all young and overwhelmingly white. In other words, it looked like Silicon Valley \u2014 although with a greater female presence.Everyone stared down at their phones, catching the creatures that the app superimposed on the landscape. Aaron Orcino was drinking a can of beer he had brought along. The appeal, he said, \u201cwas the randomness. You don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\u201dBut surely he had other excellent options for an evening\u2019s entertainment?\u201cNo, this is the best thing,\u201d he said.He was kidding, a bit. Mr. Orcino works at Facebook, and so at least some of his interest was professional. \u201cI am studying it, learning the dynamics,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see how long people can continue playing before Pok\u00e9mon has to introduce a new game play element\u201d \u2014 up the stakes, in other words.Fifty years ago, the F.B.I., worried that the youth of America might foment revolution, would infiltrate San Francisco demonstrations. Now the tech companies are doing the monitoring, wondering if games like Pok\u00e9mon represent a threat that must be neutralized or an opportunity to be exploited. That\u2019s progress for you.For what seemed like a long time, it wasn\u2019t clear if anything would actually happen in the park. Television journalists did interviews. Haagen-Dazs distributed free ice cream. Less than three weeks old, Pok\u00e9mon Go was fulfilling its destiny as a marketing and media opportunity.Finally we set off, perhaps 200 of us. A larger and somewhat more diverse crowd, maybe 600 or so, departed from the opposite terminus, the Ferry Building, and marched in our direction. Like just about everything else involving new technology, the size of the projected crowd had been seriously overhyped.We walked, collecting Pok\u00e9mon along the way. Sergio Gonzalez was carrying a bottle of Veuve Cliquot Champagne, which he generously shared. \u201cThis is my childhood coming into fruition,\u201d said Mr. Gonzalez, a sommelier who was 9 in 1996 when the original Pok\u00e9mon debuted. \u201cI\u2019m reconnecting with my generation.\u201dHe turned to the woman he was walking with. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to hang out, let\u2019s be formally introduced,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Sergio.\u201dI read an email from Michael Saler, the author of \u201cAs If: Modern Enchantment and the Literary Prehistory of Virtual Reality\u201d and an expert on the augmented life that technology companies are creating for us.He was guardedly optimistic. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go is making everything new again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the enticement of the hunt, but coming across other people doing the same thing. These apps are going from pure fantasy games to helping us appreciate reality a bit more. It shows that nature and fantasy aren\u2019t opposites, that they can come together.\u201dMr. Saler added: \u201cWe always think of these innovations as a new heaven on Earth or the ninth level of hell. But it\u2019s never one or the other, there are always disadvantages and advantages.\u201dInstead, there was widespread enthusiasm for getting people outdoors by any means possible. People on our trek agreed this was little short of a miracle.\u201cIf you had told me a week ago I should go outside, I would have said, What?\u201d said Anton, a programmer who declined to give his last name. He said he now played Pok\u00e9mon Go for hours at a time, running in parks to collect the animals.That\u2019s one way to look at it. Another, of course, is that the game tethers people even more firmly to their devices in the one place they used to be able to at least partly escape from them: outdoors. On the Pok\u00e9mon Crawl Survival Kit, posted on the Facebook page, among the items to bring was a \u201cphone charger and portable charge.\u201d Many did, their phone cables disappearing into their backpacks.I tried to take the train home to the East Bay, but something was obstructing the track. BART, perpetually overcrowded and frequently overwhelmed, said there would be no trans-bay service, perhaps for hours. It recommended a trans-bay bus but, in the crowd-counting spirit of Silicon Valley, I\u2019d estimate there were at least 9,000 people at the terminal.There was nothing to do but summon Uber, which informed me that surge pricing was in effect and that normal fares would be somewhere between double and triple. My usual $5 trip home cost $76. Another peck of gold for Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Royal Troon\u2019s Twists and Turns, One Tiny Patch of Green Stands Out", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byTROON, Scotland \u2014 Short holes have done some major damage this golf season. Consider, with sympathy, Jordan Spieth\u2019s Masters disaster of a quadruple bogey on Augusta National\u2019s par-3 12th, which measures 155 yards.As the British Open returns to Royal Troon on Thursday, it is best, then, to worry about the par-3 eighth, the shortest hole on the Open rotation at just 123 yards and one of the most famous.It is named the Postage Stamp because of its small green, even if the rectangular green is shaped more like a mailing label.It has also been called the wee beastie; this is Scotland, after all. There have been holes in one here during Opens past. Gene Sarazen pulled his off in 1973 at age 71 with a 5-iron. Ernie Els had one in 2004 using a pitching wedge and the slightest of head winds, and then he exchanged high-fives with caddies and playing partners.But there has also been plenty of pathos. One of the many to come to grief at the Postage Stamp is Tiger Woods, absent this year but very much present in 1997 when he put his tee shot into one of its many bunkers in the final round and recorded a triple-bogey 6.It could have been worse, much worse. A German amateur named Hermann Tissies shot a 15 on the hole in 1950.Royal Troon\u2019s members have their moments, too.\u201cI\u2019ve picked the ball up here and just walked around the corner,\u201d Gerry Gavin said as he played the Postage Stamp during a round last month. \u201cToday was an exception.\u201dIt was an exception because on this fine, warm June day, the sky was blue and the breeze virtually nonexistent. Gavin ended up with a par 3, as did his playing partner, Stuart Lundie.\u201cEven for the members, it\u2019s the easiest hole on the course, and it can also be the hardest,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cWe never play in these conditions, with no wind. Sometimes I play a 3-iron here. Today it\u2019s a wedge. So that gives you an idea of the difference.\u201dRoyal Troon has a number of unusual features. There are the blind tee shots at the 10th and 11th holes. There is Blackrock House, a private home inside the boundaries of the course, next to the second hole. The 11th is known as the Railway Hole for good reason: It runs close enough to the tracks that the trains need reinforced glass to protect against errant golf balls.The railroad, bringing commuters south from Glasgow, played a major role in the development of classic courses on the west coast of Scotland such as Troon and nearby Prestwick, the original site of the British Open.Troon also has a bear of a back nine, usually played into the wind, but it is the tiny Postage Stamp that has become the club\u2019s signature hole and primary clubhouse talking point.\u201cI think the only conversation piece sometimes is how many did you score at the Postage Stamp?\u201d said Douglas McCreath, a golf historian at Royal Troon.That status will be underscored at the Open as it returns to Troon for the first time since 2004. With Sky Sports taking over as the Open broadcaster after the BBC\u2019s long run, there is a search for a new look and new camera angles.\u201cThere is now a wire cam going over the top of the Postage Stamp, which is the first time it\u2019s ever been done at an Open venue,\u201d said Kieron Stevenson, the head professional at Royal Troon. \u201cIt\u2019s offset about 20 yards to the left of the hole, which should really give the viewers the chance to appreciate the shape of the shots guys will hit in there. It depends so much on the wind.\u201dOpen organizers have also added additional grandstand seating around the hole compared with 2004. This busy, scenic section of the course \u2014 where the seventh, eighth and ninth holes converge \u2014 is the closest thing Troon has to Augusta National\u2019s Amen Corner. It once had a similar nickname of its own.\u201cThe name was Tattenham Corner,\u201d McCreath said. \u201cIt came from horse racing and from the Epsom Derby, where Tattenham was one of the great parts of the course. The term was fashionable here in the 1920s, but in my time, I\u2019ve never heard it used.\u201dThough Troon Golf Club was founded in 1878, the Postage Stamp and Railway Holes did not exist in their current form until they were constructed in 1909.\u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing that these two holes from 1909 still feature as iconic holes in the year 2016,\u201d McCreath said.In 1909, however, the eighth was not known as the Postage Stamp. It was called Ailsa after the rocky island Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde which is visible \u2014 when the rain is not sheeting down \u2014 from the elevated tee.According to McCreath, the name change was not made official until the 1950s but was already common usage because of an article in Golf Illustrated in 1922 by William Park in which he described the green as being the \u201csize of a postage stamp.\u201d\u201cThis William Park is sometimes confused with being Willie Park, but it\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d McCreath said, referring to Willie Park Jr., a two-time winner of the Open.The hole got another of its signature features in 1922: a deep rectangular bunker tucked into the base of the sandhill that abuts the green. It is now known as the Coffin bunker.\u201cIt was done for the 1923 Open to stop people deliberately landing it on the hill and rolling it onto the green,\u201d McCreath said.Mission accomplished, and the Coffin bunker has since buried many a golf ball and hope of a great round.\u201cI think the worst place to be is up against the back lip of that bunker,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cSometimes you just have to pick up and move on.\u201dThe week before the Open, Henrik Stenson of Sweden tried another method during a practice round.\u201cHe was in the Coffin bunker, and it took him 3 or 4 to get out, and so he kicked it out,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cIt was really nice footage on Facebook.\u201dClearly, the Postage Stamp has made the transition quite smoothly to the social-media age, but it may be in for another transition. As part of the preparations for this year\u2019s Open, the green was cut farther forward than before, creating a new pin position at the front of the green. There is also a new tee position at the front of the tee box.\u201cOn one of the four days, if the weather conditions are correct, they will get the hole under 100 yards,\u201d Stevenson said.Stevenson sounded excited, but then he has happier memories than most on the Postage Stamp. In his first year as club professional in 2008, he was playing with a foursome that included Billy Payne, the chairman of Augusta National. He used a 52-degree gap wedge off the tee.\u201cIt bounced once, checked and then dribbled into the hole,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cSo we put a nice bottle of whisky behind the bar, and we had a wee celebratory drink afterwards, so that was nice. I haven\u2019t had a hole in one since.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the direction the railroad takes commuters to Royal Troon from Glasgow. It takes commuters south, not north.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s how I found myself driving across an island, under a volcano, over an ash plain and through a forest to a tiny village called Lamakara on Tanna, an island in the South Pacific country of Vanuatu. This particular village is home to the John Frum movement, which believes that an American with that name who appeared there more than half a century ago is the Messiah.\u201cWe are happy to see you,\u201d said Isaac Wan, the bearded village chief, who was surrounded by rail-thin men in tattered Western attire. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d His English was pretty good.I shook his withered hand in the hot sun, then presented, with ceremonial panache, $20 and some goody-bag trinkets from Australian fashion week. Giggling children emerged from behind trees and pigs snorted in gardens where chickens clucked and yams grew.\u201cPlease come and we can talk,\u201d Chief Isaac said.We sat down in a thatched hut in the village\u2019s dusty dirt square.An American flag flapped in the distance on a crooked pole carved from a tree trunk.I found myself saluting it, something I would never have done back home in the States. Then I got out my ukulele and found \u201cGod Bless America\u201d coming out of my mouth.More children approached and sat down to listen. Women, too, and then more men, several introduced to us as the chief\u2019s sons. I sang with pompous fervor.I knew my audience. These are people, after all, who love America more than I do.There are many versions of how this came to be. One describes how in the 1930s, a white man in military garb appeared (according to Chief Isaac, his grandfather had seen him) to tell the people of Tanna to shed the Christianity the missionaries had brought them and to reclaim their old customs. His name was John Frum, and although he was by most accounts only a spirit, he told them plainly (in their language) that if they would reclaim their traditions, America would come one day to improve their lives with radios, trucks and other wondrous conveniences.It may sound bizarre to us \u2014 turn back to age-old tradition and you will have Coca-Cola and Frigidaires. But to the people here, John Frum\u2019s prophetic words were true, because suddenly American troops were arriving from a nearby island where they had set up a World War II base.But it wasn\u2019t just the magic of telephones, fans, canned food and other cargo arriving from crucifixes in the sky that surprised them. Unlike the French and British who had colonized the area (then known as the New Hebrides), the American soldiers were respectful. They gave the people uniforms, learned their names, trained them and paid them well. They also showed them how American soldiers of all races worked together as equals.But it all ended all too quickly, and the men, music and magic machines were gone.To this day, Chief Isaac and his fellow believers have celebrations for which they dress in their approximation of American military uniforms and march with bamboo poles that are supposed to be rifles. They fly our flag, they sing our songs.And even though Chief Isaac found our pace, noise and pollution unsettling when he visited here in 1995, he still loves America.\u201cYou saved us from the Japanese and have always been good to us,\u201d he said.I told Chief Isaac and his circle about our Memorial Day and July 4 weekends. I also promised to send them a flag, then shook all their hands.\u201cBefore you go,\u201d one man said, \u201cwill you play your song again?\u201dAs I did, singing, \u201cfrom the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, white with foam,\u201d I started to feel a catch in my throat and I had to take a breath to keep from crying.\u201cIt\u2019s very complicated,\u201d I explained to my young driver as we left in the golden late afternoon light that gave the village a quality of vanishing into mist. \u201cWe\u2019re having an election that makes people like me cynical about our country, which seems to be controlled more by business than idealism. We have all kinds of problems with poverty, guns and prejudice. Being proud to be American is hard for some of us right now.\u201d\u201cBut in Vanuatu, we only love America,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have only been good to us.\u201dHe asked that when I send a flag to the John Frum people, I send him one, too.The other day I mailed off a box of American flags (purchased at a big-box store where the variety of options was astonishing) along with two perfectly good cellphones that I never use.I often think about my visit to the village on the other side of the world and feel as if I\u2019ve been reset to have a little more hope, if not faith. We may have things to be ashamed of, but there\u2019s plenty to be proud of, too. Maybe we are all at least a little better than we know. Maybe it takes a cult group with a belief system far stronger than mine to remind me what to look for in this world: if not the magic, then at least the good.Bob Morris is the author of \u201cBobby Wonderful,\u201d a memoir.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does This Flag Make You Flinch?", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Race/RelatedTo protest police violence, an artist resurrected an old N.A.A.C.P. flag about lynching. I wondered if provocative art could help a divided nation confront its past and present.Supported byWhen I saw a photograph in my Twitter feed last Thursday of a protester holding a flag in Union Square, it was difficult to look away from the flag\u2019s blocky, capitalized type. \u201cA Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday.\u201d It shouted the words so matter-of-factly that I felt myself physically flinch.The flag waved unadorned, just black and white, with a word that seemed to invade all my senses: lynched. As a digital designer who works with illustrators and is constantly wrestling with how to boil down complex stories into an immediately understandable visual language, I couldn\u2019t help but pause and recognize the flag\u2019s potent simplicity.Both incidents set me on a hunt for visual expression \u2014 photographs, graphics, GIFs and art \u2014 that would help me understand how our country and the world was processing what had happened. I called a friend in Dallas and we talked about our surprise, as people of color, that so many people didn\u2019t seem to see or feel what we did. We wondered if there was any way for an America we had come to see as even more divided than we\u2019d thought to ever be reconciled; I wondered if art could help.Wading through the flood of imagery, I first noticed the powerful photographs and videos of people\u2019s interactions with the police \u2014 images of protest that were being shared around the world. Like many others, I was especially moved by the balance of peace and impending violence in the photo below of a woman calmly standing as police officers in full SWAT protective gear rushed toward her.But I kept coming back to that flag, and similar pieces of artwork that used simple typography and high contrast black and white \u2014 work that seemed to be saying, \u201cIf you still don\u2019t get it, let me break it down for you in language and with a visual style that you (and I) cannot escape from.\u201d\u201cThere are so many rules now that we have to uphold when interacting with the police,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\u201cIt\u2019s like all of these things, which other cultures do by the way, are now punishable by death,\u201d he added.The work of Mr. Smith and other artists seems to come from a place of empathy, and wanting to evoke it in others. Their hope, and mine, is that when individuals really take the time to understand what others are going through then it will open their hearts and minds.\u201cIt\u2019s been three years ago today that the Black Lives Matter movement started and I posted the hoodie image,\u201d Mr. Smith said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m happy that people are starting to wake up to the fact that this is a huge issue. I just want people to care. I think compassion is so important. If people can view my artwork and feel compassion, then I think that we can work through all these issues together.\u201dI wondered if the flag was creating a similar response.Mr. Scott took that flag and updated it, adding the phrase, \u201cby police.\u201d When I tracked him down here in New York, he explained his motivation.\u201cA lot of my work draws on history and shows how the past sets the stage for the present, but resides in the present in a new form,\u201d he said. \u201cThis work does just that.\u201dMr. Scott said his goal was to direct people toward the history of \u201clynch mob terror\u201d and how the police have more recently played a similar role. \u201cI think that saying a man was lynched by police actually brings up an important history in this country in a way that I think people get,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not spontaneously how they view it.\u201d\u201cHaving the videos enables all sorts of people who otherwise might not believe what black people are saying about how the police brutalize and murder us,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cAt this point, people can\u2019t say they don\u2019t know. At this point, people are making a choice to believe an illusion that the police are there to serve and protect anything other than this system.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not touched by these videos, there is something wrong with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI was crying. I have a son. And I fear for him, but I feel for all the sons and daughters and people in general. But frankly I\u2019m afraid of the police.\u201dTerror was something we both found ourselves discussing at length \u2014 how it\u2019s changed, and hasn\u2019t.\u201cBy and large, it\u2019s the police that are carrying out that role of terror and who are not being brought to justice,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cI want people to think about that.\u201dHe said that he, the gallery and the For Freedoms co-founders decided together, after the videos of Mr. Sterling\u2019s and Mr. Castile\u2019s deaths came out, to display the flag, which had been in his studio. Bringing it to Union Square was a bit of a spontaneous decision.\u201cI emailed Hank Willis Thomas, one of the co-founders, and asked him if we could add another piece to the show. And with commercial galleries, this unusual request was something that is just not done. Their response was, \u2018How quickly can you get down here with it, come now and let\u2019s put it up.\u2019 But as we were measuring it to put on the wall, we also knew this demonstration was happening and we said, \u2018Look, let\u2019s just go there.\u2019\u201dJoeonna Bellorado-Samuels, the director of the Jack Shainman Gallery, said \u201ceveryone felt a sense of urgency \u2014 even the owner of the gallery, Jack. He was the first one to say it should go.\u201dMr. Scott said the \u201cresponse has been overwhelmingly positive.\u201dBut it\u2019s also been complicated. Some visitors to the Jack Shainman Gallery whom I met this week expressed dismay at the flag\u2019s provocative language, but accepted that it was a necessary evil.\u201cDread Scott doesn\u2019t make it easy for you,\u201d said Janet Henry, an artist who was visiting the gallery. Her friend Kathy Reiss, a psychologist, agreed.\u201cSince my mom was a Holocaust survivor, I grew up learning that the world is an unsafe place and this is just a reminder of that,\u201d Ms. Reiss said. \u201cI just feel really sad and angry that we still have to use language like this.\u201d\u201cA few times a day the police will drive by the gallery,\u201d said Ms. Bellorado-Samuels.She added that during a two-hour conversation with police officers concerning the flag, \u201cThey said, \u2018We will see you at the next protest. Be sure to come over and say hello.\u2019\u201dStanding outside the gallery below the flag, I wondered how people who saw it were coping with the terror it reflected.\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe anymore. Just waking up every morning wondering if I\u2019m next,\u201d said Chris McCormick, an architect who is black and visited the gallery on his lunch break to see the flag. \u201cI even asked my boss if I could work from home.\u201dWatching Mr. McCormick struggle to articulate the flag\u2019s meaning to him, I could relate to how overcome with emotion he was. I think the best that art can do is force us to face our problems \u2014 within ourselves and within our society. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to face such deeply ingrained failures, but either you\u2019re on the side of taking it in, or you\u2019re not.\u201cThis flag is a lot. It\u2019s the past, it\u2019s the present. It\u2019s the future,\u201d Mr. McCormick said his voice cracking. \u201cI needed to take a moment to come here and think about my ancestors and what it all means. To see a week of violence was too much.\u201dMr. McCormick clearly found meaning just standing in the flag\u2019s presence. But it will no longer hang over the street.On Thursday, Jack Shainman, the gallery\u2019s owner, said his landlord threatened to sue if the flag stayed up. Reached Friday, a property manager for the landlord said the gallery\u2019s lease says nothing can be affixed to the building\u2019s facade so the flagpole and the flag had to be removed.The flag itself now hangs inside the gallery, in another stunning echo of history: In 1938, the NAACP stopped flying the \u201cA Man Was Lynched Yesterday\u201d flag after their landlord threatened eviction.An earlier version of this article and a picture caption misspelled part of the name of the adverising agency that posted a message explaining the emotions of black co-workers. It is Wieden & Kennedy, not Weiden & Kennedy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is a Police Shooting a Crime? It Depends on the Officer\u2019s Point of View", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byThe black teenager had just reached into his waistband for what the New York City police officer assumed was a gun. As the officer, Richard Haste, later told a Bronx grand jury, he thought he was about to die.In that instant, Officer Haste pictured Thanksgiving, with everyone gathered around, except him. He imagined his girlfriend walking their dog, without him, according to an account of the officer\u2019s testimony provided by his lawyer, Stuart London.Officer Haste fired a single shot.The longstanding official deference to the viewpoint of police officers is enshrined in the laws of some states and Supreme Court rulings. And the ambush attacks that left eight officers dead in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La., this month left many in the country with a jarring sense of the dangers of police work.\u201cThe legal standards we have do not hold police sufficiently accountable for their conduct,\u201d said Anthony L. Ricco, a New York defense lawyer whose clients over the years have included both a police officer accused of killing an unarmed black man as well as a man who murdered an officer.Of particular frustration for the movement, organized under the banner Black Lives Matter, is that the legal standard focuses not on the guilt or the innocence of the person who is shot but on whether an officer would have perceived a threat in the encounter. And, some legal experts said, there is the possibility that racial biases may account for why a particular encounter felt dangerous. If officers tend to respond more aggressively toward black suspects as opposed to white suspects in similar situations, Mr. Ricco said, \u201cwe allow this mind-set to become the standard by which we judge these cases.\u201dWhile there have been indictments in a few recent high-profile killings by the police, like in Chicago and South Carolina, both of those cases involved video recordings that contradicted officers\u2019 accounts.\u201cThat\u2019s the routine over and over again,\u201d said Arminta Jeffryes, an activist who began protesting the police after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict the officer who placed Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold in 2014.In the absence of criminal prosecutions, the frustration of many people is compounded by the sense that police departments frequently avoid a public reckoning of what may have gone wrong and why.In some jurisdictions, including New York City, the details of internal police investigations into shootings are kept secret.While police departments sometimes bring disciplinary proceedings against officers for excessive force, the process can be protracted or opaque.The case of Officer Haste, who shot Mr. Graham in 2012, is instructive. The officer was initially charged with manslaughter, but a judge dismissed the indictment after concluding the grand jury had received improper instructions that led the panel to give insufficient weight to how the encounter appeared from Officer Haste\u2019s perspective. A second grand jury declined to indict Officer Haste.This year, after a long review, the Justice Department also declined to seek charges. But Officer Haste still faces departmental charges in a disciplinary proceeding, which was delayed pending the criminal investigations. When the disciplinary proceeding will happen is unclear.In the meantime, the city agreed to pay $3.9 million to Mr. Graham\u2019s family.While police disciplinary cases can be drawn out over many years, some cities are taking the opposite approach in lawsuits after high-profile killings. Municipalities are expediting their resolution, settling them before depositions are taken or much evidence is turned over. Sometimes cities even pay before a lawsuit is filed, as New York did when it paid $5.9 million to Mr. Garner\u2019s family. With claims being settled so quickly, the circumstances of some deaths receive little public accounting.\u201cThe police officer usually escapes criminal accountability, a lawsuit is settled providing some monetary compensation and we move on,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens and is on a congressional task force on police-community relations. \u201cThat\u2019s not sufficient to break this vicious cycle that the country is now in as it relates to the tensions between the police and communities of color.\u201dThe policing profession is starting to debate whether departments should be more ready to acknowledge mistakes made by officers, even in cases where the shootings may be found legally justified. The bar for acceptable police work \u201ccan\u2019t simply be whether what he did is criminal or not,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy group.Mr. Wexler\u2019s group, which works with many police chiefs, recently urged departments to add use-of-force restrictions that would go beyond the law\u2019s requirements. Many agencies already do so, with Mr. Wexler citing the New York Police Department\u2019s rule against shooting moving vehicles, from 1972, as an example.Many officers say this is appropriate given the realities of the job: They are issued guns and obligated to confront danger and unlawful behavior. Forced to make split-second decisions during sometimes chaotic encounters, the police deserve significant protections under the law, especially when things do not go as planned, supporters of the legal standard say.\u201cBeing a police officer is a very dangerous job,\u201d Mr. London, Officer Haste\u2019s lawyer, said, \u201cand danger comes upon you instantaneously.\u201d\u201cMistake, panic, misperception or even poor judgment by a police officer does not provide a basis for prosecution,\u201d the Justice Department noted in its report explaining its decision not to seek charges against the Ferguson officer who killed Mr. Brown in 2014.And it could well shield the officers involved in the two police shootings of black men currently troubling the nation, in Falcon Heights and Baton Rouge. \u201cThose would both be hard prosecutions to bring because in both cases the victims were actually armed,\u201d said Paul Butler, a Georgetown law professor and former federal prosecutor. \u201cThe law gives a lot of deference to police officers.\u201dWhile the current legal standards for evaluating police shootings are unlikely to change significantly, some civil rights lawyers say there is some room for adjustments written into the law itself. If police departments raise training standards and add restrictions to use-of-force policies, the perspective of a so-called reasonable officer might evolve as well, and so will the line between lawful and unlawful shootings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo Edges Toward Its Sale With a Limp", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byYahoo said that its revenue in the second quarter fell 15 percent, after excluding accounting adjustments, and its operating profit fell 64 percent.Yahoo also acknowledged that Tumblr \u2014 its biggest acquisition under its current chief executive, Marissa Mayer \u2014 was now worth only one-third of the $1.1 billion that Yahoo paid for it in 2013.But investors were not focused on the quarterly numbers or Yahoo\u2019s vast overpayment for Tumblr. They were far more interested in whether Yahoo\u2019s web, email, news and other businesses will finally be sold \u2014 and at what price.Ms. Mayer had little to say about the potential sale in a webcast with investors to discuss the results. She noted that the company had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d on the strategic review process but offered no timeline for a decision.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s flailing business will make it difficult to get top dollar for the company. According to the research firm eMarketer, Yahoo will get about 1.5 percent of the world\u2019s digital ad revenue this year, down from 2.1 percent last year. By comparison, Google is expected to command 30.9 percent of the market and Facebook is expected to garner 12 percent.Analysts expect the final bids to come in at $3.5 billion to $6 billion, including Yahoo\u2019s land and patents.The write-off of most of the value of the Tumblr blogging network is emblematic of the failure of Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategy to expand Yahoo by luring the mobile young users who drive the business of its chief rivals, Google and Facebook.Yahoo said it was writing off an additional $482 million of Tumblr\u2019s purchase price on top of the $230 million write-off it took in the first quarter.In the second quarter, Yahoo\u2019s revenue was $1.31 billion, up from $1.24 billion in the same quarter a year ago. But the most recent quarter\u2019s revenue rose only because of a change in how Yahoo accounts for revenue from its search partnership with Microsoft. Excluding those changes, revenue fell 15 percent, and both search ads and display ads posted significant drops.The company reported a net loss of $440 million, or 46 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss $22 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the Tumblr write-off and other adjustments, the company\u2019s operating profit fell 64 percent.Shares of Yahoo were down slightly in after-hours trading Monday evening.Ms. Mayer noted that one bright spot for the industry, video advertising, was beginning to see price drops in the face of a glut of inventory as Facebook, Twitter and others churn out more live video and clips. \u201cThere\u2019s so much video, particularly mobile video, coming online that there is some price compression,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joshua Brown, Who Died in Self-Driving Accident, Tested Limits of His Tesla", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byCANTON, Ohio \u2014 Joshua Brown loved his all-electric Tesla Model S so much he nicknamed it Tessy.And he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving hands-free. In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45,000 miles on the car.\u201cI do drive it a LOT,\u201d he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen Tesla-themed videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion.They also tend to be people who like to live on technology\u2019s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown\u2019s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a 3-D printer to make model tanks and trucks.His Tesla, in other words, was simply one more extension of his technology-driven life. It took him on far-flung adventures from the gravel driveway of the pale-blue clapboard house where he lived alone in Canton, an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland.The driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.\u201cHe liked it mainly because it was an exceptional use of technology, and Josh was very much an innovator,\u201d said his friend Paul Snow, who recalled how excited Mr. Brown was about his Tesla during a recent road trip. \u201cHe enjoyed the fact that technology was available, that it was being used to, ironically, increase safety on the roads.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s most recent video was his most popular. Titled \u201cAutopilot Saves Model S,\u201d it shows Mr. Brown driving on an interstate highway from Cleveland to Canton. A white truck cuts in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s vehicle, and by his account, the Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature swerves the car to the right, avoiding a collision.After Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s founder, called attention to the video on Twitter, it went viral.Mr. Brown seemed to be elated.\u201cHe had said, \u2018For something to catch Elon Musk\u2019s eye, I can die and go to heaven now,\u2019\u201d said a neighbor, Krista Kitchen, choking up. \u201cHe was absolutely thrilled \u2013 and then a couple weeks later he died.\u201dMs. Kitchen said Mr. Brown, 40, had just left a family trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando. His relatives did not respond to requests for comment. At Mr. Brown\u2019s house, behind an expansive, well-trimmed lawn, a man who answered the door on Friday said the family did not wish to speak to reporters.Ms. Kitchen and others described how Mr. Brown would eagerly share his Tesla with friends, letting them take turns behind the wheel. And they described a man who was broadly generous with his time, who consistently helped friends in need, and who stayed in touch with his fellow veterans.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cHe was certainly an adventurer,\u201d Mr. Snow said. \u201cHe was a warrior that served proudly for his country; he was a patriot. He did many things that had never been done before.\u201dMr. Brown was particularly interested in testing the limits of the Autopilot function, documenting how the vehicle would react in blind spots, going around curves and other more challenging situations.\u201cThis section in here is going to be very, very difficult for the car to handle,\u201d he said in one video, posted in October, as his vehicle rounded a curve. \u201cWe\u2019re filming this just so you can see scenarios where the car does not do well.\u201dMark Vernon, a high school classmate who recalled tinkering with electronics in shop class together, said that his friend showed off the self-driving feature on a recent visit at Mr. Brown\u2019s home.\u201cHe knew the hill that it would give up on, because it couldn\u2019t see far enough,\u201d Mr. Vernon said. \u201cHe knew all the limitations that it would find and he really knew how it was supposed to work.\u201dMr. Brown attended the University of New Mexico, where he studied physics and computer science, but did not graduate, the school said. Instead, he joined the Navy, where he served for more than a decade and specialized in disarming explosives, according to his company\u2019s website.His service included a stint with the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team 6. Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said he had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree.\u201dTesla owners tend to share a love of technology, and an eagerness to embrace the unknown, the untested or the unproven. Photos posted on Mr. Brown\u2019s Facebook page show a love of the outdoors, where he rappelled down cliffs and jumped out of airplanes for fun.\u201cHe\u2019d probably fly an F-18 to test-drive it,\u201d she said, referring to the military fighter jet.Tesla enthusiasts often also share a loyalty to the company, much the way Apple has engendered true believers whom it relies on to back the introduction of new iPhones, Macs and other products.Richard Henry, 26, who bought a 2015 Model S about nine months ago, uses Autopilot to take him through about 40 miles of freeway driving on each leg of his commute between San Francisco and Mountain View.When he started using his car\u2019s Autopilot mode, it had a tendency to lose track of the highway lines and tell him to take control. But in the last few months it has improved more and more. Most days he turns it on and sits with his hands on his knees \u2014 ready to take the wheel, he pointed out.Learning about the technology and getting used to it has been \u201csuperfun,\u201d he said. That is a point that separates him from the many other drivers who tend to learn how to use a few necessary functions in their car and never bother with most others. \u201cI really like trying stuff like this out and understanding how the technology works,\u201d Mr. Henry said.Mr. Brown\u2019s enthusiasm for technology factored deeply into his work at Nexu, which specialized in setting up internet access in rural areas of the country where forests and mountains created special obstacles to entering the connected world.\u201cThe big companies wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d Ms. Staneski said, adding that Mr. Brown had become a mentor to her son. \u201cIt was too difficult, or they just wanted to charge you an extreme amount of money, whereas Josh felt that we deserved a chance that everybody else had.\u201dRachel Abrams reported from Canton, Ohio, and Annalyn Kurtz from New York.

And the rest is history.It was noticeable that Laurent Koscielny, the France defender he muscled aside, was weary. He had started the game with his left knee wrapped in bandages. France\u2019s other central defender on Sunday, Samuel Umtiti, was playing only his third game for the national team. Umtiti, 22, lacked the experience to spot the danger and get across to cover for Koscielny.\u00c9der, no youngster himself at 28, took his chance of a lifetime and shot from 25 yards out.France was threadbare at center back because injuries to Rapha\u00ebl Varane and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu ruled the two defenders out before the Euros could even start. It also could not pick Mamadou Sakho, the man known as \u201cThe Beast\u201d for his speed and daunting strength.Sakho had defended for France at the 2014 World Cup. But the 6-foot-2 center back for Liverpool was told in late April that he had failed a drug test while playing in a Europa League match against Manchester United in March. He had reportedly tested positive for a fat burner and was given an initial 30-day suspension.Liverpool subsequently lost the Europa League final to Sevilla. France could not take the risk of selecting him. And so it went to the Euros depleted.Last Friday, just 48 hours before the final between France and Portugal, a UEFA panel met in Paris and dismissed the case against Sakho. A London lawyer, Mike Morgan, established that the fat burner, a supplement commonly used by bodybuilders, was not on the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s list of prohibited drugs. Sakho, who had been chided about his weight by a top official when he played at his previous club, Paris St.-Germain, missed out on the end of the Premier League season. He might have made a difference for the club in the Europa League final \u2014 which gives the winning team a place in the Champions League.Liverpool Coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp simply told reporters that the \u201chard time is over for Mama.\u201dBut need it have been such a hard, and potentially costly, time for all involved? For Sakho, for his club and for his country?UEFA, the governing body for European soccer, is in somewhat of a state of limbo at the moment. Its president, Michel Platini, was barred from office after the Swiss authorities accused him of improperly receiving a $2 million payment from FIFA and Sepp Blatter, who also is barred from the sport. Platini\u2019s secretary general at UEFA, the Swiss lawyer Gianni Infantino, then switched organizations when he was elected president of FIFA. So while the 24-team, 51-game Euros played out in Platini\u2019s home country \u2014 it was very much his own project to expand the European Championships \u2014 there were interim leaders at the top of the organization. Infantino was in the Stade de France when the European Cup was handed to Portugal\u2019s captain, Cristiano Ronaldo. Platini was not.And neither was the unfortunate Sakho.Among the torrent of facts and figures released by UEFA before the final was the announcement that of the 1,878 blood, urine and serum samples taken in doping tests since January, all were negative.No one, not even Sakho, was now under suspicion.Vouillamoz added, \u201cTo my knowledge, the disciplinary committee will decide fairly quickly on the case. Information was taken from experts, documents were passed to the defense of the player.

After two minutes of free-fall, you must position yourself to land on a net less than half the size of a football field, spread out 200 feet above the earth.Mr. Aikins began his dive at an altitude of 25,000 feet, just 4,000 feet short of the summit of Mount Everest. Viewers watched him plummet, legs and arms spread, stomach down. Around 18,000 feet, he removed his oxygen mask and passed it to one of the three parachuted assistants diving with him.

So, here we are.On Friday, the 24-year-old Manhattanite threw open the doors to a spectacle worthy of the finest Instagram filter: a Museum of Ice Cream.Ms. Bunn, who is a creative strategist with clients that include Facebook and Instagram, and Manish Vora \u2014 her boyfriend and a museum co-creator \u2014 understand their target audience: millennials who need to prove to the rest of social media that they were out somewhere doing something really fun.The Museum of Ice Cream promises to tap into childlike memories of summer days and ice cream cones. It combines those dreams with adult spending power: In the gift shop, premium sprinkles are sold for $11, next to $33 cone-shape iPhone cases.Like with any successful marketing campaign, the appeal is calculated. Ms. Bunn said she carefully estimated the investment return of creating a space that would appeal to people willing to pay $12 to $18 to attend New York\u2019s latest culinary exhibition. (It\u2019s not necessarily an outlandish price: The cost of one ticket wouldn\u2019t go terribly far at other popular New York City ice cream establishments, like Black Tap or Big Gay Ice Cream.)Ms. Bunn said she had looked into experiences at \u201cother price points,\u201d like getting coffee, \u201cbut nothing is going to foster that same joy that a scoop of ice cream does.\u201d Taking the ticket prices into account, the museum has probably made somewhere between $360,000 and $540,000.

Gonzalez, a director of retail leasing for TF Cornerstone.Still, Mr. Vora described the profit as \u201ca break-even process at best.\u201dMr. Vora and Ms. Bunn call this museum a \u201cpassion project,\u201d but the elements of corporate marketing here are not subtle \u2014 more than 30 so-called partners or sponsors are affiliated with the museum, including the chocolate brand Dove, which provides samples, and Fox, which sponsored an entire room.In one room dedicated to ice cream cones, the wall is covered in vague, uncredited trivia \u2014 \u201ccones damaged during production are further ground down into animal feed\u201d \u2014 and guests can suck on a helium-filled balloon made of heated sugar.Next door, in an ice cream scoop room, guests can take a scoop of vegetable shortening laced with sugar and deposit it in a huge bowl to help make \u201cThe World\u2019s Largest Ice Cream Sundae.\u201dThe experience is oddly satisfying. But, I asked, how can it be an ice cream sundae if all we\u2019re doing is spooning lard into a bowl?\u201cYou know social media,\u201d Eyan Edwards, who was minding the scoops, replied. \u201cIt\u2019s all about looks.\u201dThere is a chocolate room, which has an almost sickly sweet smell of syrup. There is a chocolate bean bag in the middle of the room, where Ms. Bunn flops and beckons guests to look at the swirling liquid chocolate projections on the wall.In one corner, a chocolate fountain spews brown fluid onto a white counter \u2014 unappetizing, to say the least.After bypassing the odd little fountain, guests are treated to the museum\u2019s main attraction: a room with a swimming pool full of rainbow \u201csprinkles.\u201d The sprinkles are tiny bits of hard plastic that embed themselves between your toes for hours after the experience is over.Still, it\u2019s fun, and there are only a few rules: Take off your shoes, make a wish and don\u2019t dive.At the sight of shoeless people milling around in a pool of plastic, I had to ask: Isn\u2019t this some sort of health hazard?\u201cWe have replacement sprinkles, so don\u2019t you worry,\u201d answered Mr. Vora, who was busying himself by sweeping up sprinkles from the floor with a broom and dust bin.Beyond the swimming pool is a room created by Irwin Adam Eydelnant, who used his Ph.D. in biomedical engineering to start the Future Food Studio, based in Toronto.\u201cThis is an art installation meets an ice cream shop meets a taste experiment,\u201d Mr. Eydelnant said of the final exhibit he developed: \u201cmiracle berry\u201d candies that transform a lemon slice placed on top of a dollop of soft-serve vanilla ice cream into a sweet taste instead of sour.Finally, it was an experience that evokes the Willy Wonka flair the museum creators sought.But that sugar bubble is popped in the nearby gift shop, where $110 gold ice cream necklaces are on sale next to a giant seesaw that looks like an ice cream scoop \u2014 sponsored by the app Tinder.Of course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questions Over Melania Trump\u2019s Speech Set Off Finger-Pointing", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byCLEVELAND \u2014 The Republican Party woke up to a cascade of finger-pointing and confusion on Tuesday as the Trump campaign was rocked by accusations that parts of Melania Trump\u2019s convention speech had been cribbed from the one that Michelle Obama delivered to Democrats in 2008.The disarray was evident as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and senior Republicans offered conflicting explanations for the similarities in the speeches, with some officials conceding that the passages were lifted and demanding accountability, and others arguing that nothing untoward had occurred.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, there was a palpable sense of frustration that Ms. Trump\u2019s speech, which they considered a highlight of the evening, had become a cause for embarrassment.Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, pushed back aggressively against accusations of plagiarism and even tried to go on the offensive.Describing it as \u201ca great speech,\u201d Mr. Manafort said at a morning convention briefing that \u201cobviously Michelle Obama feels very similar sentiments toward her family.\u201dDeflecting questions about the passages themselves, Mr. Manafort instead attacked Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, for what he said was an effort to draw attention to the matter.We analyzed the second night of the Republican National Convention in real time. The highlights.\u201cThis is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she seeks out to demean her and take her down,\u201d Mr. Manafort said on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work against Melania Trump.\u201dSurrogates for Mr. Trump mused aloud on Tuesday about what might have happened, raising questions about fissures within his team and allowing the controversy to drag on.One adviser to Mr. Trump, who has assisted in the drafting of some of his speeches, acknowledged that Ms. Trump used words that were not her own. \u201cI\u2019m sure what happened is the person who was helping write this plucked something in there and probably an unfortunate oversight \u2014 and certainly Melania didn\u2019t have anything to do with it,\u201d the adviser, Sam Clovis, a Trump campaign co-chairman, said in an interview on MSNBC.Katrina Pierson, another spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, acknowledged that Ms. Trump used phrases similar to those used by Mrs. Obama but insisted that the language was not copied verbatim.She said in an interview with Sky News that Ms. Trump was trying to echo themes expressed publicly by prominent women including Laura Bush and Elizabeth Dole.\u201cShe really wanted to communicate to Americans in phrases they\u2019ve heard before,\u201d Ms. Pierson said.\u201cWhoever signed off, the final signoff that allowed this to go forward, should be held accountable,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said on CNN. \u201cI think if it was Paul Manafort, he would do the right thing and resign.\u201dTwo people briefed on the process, who insisted on anonymity to discuss such a sensitive issue, said that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had commissioned a draft of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech from two former speechwriters for George W. Bush.Matthew Scully and John McConnell, who had worked together as speechwriters during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term, wrote a draft of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech in June, sending it to the campaign for review about a month ago.The pair did not hear back from the campaign until about 10 days ago, according to one person familiar with the conversation, when they were told that the lineup of speeches and the timing of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech had been changed, leading to the speech having to be shortened. Ms. Trump then worked with a person from within the Trump organization to make substantial revisions.The speech-writing duo was not aware that the speech had been significantly changed until Ms. Trump delivered it on Monday night. According to one source, the only parts that remained from the original draft were the introduction and a passage that included the phrase \u201ca national campaign like no other.\u201dMr. Scully is a veteran Republican speechwriter who wrote an early draft of a speech for Senator John McCain\u2019s vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Mr. Scully had prepared a generic version of the speech and then rewrote it during an extended session with Sarah Palin, after he learned she was Mr. McCain\u2019s choice.Mr. Scully also helped write the acceptance speech given by Paul Ryan when he was chosen as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in the 2012 presidential campaign.Here are the relevant passages:Ms. Trump, Monday night:Mrs. Obama, in her 2008 speech: Ms. Trump: Mrs. Obama, in 2008: Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have thus far declined to identify who, if anyone, on the campaign helped in writing the speechIn a statement released hours after the speech, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, Jason Miller, was vague about how it was crafted.\u201cIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania\u2019s team of writers took notes on her life\u2019s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cMelania\u2019s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it a success.\u201dSarah Hurwitz, a White House speechwriter who composed Mrs. Obama\u2019s 2008 address, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but Democrats were watching the fallout carefully.Advisers to Hillary Clinton said they decided to take a restrained approach to the controversy. The Clinton campaign often challenges the integrity of the Trump campaign, but doing so over the speech could create an opening for Trump advisers to suggest that Mrs. Clinton was to blame for the furor.After Mr. Manafort tried to do so anyway on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, replied \u201cnice try, not true\u201d on Twitter and added, \u201cblaming Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t the answer\u201d for every Trump campaign problem.Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who has also been an Obama adviser, argued that the controversy revealed an inability among people closest to Mr. Trump to talk about his character.\u201cThe person who is supposed to know the candidate best and can speak to his values and what drives him couldn\u2019t write her own speech on it,\u201d Ms. Cutter wrote in an email. \u201cInstead, she lifted from a first lady who spoke from the heart about her husband.\u201dAt the White House, Josh Earnest, the press secretary, said he would leave the analysis of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech to reporters. But several times, he emphasized the positive reviews that Mrs. Obama received when she delivered her remarks in 2008.\u201cShe received an enthusiastic reception and strong reviews because of her words and her life story and the values that she and her husband deeply believe in and try to instill in her kids,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.A few minutes later, he emphasized that when it comes to Mrs. Obama, \u201cher words and her values and her life story are quite powerful.\u201dAccusations of plagiarism are not unknown in political speeches, although the consequences have varied.When Mr. Biden was running for president in the 1980s, he faced questions about plagiarizing speeches from Robert F. Kennedy, Hubert H. Humphrey and Neil Kinnock, a British Labour Party leader. Mr. Biden said at the time that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to expect a politician to attribute everything he said.Mr. Hill, a television journalist who was recently laid off, said that one of Ms. Trump\u2019s lines \u2014 the words \u201cstrength of your dreams\u201d \u2014 caught his attention as he was watching on his computer from a Starbucks in Los Angeles, juggling Facebook chats and browsing Twitter. He tracked down the clip of Mrs. Obama\u2019s speech online and noticed that parts of the two speeches were nearly the same.\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s legit plagiarism,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Hill, who described himself as a supporter of President Obama. \u201c\u2018Someone took this piece and plugged in their own information.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quotation. It was Jason Miller, the Trump campaign\u2019s senior communications adviser (not Stephen Miller, a speechwriter) who said: \u201cIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania\u2019s team of writers took notes on her life\u2019s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking.\u201dMichael D. Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reasons to Believe the A.I. Boom Is Real", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byBitsArtificial intelligence is booming. But why now?The movement can be thought of as a spread of computing intelligence everywhere, on wheels and wings, in your pocket and all through your house. That\u2019s a big enough idea to fund scores of companies, and quite possibly set up the next Silicon Valley boom. And bubble.Yet it\u2019s worth asking how much of this is reality and how much is wishful thinking. Why is A.I. growing the way it didn\u2019t over the last several decades, despite promises that it would?The answer to that lies in the precursors to this A.I. moment, which more than anything has to do with the Google-led search boom 10 years ago.In 2006, Google and Yahoo released new methods of analyzing the quirky real-world data they were picking up from doing search. Data from browsers can be thought of as a proxy for human behavior, as people wander the web. It\u2019s typically called \u201cunstructured\u201d data, as opposed to the more regular information of things like banking and airline schedules that filled most of the world\u2019s databases.That new way of seeing the real world helped make search profitable and also enabled companies like Facebook to look into even stranger social behavior. The success also gave these companies plenty of money to plow into the problem.To money, and the first ever caches of natural behavior in digital form, add cheaper computing. In 2006, Amazon also introduced its cloud-computing business. Over the last decade, retail cloud computing has become an inexpensive way for lots of people to work on data analysis and pattern finding, the heart of A.I.Only one more thing was needed, and in 2007 Apple came out with the iPhone. Let that stand for browser-type natural data collection moving off desktops and blowing through the natural world. Along with other cheap sensors tied to the cloud, it has given us huge amounts of data about all sorts of things.That created many more places where computers could do what they\u2019ve always done, which is to seek efficiency. That has created a cycle:more observation, more machine learning of patterns, more value capture funding more observation.It\u2019s enough to make you believe in this boom.What could make you believe it\u2019s also a bubble? Start with the name, artificial intelligence. So far there is zero evidence we will be about to build machines that possess intelligence or will really think on their own. If big money goes into that stuff, run for the hills.Advertisement"}

But on Thursday, Vox Media took another step in its evolution from start-up to mature business and embraced a more traditional executive role.The company, with a stable of sites including Vox, the Verge, Recode and SB Nation, named Melissa Bell, its vice president for growth, as its publisher. Vox Media briefly had a group publisher in 2013, but no one has occupied the position since January 2014.\u201cWe thought about the publisher title, and in different industries and at different times, it\u2019s meant different things,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media. \u201cMelissa\u2019s job is going to be focused on continuing to grow our brands.\u201dIn her new role, Ms. Bell, who left The Washington Post in early 2014 to help start Vox.com with Ezra Klein, will help develop the company\u2019s brands and identify opportunities to build its audience on its sites and across different platforms, such as Snapchat and Facebook. She will work not only with the company\u2019s sales and product teams, but also with its editorial team.Publishers traditionally oversee their organization\u2019s business operations while editors make editorial decisions, a separation that many in the news media industry view as necessary to maintain editorial integrity. But Vox Media is not the first company to also give its publisher editorial responsibilities.In March, for instance, Tribune Publishing, now known as Tronc, an abbreviation of Tribune online content, announced that it was combining the role of editor and publisher at its newspapers, which include The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times. As the line between business and editorial sides at media organizations continues to blur \u2014 many news organizations, for example, now have in-house agencies that work with advertisers to produce ads that look like articles \u2014 more companies could decide to expand the publisher role.Ms. Bell, 37, will not determine which articles Vox Media\u2019s sites will publish. That job will still belong to the individual editors in chief, who will continue to report to Lockhart Steele, Vox Media\u2019s editorial director. Rather, Ms. Bell said she would work with the editors in chief to determine how and where to best tell their stories.\u201cWhat we want to do is to have the E.I.C.\u2019s have the authority and the autonomy to own their own brand voice,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I can do is help shape that.\u201dNaming a publisher is the latest move by Vox Media, which has among its investors NBCUniversal and the private equity firm General Atlantic, that suggests it is looking to operate within a more traditional business structure. In April, the company named its first chief financial officer, and recently appointed its first chief technology officer.\u201cWe are a growing company that is figuring out how to structure ourselves,\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cWe are no longer a small start-up but we really, really want to keep that scrappy spirit alive, and we\u2019re trying to figure out how to shepherd that as we grow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Attacker in Nice Plotted for Months and Had Accomplices, French Prosecutor Says", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byHowever, although the Islamic State called the attacker one of its \u201csoldiers,\u201d there is as yet no evidence that he or the suspected accomplices had any direct contact with the terrorist network, the prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, who handles terrorism investigations in France, said at a news conference in Paris.Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian who lived in Nice, drove a cargo truck through crowds that had gathered on the city\u2019s waterfront promenade to watch the Bastille Day fireworks on July 14. He also fired an automatic pistol at the police, before they shot and killed him.The authorities initially said they believed that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, who had not been particularly religious, had become rapidly radicalized over a few weeks before the attack. But on Thursday, Mr. Molins suggested that the attack had been planned for months. Investigators have confirmed \u201cnot only the premeditated character\u201d of the attack but also that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel \u201cbenefited from support and complicity in the preparation and carrying out of his criminal act,\u201d Mr. Molins said.The five suspects, who were arrested in the days after the attack, were charged on Thursday evening. Mr. Molins said that the charges would include murder, attempted murder, terrorist conspiracy, and the possession and transportation of weapons.Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s estranged wife was also arrested, but was released without charges on Sunday, as was a man who had been wrongly identified as a suspect, according to Audrey Delaunay, the man\u2019s lawyer.Mr. Molins also said that investigators had uncovered pictures, text messages and phone calls that showed he had been in close contact over the past year with three men who are now suspects. The authorities identified them as Ramzi A., 21, a native of Nice and a dual French-Tunisian citizen; Chokri C., 37, a Tunisian born in Sousse, Tunisia; and Mohamed Oualid G., 40, a dual French-Tunisian citizen born in La Marsa, Tunisia.Mohamed Oualid G. and Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel called each other 1,278 times over the last year. Mohamed Oualid G. sent Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel a text message praising the attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, Mr. Molins said, and investigators found pictures on Mohamed Oualid G.\u2019s phone of the aftermath of the attack in Nice.Investigators also found pictures on Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s phone from July 11 and July 13 of Mohamed Oualid G. in the truck used for the attack, he said.On April 4, Chokri C. sent Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel a Facebook message advising him to \u201cload the truck\u201d and to \u201ccut the brakes, my friend, and I\u2019ll watch,\u201d Mr. Molins said. His fingerprints were also found on the truck\u2019s passenger door, and he was recorded by a surveillance camera in the truck beside Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, on the promenade in Nice, less than three hours before the attack, Mr. Molins said.Documenting devastation along a one-mile stretch of waterfront.A text message sent by Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel to Ramzi A. just minutes before the attack thanked him for an automatic pistol, which he then used to shoot at the police, and \u201casked for new ones,\u201d Mr. Molins said.Like Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, none of the men were known to French intelligence services, Mr. Molins said. Ramzi A. had a criminal record with convictions for theft, violence and drug use between 2013 and 2015.An Albanian couple \u2014 Artan H., 38, and Enkeledja Z., 42, who also holds French citizenship \u2014 also face criminal proceedings. They are suspected of having helped Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel obtain the 7.65-millimeter automatic pistol that he used.Questions continued to be raised about security measures in Nice on the night of the attack, which killed not only French citizens who had been celebrating their national holiday, but also people of 19 other nationalities, including citizens of Algeria, Brazil, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Madagascar and the United States.Survivors of the attack in Nice, France, describe a windy night at the beach, fireworks, and then terror.France\u2019s Socialist government has sparred repeatedly with opposing politicians on the right and far right, especially local officials in Nice, over how many national and municipal officers were securing the promenade on the night of the attack and how they were spread out. The national police answer to the state, whereas municipal officers answer to city authorities.Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, while denying that accusation, has ordered an internal police investigation, separate from the continuing judicial one, which will look into the Bastille Day security measures in Nice.Questions have also been raised about why the authorities did not position heavy obstacles at the entrances to the promenade\u2019s pedestrian area, to block vehicles from entering.The latest extension, which would last until the end of January, would make this state of emergency the longest since the 1950s.In addition, legislation passed on Thursday gives the government new powers. For example, under the state of emergency, the police will be allowed to seize computers and phones and copy the data on them without prior judicial authorization. And from now on, the government will be able to place a person returning from Syria or Iraq under house arrest for up to three months instead of one.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Paris, and Lilia Blaise from Nice, France.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deflategate Is Over: Tom Brady Ends Appeals Process", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOn Pro FootballThe long national farce known as Deflategate has ended.The saga started 18 months ago as a dispute over whether the game balls had been underinflated, which would make them easier to grip and provide an advantage in passing. In the game in question, the New England Patriots romped over the Indianapolis Colts, 45-7, though most of the scoring came after the questionable footballs were replaced.The game, however, has almost become an afterthought in all that followed: A showdown between the country\u2019s most powerful sports executive and football\u2019s most decorated quarterback; a power play between the league and the players\u2019 union; courtroom drama; red-hot arguments by talking heads on television.The case went one step below the Supreme Court, to a federal appeals court, which cleared the way for the suspension to go forward and this week declined to reconsider its decision.Years from now, only legal historians will remember that at its core, Brady\u2019s case was a serious matter about the powers and independence of an arbitrator, an issue that has broad ramifications for employees everywhere.A vast majority of fans will instead recall how the fight devolved into a giant, head-scratching spitting match between a button-down league and a team widely reviled for its exceptional success on the field as well as suspicious behavior off it.Or maybe they\u2019ll just remember the scandal as absurdist performance art.How else do you explain the Patriots\u2019 head coach, Bill Belichick, perhaps the grumpiest and most tight-lipped man in the league, taking time out from planning for the Super Bowl to lecture the news media at length on the Ideal Gas Law? (Trust us, it seemed to matter then.) Or that in said lecture he let slip that one of his favorite movies was \u201cMy Cousin Vinny\u201d? (Trust him, it seemed to matter then.)Like any good scandal, there were also nicknames and suspicious pieces of evidence that blossomed into full-blown conspiracies. Thanks to a multimillion-dollar investigation by the N.F.L., we learned that one Patriots employee, Jim McNally, was called the deflator. And if the O. J. Simpson murder trial had the glove, Deflategate had the cellphone that Brady destroyed after the N.F.L. asked to see it.The intersection between sports and pop culture in America has existed at least since Babe Ruth\u2019s famous bellyache in 1925. But social media, 24-hour sports networks and the collection of outsize personalities managed to turn Deflategate into an all-consuming circus that hit its apex when a courtroom sketch artist made Brady look like Lurch from \u201cThe Addams Family.\u201dThe fact that Brady spared the highest court in the land from considering handling his case should be applauded. Brady taking his road show to Washington during a presidential election campaign might have short-circuited the internet.Then again, the N.F.L. already staged its own smackdown between Goodell and Robert Kraft, the Patriots\u2019 owner, whose mild-mannered demeanor went out the window a week before the Super Bowl last year.Fresh off a cross-country flight to Arizona, Kraft broke the clubby protocol of the league and lambasted it and his good pal Goodell at the team\u2019s welcome news conference. For good measure, Kraft wandered into the players\u2019 media circus the next day, drawing a stampede of television cameramen.Kraft was cheered in Patriots Nation for seeming to stare down the commissioner, who continues to be pilloried on talk radio from Foxborough, Mass., to the Canadian border. (Last summer, the police were dispatched to stand guard over Goodell\u2019s house in Maine.) But those same fans turned on Kraft when he agreed to pay the N.F.L. the $1 million fine it had imposed for Deflategate. Kraft took a hit again this year when he failed to persuade Goodell to return the two draft picks the Patriots were forced to give up.Over the past year and a half, more urgent matters came up, making the scandal increasingly look like an insignificant sideshow.All it took was to watch a game and see another player carted off the field, their career in jeopardy; or to read about another player arrested for domestic violence or filing for bankruptcy; or when scientists would discover that yet another deceased N.F.L. player was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease linked to repeated head trauma.Sure, sports matter in America. If nothing else, they provide temporary relief from society\u2019s troubles. But our collective consumption with the physics of slightly-too-soft footballs always felt a little, well, flimsy.Advertisement"}

Some came from an international oil deal and some from bond deals managed by Goldman Sachs.Then, the complaint said, they transferred more than $1 billion of the embezzled funds into the United States using shell companies and the client bank accounts at the white-shoe law firm Shearman & Sterling. They rose up the social ladder, spending on celebrity-studded parties, purchasing high-end real estate, financing movies like \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and buying paintings by the likes of Picasso and Monet.\u201cThe money was raised by the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund and it was supposed to be used for investments that would return profits that would be used to support the Malaysian people,\u201d Leslie R. Caldwell, the assistant attorney general who heads the department\u2019s criminal division, said in an interview. \u201cWhat happened instead was corrupt officials within 1MDB and others siphoned off a very large percentage of the money that was raised to the tune of $3 billion and used it in ways that provided absolutely no benefit to people in Malaysia other than themselves.\u201dThe forfeiture complaint, issued by a unit known as the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, represents the largest such case brought by the Justice Department. It comes at a time of heightened concern about secrecy, shell companies and illicit money flow around the world.The Justice Department named three of those people in its filings. One, Riza Aziz, is the stepson of Mr. Najib and a Hollywood film producer. Another, a financier named Jho Low, is a longtime friend of Mr. Aziz and his family. The third is Mohamed Badawy al-Husseiny, a former official at a government fund in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, that participated in deals with Malaysia\u2019s fund. Prosecutors also cited Khadem al-Qubaisi, who was an official at a related fund in the United Arab Emirates, as well as another individual who was an associate of Mr. Low.The people named in the complaint have not been charged with crimes. The defendants in an asset forfeiture case are the properties that the government wants to seize. But an asset complaint does not preclude criminal charges.Mr. Aziz\u2019s movie company, Red Granite Pictures, said in a statement that it was confident that \u201cwhen the facts come out, it will be clear that Riza Aziz and Red Granite did nothing wrong.\u201dMr. Low, Mr. Husseiny and Mr. Qubaisi did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, representatives for Mr. Aziz and Mr. Low have acknowledged that their clients own United States properties but have said that they did nothing improper.The complaint does not name Mr. Najib, but it does cite \u201cMalaysian Official 1,\u201d described as a high-ranking government official who oversaw the fund and is a close relative of Mr. Aziz.Tengku Sariffuddin, Mr. Najib\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement issued early Thursday that Malaysia would cooperate with \u201cany lawful investigation.\u201d If any wrongdoing is proved, he said, \u201cthe law will be enforced without exception.\u201d He said the investment fund had been the subject of several investigations in Malaysia and that authorities found no crime was committed.The immediate effect of the Justice Department\u2019s action is effectively to freeze the assets. The forfeiture process is lengthy. First, a court must make sure that no other interested party has a valid claim to the properties. Once true ownership is determined, the court must decide whether the money used to buy those assets was, in fact, earned illicitly. Only then can the government permanently seize the assets.In the nearer term, the government\u2019s action may increase the political pressure on Mr. Najib, who has held on to power by halting investigations into the investment fund and by removing officials in his governing party who criticized him.The 1MDB fund was created in 2009 as a \u201cstrategic development company\u201d to invest the Malaysian public\u2019s money, primarily its oil wealth, in projects to benefit the country. Mr. Low helped set up an earlier version of the fund.The Times reported last year that Mr. Low was secretly involved in major transactions with a small oil company called PetroSaudi International and Malaysia\u2019s public fund, which was led by Mr. Najib in his position as prime minister. Mr. Low then helped the prime minister\u2019s stepson buy property in the United States using shell companies and finance his movie company.The Times investigation documented property transfers between Mr. Low and Mr. Aziz, including one on Hillcrest Road in Beverly Hills that was done behind the veil of a shell company, with no property transfer filed in public records, as well as the role that Mr. Low played in helping to finance Mr. Aziz\u2019 movie business.That transaction was one of several using shell companies that were detailed in the Justice Department complaint.The complaint minutely chronicled an odyssey of embezzlement, global money flow and lavish spending in the United States.Prosecutors described several crucial transactions involving 1MDB, including the one with PetroSaudi. In that transaction, the complaint said, 1MDB officials and their associates stole about $1 billion that was supposed to be used for oil exploration. In addition, more than $2.5 billion was stolen through bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 that were managed by Goldman Sachs, the complaint said.Then, according to prosecutors, Mr. Low and the others involved in the embezzlement wired hundreds of millions of dollars into the escrow account of the Shearman & Sterling law firm. Banks generally do not do due diligence on the clients of law firms, leaving that step to the law firms themselves.PetroSaudi, Goldman and Shearman were not accused of wrongdoing. Those firms did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. 1MDB, the sovereign fund, was also not accused of wrongdoing and said in a statement that it was cooperating with investigators.According to the complaint, from October 2009 to June 2010, more than $85 million of the stolen money was spent on gambling in Las Vegas, jet rentals, yachts and payments to other individuals.It said that the $150 million used for luxury properties in New York and California came from the PetroSaudi deal, as did $44.8 million to buy a hotel in Beverly Hills and $35.4 million for a jet.Money from the Goldman Sachs bond deals, prosecutors said, was used to purchase $130 million worth of artwork at auction, as well as an interest in the music rights of EMI. It also helped finance the production of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d they said.According to the complaint, money from the bond offerings was put into a shell company in the British Virgin Islands and then transferred in part to Red Granite Pictures. Mr. Aziz and Mr. Husseiny previously told The Times the financing for the movie had come from personal funds of Mr. Husseiny, the complaint notes, even though the money came from 1MDB.In New York, the funds for the purchase of the Time Warner penthouse originated with 1MDB and were siphoned off from the PetroSaudi deal, the complaint said. The money was transferred through accounts in numerous countries but eventually landed in an account that Shearman & Sterling held for \u201cclient 37103 (TJL/RT MISCELLANEOUS INVESTMENT MATTERS).\u201d\u201cThis case is a perfect example of how shell companies can be used by criminals and kleptocrats and other people to steal money, hide money, launder money and make it very difficult for law enforcement to find out who controls that money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem globally but it\u2019s also a problem in the United States.\u201dReporting was contributed by Richard C.

Some candidates in the September elections have expressed support for those ideals or at least for allowing the public to vote on the future status of Hong Kong.Legislative Council members have previously had to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and swear they will uphold the Basic Law, which serves as a constitution regulating the territory and outlining its relations with China\u2019s central government. Under the requirements announced on Thursday, candidates will have to sign such an oath in order to run.The Progressive Lawyers Group, an association of pro-democracy barristers, solicitors and students in Hong Kong, said it was concerned that a requirement to sign such a pledge \u201ccould be a first step towards a capricious use of such statutory declarations in different contexts to achieve political ends.\u201d\u201cMost opinion polls show only a small minority of people in Hong Kong support separatism,\u201d Mr. Lam said, noting that the new requirement could actually hurt the government. He added: \u201cPeople will think it\u2019s an overreaction, a knee-jerk reaction from Beijing.

{"Headline": "China Clamps Down on Online News Reporting", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China has ordered several of the country\u2019s most popular internet portals to halt much of their original news reporting, in a move that could confine an even larger share of the journalism in the country to Communist-controlled mouthpieces ahead of an important party meeting next year.The profit-driven portals, several of which are listed on United States stock exchanges, have in recent years expanded their investigative teams to increase readership among China\u2019s more than 600 million internet users by scooping the staid state-owned news media on stories about subjects including industrial pollution, tainted milk powder and even police brutality.The edict made public on Monday, which said the web portals were in \u201cserious violation\u201d of a 2005 internet regulation, came before a meeting next year of the Communist Party Congress. The party often puts in place controls on news before important events, such as the party conclave, held once every five years, which will pick a new group of senior leaders.The news sites are run by China\u2019s biggest internet companies, which also operate social media platforms and produce some of the country\u2019s most popular online games. Sina, which runs a news aggregation service and publishes original reporting, also created Weibo, China\u2019s popular Twitter-like social media site. The companies are roughly the equivalent of the United States\u2019 largest internet companies, like Facebook, Twitter and Google, and their news sites combine articles from other outlets with original reporting and investigative journalism.Wen Tao, who until last year was a reporter for \u201cSerious Reporting\u201d at Phoenix, one of the news features shut down by the new edict, said by telephone that in recent years the news portals had played a cat-and-mouse game with government internet censors, pushing the boundaries of censorship by publishing material without submitting it for approval and waiting to see if it was taken down by the authorities.But Mr. Wen said that even in China, with its notorious army of censors, it was difficult for the government to control news in a market powered by hundreds of millions of readers hungry for news that goes beyond Communist propaganda.\u201cThe flow of information cannot be stopped \u2014 it\u2019s like a flood,\u201d Mr. Wen said. \u201cYou either need to discharge it or it will run rampant.

{"Headline": "33 Suspected of Overdosing on Synthetic Marijuana in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byThere is a word that local residents and workers use to describe a group of drug users whose presence they say has grown around a busy Brooklyn transit hub: zombies. What was once a few familiar faces has turned into a tribe of strangers, walking around, staggering and looking lost, in the throes, it is believed, of the ill effects of K2, a synthetic drug that officials in New York have been working hard to eradicate.The problem in the neighborhood has gotten to be such that a manager of an urban farm nearby, tired of the smoke wafting onto the property, posted two hand-painted wooden signs with a simple message: \u201cNo Smoking K2.\u201dEight people were taken from the Stockton Street area to Woodhull Medical Center suffering from \u201caltered mental states,\u201d lethargy and respiratory issues around 9:40 a.m., a spokesman for the Fire Department said. Others were found in the surrounding area.Even hours after the first call came in, a few erratic people could still be seen staggering around the streets under the train tracks. Some fought back against gravity by bracing their arms on parked cars or light poles. A few toppled to the ground. A video that Mr. Arthur streamed on Facebook captured responders helping an unsteady man into an ambulance; nearby, another slumped soporifically against a fire hydrant.Pairs of police officers walked the blocks around Broadway and Myrtle Avenue, checking the vital signs of men they found unconscious. Anyone who was unresponsive was loaded onto a stretcher and taken away in an ambulance.K2 has been around for many years, but its pervasiveness and popularity with homeless people caused health officials to warn of a public health crisis last summer. In 2015, New York City had more than 6,000 emergency room visits involving the drug and two deaths, according to the health department.Social service providers, however, have said that enforcement in some areas has simply caused some sellers and buyers to move to different communities. Regulars of the area around the transit hub say the use of K2 has bloomed into a larger problem in the last two to three months. \u201cYou can smell it,\u201d said Jason Reis, 34, the manager of the Bushwick City Farm, who posted signs in front of the urban green space about a week ago. \u201cThe way people are acting. They smoke it openly. And you can see them rolling it.\u201dMr. Reis described an influx of people roaming the side streets around the subway station, particularly the quiet Stockton Street block where the farm is located, sitting on benches and stoops or in front of stores, rolling and smoking K2 cigarettes, leaving trash and empty K2 packets with their garish exteriors behind, and even urinating and defecating in public.Mr. Reis said he placed the signs out of concern for the children who frequent the farm to garden and play basketball. \u201cWe were just getting a little fed up with it,\u201d he said.The police said they had recently targeted the area for arrests and seizures of K2. Residents said the drug used to be available at convenience stores in the area, but is no longer visible on shelves.City Councilman Robert E. Cornegy Jr., who represents part of the area, said that he had heard from constituents about people \u201cbugging out\u201d and making drug sales as they waited for buses or trains. Dealers, he said, use the bustling intersection, which is shaded by the overhead subway tracks, to provide cover for their illicit activity.\u201cYou can assimilate into the hustle and bustle, and that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d Mr. Cornegy, a Democrat, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to track certain behaviors in an area like that without overpolicing, which nobody wants.\u201dNury Rodriguez, 55, a hairstylist at A Cut Above, on Stockton Street, said she had grown accustomed to the group of men congregating on the street in the morning.

{"Headline": "Hot-Air Balloon Crash in Texas Kills 16, Officials Say", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byLOCKHART, Tex. \u2014 A hot-air balloon carrying 16 people caught fire and crashed in Central Texas on Saturday, officials said, and the local authorities said no one had survived.The balloon crashed in a pasture near Lockhart, a town about 30 miles south of Austin, said Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial reports from officials said the balloon had plummeted after catching fire in the air, but at least one witness said it might have struck high-tension power lines before hitting the ground and bursting into flames. The accident occurred shortly after 7:40 a.m., Mr. Lunsford said.In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Lunsford said that officials were on their way to the site and that the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. The agency will be in charge of the investigation.Mr. Lunsford said he did not know what had led to the crash or whether there had been a distress call. The Caldwell County sheriff, Daniel Law, said in a statement, \u201cIt does not appear at this time that there were any survivors.\u201dBy late afternoon, investigators had yet to publicly identify any of the victims or their relations to one another. But local news reports, quoting unnamed sources, identified the pilot of the balloon as Alfred Nichols, known as Skip. He was listed as an owner and the chief pilot of Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides.By Saturday afternoon, the comment sections for that photo and the Facebook page of the balloon company were filled with condolences and remembrances.Ms. Bartch, Mr. Grundmann and others who posted on Facebook and Twitter did not respond to private messages. Voice mail messages left late Saturday afternoon at two phone numbers listed for the balloon company were not returned.Margaret Wylie, 66, who lives a quarter-mile from the crash site, said she had seen the balloon explode into a fireball after it struck the ground on a neighbor\u2019s property. She said she had been on her back porch when her dog \u201creally started raising the roof.\u201d\u201cWhen I looked over toward my neighbor\u2019s property,\u201d Ms. Wylie said, \u201cthat\u2019s about the time I saw flames shooting out sideways, and then just a fireball. At 66, that\u2019s not something I want to see again.\u201dThe crash occurred in a rural area less than an hour from Austin, in a large field scorched from the summer heat. Several big power lines atop towers ran east and west at the field\u2019s southern end. A few farmhouses were visible in the distance.Throngs of journalists arrived by late morning, but investigators had sealed off the perimeter and kept them from the spot where the balloon had fallen.Ms. Wylie said that based on what she had heard, she believed \u201cthe balloon hit the wires, and it caused the deflation of the balloon, and then it hit the ground.\u201dShe initially heard a pop, she said, and then another that sounded like gunfire.\u201cI figured that was the balloon hitting the power line,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time I looked that direction, it was on the ground, and I heard a whooshing sound and an explosion.\u201dMs. Wylie said the balloon was so engulfed in flames that she did not see any passengers. She immediately called 911, she said.The red, white, blue and yellow balloon apparently separated from the basket and was stretched along the ground about a mile from the crash site.Asked to confirm reports that 16 people had been killed, Mr. Grosof said, \u201cRight now, we have a number of fatalities.\u201dSixteen deaths would make the accident one of the worst hot-air balloon crashes in history, surpassed only by a crash in Luxor, Egypt, that killed 19 people in February 2013.Before Saturday, the worst balloon accident in the United States occurred in August 1993 in Woody Creek, Colo., near Aspen, when a wind gust blew a balloon into a power line complex. The basket was severed and fell more than 100 feet, killing all six people aboard.The sheriff\u2019s statement said that a call had come in to the local law enforcement authorities after 7:40 a.m. reporting a possible vehicle accident.

She was seeking her first Olympic medal, and after four runs down an icy 1.1-mile skeleton course, she was sure she had succeeded.She had not. She placed fourth, finishing four-hundredths of a second behind Elena Nikitina of Russia, who took third.\u201cMy gut just got all wrenchy,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said recently, tears welling up as she slowed her pedaling on a stationary bike. \u201cIt\u2019s opening a wound.\u201dDr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account of how doping controls were breached at the 2014 Olympics has tarnished the performance of dozens of Russian athletes and marred the integrity of the Games. His claims also have left many athletes who finished behind Russians feeling cheated.\u201cI\u2019ll never know what it feels like to stand on the podium in Sochi, but I want to put this behind me,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cI want to know: Am I a bronze medalist?\u201dMs. Nikitina\u2019s name appears on a spreadsheet provided to The New York Times by Dr. Rodchenkov. The document, which he said was sent to him by Russia\u2019s sports ministry two weeks before the Sochi Games, lists key competition dates for each athlete \u2014 in Ms. Nikitina\u2019s case, Feb. 14, the date of her final two races, in which she had some of the fastest running starts at the Games.In a preliminary report last month, Mr. McLaren, who received the Sochi spreadsheet, called Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s story \u201cboth credible and verifiable.\u201dIn an interview in Moscow this week, Mr. Mutko denied that the government had been involved in any scheme, but expressed concern that his deputy was accused of giving Dr. Rodchenkov direct orders.Mr. Mutko was alternately confident in Russia\u2019s athletes and contrite about their attitudes toward performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cWe have to persuade people you can win without doping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture. It\u2019s a problem.\u201dWaiting for the Sochi inquiry to conclude, Ms. Uhlaender, who will turn 32 next week, has fought to keep her focus on the next Winter Olympics, in 2018 in South Korea. Still, she is concerned that sports officials will fail to deliver the rigorous and decisive result she craves.\u201cI\u2019m worried Sochi will be forgotten, and it scares me,\u201d she said. \u201cRodchenkov said he tampered with the samples, and there are rules against that. I just want to see them follow the rules.\u201dMs. Uhlaender is training in the desert, spending her days lifting weights in Arizona with fellow professional athletes at a high-performance gym and sprinting alongside dozens of other Olympians, mostly track and field athletes preparing for Rio.Between workouts, there is conversation of all kinds \u2014 about high-fat diets, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the price of gas \u2014 but there is little mention of the allegations of widespread doping by the Russians.Ms. Uhlaender said she had talked about the situation twice with her coach. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d he asked her before moving on.\u201cThe worst thing I can do is talk about it,\u201d she said over a chicken lettuce wrap and four shots of espresso. When not training, she meditates; works in education for a traumatic brain injury center, having recovered from a concussion herself; watches Netflix; and exchanges texts with two Navy SEAL friends who have helped keep her tough, she said.\u201cWhen I come to train, I don\u2019t want drama,\u201d she said, fiddling with a National League championship ring belonging to her father, the former baseball player Ted Uhlaender. The ring, which she tucks into the back of her sports bra as she works out, hangs on a silver chain alongside a tiny baseball charm that holds his ashes.One of the few people Ms. Uhlaender has talked to about the doping scandal in recent months is Ms. Nikitina, her Russian competitor. In May, days after Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account became public, Ms. Uhlaender and Ms. Nikitina exchanged more than a dozen messages on Facebook.Ms. Nikitina expressed shock at Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s statements. \u201cWe all think this is politics!\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe basically joke about it.\u201dShe added: \u201cEach athlete sure of himself! As we say in Russia, \u2018Such complex situations make us stronger.\u2019\u201dMs. Nikitina, who did not respond to messages from The Times, told Ms. Uhlaender her name was not on Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s spreadsheet, and she emphasized the sacrifices she had made to train twice a day to become a better athlete.When Ms. Uhlaender asked if Russian Olympians had doped at Sochi, Ms. Nikitina said that she could speak only for skeleton racers, and that the answer was no. Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s spreadsheet listed five Russian skeleton athletes, including Alexander Tretyakov, who won gold at the Games.Asked about the allegations this year, the Russian Bobsled and Skeleton Federation wrote in an email that all of its athletes \u201cunderwent doping control procedures in accordance to the rules,\u201d adding, \u201cAll of them were clean, and not one positive result was found.\u201dMr. Mutko said in Moscow this week that Mr. Tretyakov and other accused athletes had long careers with clean histories. \u201cThese athletes didn\u2019t appear in sport all of a sudden,\u201d he said. \u201cNo whiskey would be enough to stop them,\u201d he said, referring to the mixture of steroids and liquor that Dr. Rodchenkov said he developed and distributed to coaches to help Russian athletes absorb drugs more quickly before traveling to international competitions for testing.Mr. Mutko said, however, that if Mr. McLaren\u2019s inquiry proved Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account true, the athletes in question would be disciplined.\u201cI am not on the list!\u201d Ms. Nikitina wrote to Ms. Uhlaender in a recent exchange. \u201cI hope that the truth will prevail! And the perpetrators of this scandal will be punished!\u201dMedalists like Ms. Nikitina received high praise for their performance at Sochi. After the Games, President Vladimir V. Putin presented Ms. Nikitina, a first-time Olympian, with a state award, the Order for Merit to the Fatherland.Regardless of what may come of the investigation, Ms. Uhlaender called herself more determined than ever to work toward the only major title she has yet to capture in her 13-year career. \u201cI want to win Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m first, I\u2019ll know no one ahead of me doped.\u201dShe said she felt sympathy for Ms. Nikitina, whether or not the claims against her were substantiated. \u201cShe\u2019s going through something, too,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cThe shininess has been dulled for both of us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Moves One Step Closer to Light-Based Wireless Communication", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byTrilobitesThe internet is often called the \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d but it\u2019s not actually accessible to residents of a large portion of the world. Today, four billion people are offline, and 1.6 billion of them live in sparsely populated areas around the world.Most internet signals today are transmitted at high rates through wired optical fiber networks \u2014 which require expensive infrastructure \u2014 or at lower rates through wireless radio frequencies, which are limited in bandwidth, subject to regulations and vulnerable to interception.Free-space optical communication works by encoding communication signals in laser beams. Transmitters on the ground or in satellites shoot that light through the air to receivers that can decode the data. (To understand this on simple terms, think of encoding and sending information through morse code using a flashlight.)One longstanding obstacle to free-space optical communication is a trade-off between speed and size. To increase the number of laser signals hitting a receiver, one can increase the size of the receiver. But doing so makes the receiver slower.Instead, many free-space optical communication systems use smaller receivers with complex pointing and tracking systems. Because laser beams are narrow and travel in straight lines from point A to point B, these receivers have to continuously maneuver to catch laser beams head-on.The Facebook researchers\u2019 solution to this problem is a light detector that doesn\u2019t need pointing and tracking, but still allows for fast transmission. To do this, they took advantage of fluorescence, the process of absorbing light and re-emitting it at a lower energy.Facebook\u2019s detector contains a spherical bundle of special fluorescent fibers. The bundle, somewhere between the size of a golf ball and tennis ball, is able to absorb blue laser light from any direction and re-emit it as green light. Because that green light is diffuse, it can then be funneled to a small receiver that converts the light back to data.In our hypothetical example, imagine that instead of a water gun, you\u2019re pointing a blow dart gun at a water balloon attached to a funnel over the potted plant. As soon as you hit the balloon, it pops and releases water. With the addition of the balloon, you\u2019ve eliminated the need to move the pot around. You can shoot at the water balloon from any direction, and the plant will get watered.Facebook\u2019s new detector is able to achieve fast data rates of two gigabits per second \u2014 several orders of magnitude higher than those from radio frequencies \u2014 because light has a higher frequency than radio waves, and because the fluorescence process is fast. Free-space optical communication can also carry more information than radio communication, and is more secure because narrow laser beams are harder to intercept than wide radio waves.For now, the new light detector is still in early stages, said Tobias Tiecke, a communication systems scientist at Facebook and a co-author of the new paper. His team built their current device using off-the-shelf materials that are used for harvesting solar light.\u201cThe performance of our system can still be increased much further by developing materials tailored for communication,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Profit Nearly Triples on Mobile Ad Sales and New Users", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook\u2019s growth appears to know few limits. And even when one source of growth is set to slow down, the social network is ready with another.The rise was driven by strong mobile ad sales, as well as a steady ascent in its number of users. Facebook now counts 1.71 billion monthly active users, up 15 percent from a year ago. And in a sign of how indispensable the social network is to people, the amount of money the company can squeeze from each user globally jumped to $3.82, up from $2.76 a year earlier. In the United States and Canada, Facebook\u2019s most valuable markets, the company makes an average of $14.34 per user.To maintain its rocket-ship trajectory and to avoid the pitfalls of its counterparts, Facebook said it was also looking ahead and betting on what it hoped would be a major business driver in the years to come: video and video advertising.\u201cWe see a world where video is first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors.Facebook also acknowledged on Wednesday that it could not just keep cramming more ads onto the site, something known in industry parlance as the \u201cad load.\u201d Instead of increasing the number of ads in people\u2019s News Feeds, Facebook plans to sell more video advertising, which commands a premium. Other companies, like Twitter and Snapchat, have also said they will pursue this strategy, which has long been a mainstay of YouTube, Google\u2019s powerhouse video site.Facebook has been methodical about its transition to a more video-centric network. In recent years, it has introduced new tools to let people easily capture and post videos to the site, including uploading so-called native video directly to Facebook, which hosts the content itself.The more acclimated users are to seeing video content on Facebook, the thinking goes, the less disruptive it will be for people to view video ads alongside them.The push is already paying off. Facebook on Wednesday said users spend more time on the network as a result of the increase in video content posted to the site.\u201cThink about what video looks like on Facebook. The most effective video ads are really built for social,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe see even better engagement with videos that are actually put together for Facebook.\u201dFacebook has shown it is skilled at adapting to new ad formats and industry trends. As people moved away from desktops to smartphones en masse five years ago, Facebook quickly shifted its advertising business to focus on mobile sales. Today, mobile ads constitute roughly 84 percent of Facebook\u2019s overall advertising revenue.\u201cThree or four years ago, the single most important trend to figure out on the internet was mobile,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst from RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThese days, the single most important trend to figure out on the internet is video. And from a financial perspective, it seems like Facebook is figuring out the video-fication of the internet better than anyone else.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg foresees a future where Facebook is far more advanced in video than simply automatically playing them in the News Feed. He has tasked his top lieutenants to work on virtual reality and 360-degree cameras, which will aid videos and protect Facebook against fading into obscurity.\u201cJust as people used words and text to express themselves in the past, in the future more of that is going to be video,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd more of these augmented-reality tools are going to be an important part of delivering that experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Police Shootings Highlight Unease Among Black Gun Owners", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe presence of long rifles that groups like Mr. Balogun\u2019s openly carry caused some unease during Thursday\u2019s demonstrations in Dallas. The police released a photograph of a person in a camouflage T-shirt and with a gun slung around his body, calling him a suspect. But it turned out that the man had not been involved in the shooting.The shooting of the officers, Mr. Balogun said, should not be cause for black people to give up their legal guns.\u201cI don\u2019t condone the killing of anyone, black, white, brown, poor,\u201d Mr. Balogun said, adding that he nonetheless viewed the violence against the officers as a response to \u201cyears and years and years of injustice.\u201dThis is a collection of the viral footage that has prompted a national conversation about race and policing.\u201cIt terrifies me,\u201d Mr. Balogun, 32, said. \u201cHere I am telling black people: \u2018Hey, bear arms legally. You\u2019ll have a better opportunity to protect yourself. Maybe the law will respect you more.\u2019 \u201dNow angry questions are flying over whether the Second Amendment is applied evenly across races. And the killings of the officers have only deepened the fault lines between those who back the police and those who highlight their abuses.Still, black gun owners fight negative perceptions.\u201cIt\u2019s really just getting at what we know to be a pervasive stereotype of blackness and criminality,\u201d said Robin Wright, a researcher with the Kirwan Institute at Ohio State University who studies implicit bias. \u201cIf you see a black person with a weapon, you don\u2019t assume that it\u2019s legal.\u201dPut more bluntly: \u201cSkin color is synonymous with crime,\u201d said Jasmine Rand, the lawyer for a man who was shot by the police, and later died, in Florida.Even Mr. Castile had pondered the dangers of being a black gun owner hours before his death, his mother, Valerie, said in an interview with CNN. He was at her house discussing his concealed-carry permit with his sister, who also had one, Ms. Castile said.\u201cYou know what? I really don\u2019t even want to carry my gun because I\u2019m afraid that they\u2019ll shoot me first and then ask questions later,\u201d Ms. Castile recalled her daughter saying.Often in police shootings, the carrying of a gun by the victim has become shorthand for whether it was justified. But experts and activists said that ignores an important point: whether someone was doing something threatening with the weapon.While there is no data on whether legally armed white or black people are shot at higher rates in the United States, experts on implicit bias said that negative stereotypes of black people would suggest that they are at a greater risk of having their actions or intentions misinterpreted when they carry guns.But black gun advocates said that they should not be deterred from legally carrying firearms.\u201cI think there\u2019s some social realities that take place when you are an African-American male and are open carry or concealed carry,\u201d said Philip Smith, the president and founder of the National African American Gun Association. \u201cYou can\u2019t worry about that. If I went around worrying about what everybody\u2019s thinking as I\u2019m carrying a gun on my hip, I would go crazy.\u201dMr. Balogun helped found his Dallas gun club two years ago to organize and educate on the subject of gun ownership for blacks. When they openly carry their guns, they always try to travel in numbers or have a camera rolling. That is to ensure that witnesses can attest that they are not up to something nefarious.\u201cThe thought of a black male with a weapon scares America,\u201d he said. \u201cThey automatically fear that we\u2019re seeking some form of vengeance. We\u2019re not seeking vengeance. We just want to protect our community and our homes.\u201dIt remains unclear exactly what happened in the shooting of Mr. Castile in Falcon Heights on Wednesday. But the authorities said that an officer stopped his vehicle for a broken taillight. After the shooting, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend began streaming live video on Facebook while he bled to death next to her and the officer trained his gun on the vehicle. In the video, the girlfriend said that Mr. Castile told the officer he had a licensed handgun. He reached for his wallet to give the officer his identification when the officer opened fire, she said.Minnesota law allows people to carry guns with a permit obtained from a county sheriff\u2019s office.Five officers were killed and seven others were shot during a protest in downtown Dallas.Central to de-escalating situations on the streets is helping law enforcement learn their implicit biases, experts say.When three rookie police officers investigating a report of a possible burglary at a metal recycling plant came upon Earl D. Brown, a 73-year-old black man, in Lauderhill, Fla., they did not take him for a night watchman. On that night four years ago, he carried a shiny .44-caliber Magnum pistol, and the officers yelled for him to put his hands up.As Mr. Brown raised his hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m security,\u201d the officers met him with a barrage of 22 bullets, two of which struck him, according to the lawsuit.It turns out that Mr. Brown was a security guard, carrying a licensed gun, investigating a report of a burglary at the recycling center where he worked the late shift.Mr. Brown, whose family was represented by Ms. Rand, had a heart attack at the hospital and died two weeks later.A grand jury declined to indict the three officers, but it issued a stinging report saying they were poorly trained and inexperienced. It also recommended that they be suspended without pay until they were retrained. Maj.

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because Mr. Imam is a refugee himself: He fled Damascus, Syria, in 2012 after being kidnapped and tortured. He still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who his captors were, but he is reminded of the ordeal whenever he smiles, revealing a row of perfect teeth that replaced the ones his kidnappers knocked out.Soon after fleeing Syria, he volunteered at a refugee camp in Lebanon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bekaa Valley. But it bothered him that the stories reported from the camps were pretty much the same \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca copy of a copy of a copy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and never matched his own experiences there. The refugees were \u00e2\u0080\u009coverphotographed, but underseen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people I met are in the worst possible conditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they have the desire to continue being human.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Imam set out to tell the story of his fellow refugees without resorting to stereotypes, spending weeks listening to their stories in a Lebanese camp a few miles from the Syrian border. Working collaboratively, he staged and photographed scenes from \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir memories, fears, dreams and hallucinations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The refugees approved the ideas before they played out the scenes that would be photographed.The result, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLive, Love, Refugee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a set of complex, surrealistic images that reveal the emotional and psychological lives of these victims of the Syrian civil war.

Ms. Habjouqa, who marveled at his poetic images, said that while other photographers had been inside these camps, none had made such \u00e2\u0080\u009cintimate work that captures their real dreams and their real fears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before the Syrian conflict, Mr. Imam, who has an accounting degree, helped run his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s curtain manufacturing business.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Day 2", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementCLEVELAND \u2014 By saying almost nothing about Donald Trump on Tuesday night, Paul Ryan said it all.  Trump isn\u2019t the star of his own convention. Hillary Clinton is. What really animates the Republicans gathered here is their antipathy toward her, not their embrace of him. Speaker after speaker makes the case against her, not the one for him. And a weird impression is taking hold: They\u2019re filling the minutes and running out the clock with all the bad that they can dredge up about her because there\u2019s not enough good to plumb in him. He\u2019s not their shining hero. He\u2019s just their sole alternative. \u201cOnly with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance of a better way,\u201d Ryan said, and it\u2019s worth paying close attention to a few of those words. Only. Better. This was the vocabulary of resignation, not of exultation. Without hatred of Clinton, the delegates had \u2026 what? Not Trump, not on Tuesday night. He had gone back to New York City \u2014 he\u2019s always happiest in a tower with his name on it \u2014 though he beamed in via a Jumbotron to say a quick hello. He predicted victory in November. He vowed \u2014 wait for it! \u2014 \u201cto make America great again.\u201d He asked a question: \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d The response lacked energy. I took it as a no. About that promised greatness: If Trump can\u2019t ace four days in Cleveland, how\u2019s he going to ace four years in Washington? He keeps telling us what a paragon of competence and purveyor of wonder he is, but there\u2019s scant evidence of that here so far, and the mess surrounding Melania Trump\u2019s remarks is only the half of it. He promised the sun, the moon and Hollywood stars. He gave us Scott Baio. The speeches ran late on Monday. They started late on Tuesday. And so far, they\u2019ve failed utterly to do the one thing they must: sell Trump to those voters who are still skeptical about him. Chris Christie followed Ryan, and spent so much time detailing Clinton\u2019s sins that there was little left for Trump\u2019s virtues. Ben Carson followed Christie, and lavished most of his peculiar oratorical energy on Clinton, whom he linked to Saul Alinsky and, by extension, Lucifer. You had to hear it to believe it, and you had to assume that Carson\u2019s were yet another set of remarks not thoroughly vetted by the crackerjack Trump operation. Carson mustered no such grandiloquence for Trump, who had to make do with Carson\u2019s leftovers. What a rich twist. At his own coronation, someone who insists on adulation is being turned into an afterthought. It\u2019s not much of a testament to his management skills. It\u2019s not much of a testament, period. The Republican National Convention has echoed with all kinds of accusations against Democrats, but perhaps the oddest came when Dr. Ben Carson spoke to the arena Tuesday evening and suggested that Hillary Clinton may be \u2026 a devil-worshipper.  Whoah. Frankly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for an exorcism of demons\u2014and not from Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump is rising, and Roger Ailes is tumbling \u2014 and their trajectories are deeply interwoven. Indeed, Trump is the Republican nominee perhaps in part because Fox News and other prominent right-wing commentators weakened the control of Republican Party bosses. Fox News certainly didn\u2019t create Trump, and he had many disputes with it and especially with Megyn Kelly, but Fox created space that Trump filled. I disagree profoundly with much of Fox News\u2019 reporting, but it\u2019s impossible to deny its importance as a social and political force in America. Yet Ailes\u2019s apparent downfall also reflects a larger weakness as well: If he had vision, he also suffered from myopia. The ugly sexual harassment of which Ailes is accused was common a generation ago and too often was accepted as boys-will-be-boys behavior. But times have changed, and he apparently continued in the 2010s conduct that is no longer winked at and is now often (unfortunately, not often enough) taken very seriously. Ailes was stuck in the past, and now he apparently will end his career in disgrace as a result, if the reports are correct. The Republican Party suffers a similar myopia. It continues to behave as if America were in the 1970s, and its nostalgia leads it to antagonize blacks, Latinos and Muslims, as well as many whites uncomfortable with what feels to them like bigotry. In the 2000 Republican convention, George W. Bush was careful to put black faces on the podium almost nonstop, so that people joked that convention coverage looked like Black Entertainment Television, because Bush knew that he needed to come across to American centrists as tolerant and open-minded. In contrast, the 2016 convention is mostly whites all the time. Outside of the C\u2019est La Vie shindig, Omarosa Manigault \u2014 of \u201cApprentice\u201d and \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d fame \u2014 spoke to reporters. She is the very recently announced director of African-American outreach for the Trump campaign. After a testy exchange about the 0 percent poll, she admitted that Republicans do have a problem reaching black voters, but she thinks that is changing. \u201cThe movement has already started, where Donald Trump is bringing folks who have never been involved in this party here to this convention to be a part of the movement that is making America great again,\u201d she said. After Ms. Manigault departed, Ben Carson popped out to the lobby to address the reporters he loves to hate. He admitted Republicans need to do more to reach out to black voters, but argued that Democrats have done little to improve life for African-Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity right now for the Republican Party to reach out and talk about ways that you empower people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of always looking for something negative to say, they should be saying, \u2018Do you realize that Melania Trump and Michelle Obama have the same philosophy?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat means something wonderful for America, that Democrats and Republicans can grasp and elevate the same ideas. That means there\u2019s hope for us.\u201d Also on hand at this gathering of black Republicans? Herman Cain, the Godfather\u2019s Pizza magnate and 2012 candidate in the G.O.P. presidential primary. He emerged to tell reporters that he is happy for Mr. Trump\u2019s success. \u201cThe voice of the people is what caused him to get the nomination for the Republican Party, period,\u201d he said. Inside the event, an intimate group of black Republicans \u2014 including some who had not previously run for president or appeared on television shows produced by people running for president \u2014 milled about. I found Eugene Craig, a vice chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, whom I\u2019d first met last year at a campaign event for Senator Rand Paul at a historically black college in Maryland. \u201cAre you planning to vote for Donald Trump?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m bound to support the Republican nominee. As the vice chair of the Maryland Republican Party, I\u2019m bound to support the Republican nominee,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you sound very enthusiastic,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, I will say this. There are some things I want to see out of Donald Trump, absolutely. I think he has to come out strongly in favor of criminal justice reform,\u201d he responded, adding that he was heartened by Ms. Manigault\u2019s addition to the Trump campaign. As Ben Carson would say, this is a wonderful opportunity for the Republican Party. CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump, whose fortune comes in large part from renting out his name, appears to be losing control of his brand to a horde of Cleveland souvenir hawkers. Mr. Trump earns money by putting his name on everything from hotels and casinos to steaks and wine. Street vendors in Cleveland earn money by putting Mr. Trump\u2019s name on T-shirts, coolers, key chains, bobbleheads, sundresses and beer koozies. The official G.O.P. convention shops inside and outside the Quicken Loans Arena \u2014 but within the security perimeter \u2014 primarily sell hats and T-shirts with the official Donald Trump campaign logo. The Republican Party has tried to ban entrepreneurs from selling official-looking Trump merchandise, because the profits from the party\u2019s own sales benefit its campaign fund. The Future Female Leaders booth next to the arena can\u2019t sell Trump merchandise, so it sells everything but. Its name began as a Twitter account, set up by Amanda Owens for conservative young women. The women in the booth, who wear red skirts printed with tiny elephants, do a brisk business in what might be called creative conservative apparel. The biggest sellers are tank tops with the slogans \u201cAin\u2019t No Party Like the Grand Ole Party\u201d and \u201cPARTY like it\u2019s 1776.\u201d Delshaun Jackson sells his bootleg Trump T-shirts from a pop-up tent on Superior Avenue. But they\u2019re not selling as well as his own design, a shirt that reads \u201cRNC-CLE: I was here,\u201d which he figures will be a big hit if riots break out. Mr. Jackson is no Trump supporter. He says the man is \u201cso hateful that he\u2019s running on sending everybody back across the border.\u201d Besides, Mr. Jackson said, he did a lot better with Cleveland Cavaliers merchandise after they won the N.B.A. championship last month than he is doing with the famous Trump brand. After a day of hearing everyone with a microphone handy talking about Melania Trump\u2019s lifting of a passage from a speech by Michelle Obama, I had a tune running though my head. Lobachevsky, it seems, said the secret to success at mathematics is to plagiarize. \u201cOnly be sure always to call it please \u2026 research.\u201d What really jumped out after hearing Melania Trump was the line in the song about the immortal Lobachevsky\u2019s first book. \u201cEvery chapter I stole from somewhere else,\u201d the lyric goes. \u201cIndex I copy from old Vladivostok telephone directory.\u201d That was 63 years ago. Seems like it was the final word. This kind of saber-rattling and phobic speech may have seemed familiar to the snark-virtuosos on Twitch, the gigantic platform for players of (mostly) video games, which is streaming the convention this week, the company\u2019s first foray into news and politics. Twitch considers the livestream a public service to \u201cthe millions of U.S. voters who call Twitch home,\u201d most of whom, according to Quantcast, are childless Caucasian men under 24 living in lower-income households. The site\u2019s chat section is known for insult comedy, bluster and bellicosity. \u201cLib mods,\u201d perhaps, was a reproof to moderators seen to be deleting pro-Trump posts. But maybe it meant something else. At the same time, other Twitch members were invited to stream the convention on their own channels, and there they could host more pointedly ideological chats. On a channel run by rthe_donald, a Twitch member called Str8UpGankster riffed on Mr. Trump\u2019s threat that his proposed wall be built higher each time the idea is criticized. \u201cNext stop: The White House! The Trump train just got 10,000 m.p.h. faster!\u201d \u201cCrooked Hillary\u2019s prison sentence just got 10 days longer!\u201d The pugnacious language of Twitch is enlightening. It syncs up naturally with the scattershot rage in the convention site, the Quicken Loans Arena. Unlike the network pundits, the Twitch chatters didn\u2019t try to force the off-kilter speeches to conform to reasoned analysis. Instead, they repaid the convention\u2019s tone in coin. For those who wonder where the fury and fear at the convention comes from or how it registers with young voters, Twitch chat may be more useful than cautious commentary by professionals who don\u2019t share it. The hamfistedness was unnecessary. The foray was always going to be defeated. The effort to dump Trump at the convention, while honorable, had exactly the same problems as the effort to stop him in the primaries. First, it lacked the necessary leadership. Like any coup plotters (just ask the Turks), the delegates who opposed Trump needed some support within the party apparatus for their effort to have any chance. There are plenty of notable anti-Trump Republicans \u2014 senators, governors, the party\u2019s last two presidents and its most recent presidential nominee. But except for Senator Mike Lee, who led the floor fight yesterday, they were all far away from the convention. Meanwhile the party leaders who could have cracked the door to a coup \u2014 Priebus and Paul Ryan, above all \u2014 had made their peace with nominating an authoritarian buffoon. So nominate him they will. Here it\u2019s fitting that the anti-Trump effort yesterday was entangled with an inside-baseball struggle over the design of the 2020 primaries. Even as Trump trashes the party, the establishment and the grass roots can\u2019t quit their penny-ante battles, and the establishment especially can\u2019t help itself from mobilizing against the Real Threat \u2014 which is always and forever Cruz. In other words, the coup scenario required leading Republican politicians to show sustained courage and creativity for the sake of their party and their country, and other leading politicians to respond to Trump\u2019s abnormal rise by abandoning party business as usual and leaping into the unknown. And a Republican Party that had such leaders would not have found itself in this position in the first place. Buchanan was right in a way. That cultural and religious war has come to define American politics, for the worse. His speech showed the depths to which the Republican Party had fallen in practicing the dark art of the politics of fear and division. But the Republicans, it turned out, had a lot farther to fall. For President Bush in 1992, fear and division were a sideshow. Now they are the main event. On the convention\u2019s opening night, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, gave a speech that was raw anger and hatred. Giuliani\u2019s tirade swamped whatever Trump hoped to accomplish by having his wife talk about what a wonderful guy he is. Waving his arms and shouting frequently, Giuliani declared: \u201cWe must not be afraid to define our enemy. It is Islamic extremist terrorism.\u201d It\u2019s absurd, of course, but the idea is to attack the \u201cother\u201d and still claim there is no bigotry in doing so. \u201cFailing to identify them properly maligns decent Muslims around the world,\u201d Giuliani said, without explaining how, exactly. \u201cIt also sets up a fear of being politically incorrect that can have serious consequences.\u201d Trump likes to make the same claim that people who object to his attacks on Mexicans, Muslims, women and others are being \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d That is not political correctness. It is calling out bigotry and racism for what they are. Giuliani attacked Hillary Clinton over the Obama administration\u2019s decision to help depose the Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi. He said, rightly, that Libya is now in chaos. But he conveniently left out that President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to wage war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq was the gigantic blunder that set up most of the subsequent horrors in that part of the world. Giuliani\u2019s speech led nowhere in terms of actual policies or ideas, only to this rather chilling statement: \u201cIf they are at war against us \u2014 which they have declared \u2014 we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them.\u201d I can think of a couple of conditions: Basic human decency and traditional American democratic values. Giuliani\u2019s speech was effective. It whipped up the crowd in the convention hall and, no doubt, Trump supporters watching on television. It just would have been better delivered from a balcony, or at the head of a torch-bearing mob. Andrew Rosenthal is an op-ed columnist for The TimesThe main thing I\u2019ll be watching for tonight is whether Republican are in the early stages of grasping this situation. Tuesday\u2019s lineup of speakers \u2014 under the theme \u201cMake America Work Again\u201d \u2014 is certainly eclectic. It includes a soap-opera star, the president of Ultimate Fighting Championship and the general manager of Trump Winery. Sprinkled among the entertainment, however, will be many top Republicans like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy. They will each offer clues about whether Republicans understand the problem that Donald Trump has exposed. For those Republicans who have one eye on a post-Trump future, the question is which parts of Trumpism to keep. \u2013 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, speaking about Cleveland sports, at a United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce appearance in Cleveland. \nThe columnist speaks to Ralph Reed, chairman of Faith and Freedom Coalition.\nBut the unmistakable echo of Obama\u2019s words in Trump\u2019s is a bad turn for her husband and his campaign. Below are four explanations why, along with one reason that it falls well shy of a disaster. Trump is constantly telling us how incompetent everyone who\u2019s been steering the government is and how masterfully he\u2019ll take the wheel. He\u2019s incessantly crowing about what a brilliant business he manages. But his campaign keeps contradicting that. Aides come and go. He steps on his message and sullies what should be his best days. He badly bungles the rollout of his vice presidential pick, turning a potentially big media moment into the source of eye rolling and laughter. And now this. In a normal, thorough, disciplined political operation, someone is scouring all the major speakers\u2019 scripts for any potential landmines, and plagiarism is a biggie. In a normal, thorough, disciplined political operation, the person helping a speaker of Melania\u2019s stature prepare his or her remarks has a level of professionalism that greatly diminishes the possibility of what happened. Trump is once again cast as the disengaged captain of a ragtag, amateurish team. Trump\u2019s many detractors and the thousands of journalists chronicling this convention were on watch for proof that Trump\u2019s coronation had been cobbled together sloppily and at the last minute, and the hubbub over the speech\u2014which was the climax of the event\u2019s opening night\u2014confirmed such a narrative. That watch now becomes a high alert. There is no sign whatsoever that Clinton had a hand in the detection of strangely familiar lines in Melania\u2019s speech, and the assertion that Clinton feels threatened by Melania is somewhat less than persuasive. Melania has been less visible and vocal than presidential nominees\u2019 spouses typically are, a clear sign of some discomfort at the microphone. Besides which, there are three more nights of developments to overtake this one, and three and half months of cutthroat campaigning that\u2019ll turn it into a distant memory. CLEVELAND \u2013 It was odd enough that Slovenian-born Melania Trump\u2019s tribute to her husband and the value of her foreign upbringing was the crowning moment of an evening otherwise devoted to murders of children by immigrants and the ever-present threat of foreign-born terrorism. But Mrs. Trump\u2019s speech during the Republican National Convention\u2019s opening night seemed, pundits said immediately afterward, a bit remote. Mrs. Trump mentioned earlier in the day that she wrote it herself, but it was so devoid of personal detail that it could have been about anyone\u2019s family. Turns out, some of it was from Michelle Obama\u2019s family. He\u2019d been inspired by some of these same passages in Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech. So Mr. Hill looked up the speech and started tweeting. Mr. Hill\u2019s tweets went viral, retweeted more times than Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to his wife\u2019s speech. At about 2 a.m. The Trump campaign issued this statement: \u201cIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania\u2019s team of writers took notes on her life\u2019s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking. Melania\u2019s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success. -Jason Miller, Senior Communications Advisor.\u201d In cases like this, it\u2019s useful to compare the contexts in which the words appear. One difference jumps out: Mrs. Obama\u2019s words have been proven to be true, while the truth of Ms. Trump\u2019s remains to be seen. Eight years in office have shown that the Obamas\u2019 parents did teach them to treat people with dignity and respect even when they disagree with them. Ms. Trump\u2019s parents may have taught her the same thing, but she has never publicly objected to the low, nasty tone of the Trump campaign. For her part, Ms. Trump had to show that she, a rather reserved woman despite her modeling background, could speak without hesitation to a national audience. She had to be forceful, but not too forceful. She had to serve as an advocate for her husband but also, as first ladies are supposed to do, soften his harshness. Both women had to establish their very American, up-by-their-bootstraps credentials. In 2008, reporters cited the very lines that Ms. Trump seemed to have taken from Mrs. Obama as proof that her story was one of blue-collar origins, hard work and essential decency, not of Ivy League privilege. (Both Obamas had been mocked for their elite educations; Mrs. Obama graduated from Princeton.) For her part, Ms. Trump also had to show that she was a child of poverty, not privilege, however rich she may be now. Both women did what they had come to do, at least at first. And that, too, is notable, proving the power of those plagiarized words. \nThe columnists discuss the Republican National Convention.\nAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran, Once Quiet About Its Casualties in Syria and Iraq, Now Glorifies Them", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 The first news report, to a nation usually kept in the dark about military matters, was shocking: 13 Iranian soldiers, all with links to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, had been killed in an ambush near the Syrian city of Aleppo. What followed this spring may have been even more surprising. Details about the soldiers appeared extensively in the Iranian news media, which not only gave the names of the dead but lionized them with sweeping life stories. Poster-size portraits were plastered all over their hometowns.For years, Iran covered up its military activities in Syria and Iraq, so the government could deny any official involvement on the ground. Coffins arrived with the bodies of soldiers who went unidentified, referred to only as \u201cdefenders of the shrines\u201d of the Shiite saints. When the bodies began to come home in larger numbers, the state news media began calling them \u201cvolunteers.\u201dThe hard-liners, they say, want to prevent any decline in Tehran\u2019s absolute support for Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, and to undermine the moderates, who they fear might be open to a political settlement in which Mr. Assad would step down.The Revolutionary Guards see publicizing the sacrifices of the fallen as a way to build domestic support for the current Syria policy and squelch any talk of compromise. The Instagram accounts have attracted tens of thousands of followers, most of them supporting the military effort.\u201cBy being open about our role, we can prevent a diplomatic solution in Syria,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst close to Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cFirst, we must defeat all terrorists in the battlefield. Only after that can we negotiate with them.\u201dThe main focus, however, is on social media.Facebook and Twitter are blocked by the state in Iran, but the photograph-sharing app Instagram is freely accessible. Previously used mostly by middle-class Iranians showing off new puppies or vacations on the Caspian Sea, the app is now suffused with images of \u201cmartyrs\u201d and young men proudly wielding machine guns.One of the more prominent Instagram accounts is run by a reporter for Iranian state television, Hassan Shemshadi, who honors Iranian fighters and Afghans in the Iran-backed Fatemiyoun brigade.But most of Mr. Shemshadi\u2019s posts concern the increasing number of Iranian casualties in Syria and Iraq. Since he started posting news of soldiers\u2019 deaths in 2015, he has published a total of 346 mini-obituaries of Iranians and Iranian-backed Afghans in Syria and Iraq. That is a large majority of the 400 or so Iranian and Afghan soldiers thought to have died so far in the conflicts there.Mr. Shemsadi continued, \u201cThey died while defending the pure Mohammedan Islam and the holy shrines and also maintaining the national security of our country, and ascended to the heavens.\u201dMr. Shemshadi declined to be interviewed for this article.He is not shy about describing Iran\u2019s military activities in the region, a freedom of expression that would have to be permitted at the highest levels of the government. At a conference in Mashhad in February, for instance, Mr. Shemshadi said that Iran was directly involved in the Syrian conflict and that there was a danger that its Russian allies could one day stop supporting Mr. Assad.Iran is in Syria and Iraq not only to defend the shrines, Mr. Shemshadi said. \u201cIt is wrong to have a one-dimensional view of what we are doing in Syria,\u201d he said. Iran provides national security for the Syrians, too, and \u201cwe are there to show the real Islam,\u201d meaning the Shiite strain.Mr. Shemshadi was quick to respond. \u201cIt is not for the sake of another country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is for the sake of Islam, religion, beliefs, Shiism, resistance, holy shrines and so much more.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on July 10 about Iran\u2019s recent move to publicize its military activities in Iraq and Syria, instead of covering them up, referred incorrectly to the owner of an Instagram account who follows Hassan Shemshadi, a reporter for Iranian state television who posts pictures from the front lines in Syria. The owner of the account is a woman.Advertisement"}

The crowd in Cincinnati routinely broke out into cheers of \u201cNewt! Newt!\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, causing the candidate to pause occasionally and compliment his traveling partner, but he did not bring Mr. Gingrich back on the stage.Mr. Trump did promise, perhaps prodded by the cheers, that even if Mr. Gingrich was not on the ticket, he would have a presence in the campaign and a potential Trump administration.\u201cIn one form or another, Newt Gingrich will be involved in our government,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd.The campaign has said there is a short list of about 10 people being considered for the role.Advertisement"}

Dennis Crowley, co-founder and chairman of Foursquare, recently discussed the Pok\u00e9mon Go phenomenon and how Foursquare was early to location-based services. The interview has been edited and condensed:Pok\u00e9mon Go seemed to take everyone by surprise. Did the fast uptake surprise you?I thought it was interesting that it\u2019s a location-based game. It\u2019s really the first time since the original Foursquare came out in 2009 that a location-based game has really captured pop culture\u2019s attention.I\u2019ve been working in this space for a while. To see a lot of those ideas make it into something like Pok\u00e9mon, I just sit back and think that it\u2019s awesome.Did Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s fast rise frustrate you at all? Another company nailed something quickly that you guys have been trying to do for years.It\u2019s the opposite of frustration. We started working on this stuff in graduate school, and now it\u2019s exciting to see others pay attention to it. To see this succeed at this level, I think it\u2019s validating for everyone playing in the location-based gaming space for years. It\u2019s a piece of software that changes people\u2019s behavior in the real world.Have you seen any halo effects on Foursquare\u2019s business?I think we\u2019ve been beating this drum for a while. Location services are going to power everything in the future. They\u2019re going to be involved in everything we touch.One of the most interesting things is that it raises people\u2019s awareness that the game board overlaps with the real world.Developers are saying, \u201cHow do we build the next Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d The wealth of data we\u2019ve captured over the past six years, we can help be a part of that.I think what happens with Pok\u00e9mon is that people start realizing that they can use it to advertise their business, a light bulb will really go off and you\u2019ll see far more of it.It\u2019s not just an ad, it\u2019s a much more creative ad. This is what ad agencies do \u2014 they dream up crazy ideas. Now we\u2019re starting to have these conversations with them, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve built this thing. We can make something magical happen when you and your phone walk into a Starbucks, or a baseball stadium. If that\u2019s something you want to build, that\u2019s something Foursquare can power.\u201dHow many stand-alone start-ups can really do this stuff? I think it\u2019s like a \u201ccount on one hand\u201d type of thing. Google, Apple, Ingress data owned by Niantic. Our data set is 85 million places. We know latitude and longitude, but we also understand your relationship to where you\u2019re positioned when you move in, out and around those places.If Foursquare is in a strategically advantageous place after the explosion of Pok\u00e9mon, does it make sense to be a stand-alone company? Would you field acquisition offers?We always have those types of conversations as they come up, and frankly a few more have occurred in the days since Pok\u00e9mon Go came out.That said, Foursquare is a real business now. We\u2019re in a good spot where we can continue to exist and do what we\u2019re doing for the long haul.Advertisement"}

He was just getting his license and registration, sir.\u201dBy Thursday, Ms. Reynolds had given in to tears, fury and grief.\u201cShe\u2019s not calm right now,\u201d said an aunt, Joyce Doty, who lives in Indiana and was rushing to Minnesota to be with her niece. \u201cShe\u2019s a hot mess. She is very, very upset right now.\u201dOvernight, Ms. Reynolds, 26, has emerged as an extraordinary figure in the latest shooting of an African-American at the hands of a police officer.Apparently seconds after Mr. Castile was shot, she began to broadcast the scene live on Facebook, pointing her phone in the direction of the police officer, whose gun was still drawn, and at Mr. Castile, who was in the driver\u2019s seat and wearing a seatbelt, his T-shirt soaked in blood.In doing so, she became not only a poised and influential witness, but a teller in real time of her own treatment by the police.Ordered out of the car, then to kneel near the car, she was handcuffed and put in the back of a police cruiser. Yet the Facebook report continued, a mix of confusion, outrage, shock and poised determination to tell her version of what had happened.On social media and on television, Ms. Reynolds was praised for her strength. \u201cI truly believe Diamond Reynolds was spared her life because she\u2019s got a greater purpose,\u201d wrote the user @full_of_moxie on Twitter. \u201cShe\u2019s going to get justice for #PhilandoCastile.\u201dMr. Castile, Ms. Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter spent part of Wednesday running errands and going grocery shopping, she told reporters.

Some said they were praying. Others urged her to stay calm and avoid angering the officer. A few tried to ascertain where she was and coordinate efforts to go pick her up.But she was taken into police custody immediately after the shooting and was not released, she said, until police officers dropped her off at her home at 5 a.m.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for pity, I didn\u2019t do it for fame,\u201d she told the cameras and people assembled. \u201cI did it so that the world knows that the police are not here to protect and serve us.

She said on Thursday that she had no family in Minnesota. Family members said she spent her early childhood living on the South Side of Chicago. \u201cThey took my lifeblood,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThat was my best friend. I never got to say my last words to that man.\u201dDawn Spikes, Ms. Reynolds\u2019s great-aunt, said from her home in Chicago that the day had passed in a haze of confusion.

He references one of the most enduring sports photographs ever: Neil Leifer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full-color shot of a triumphant Muhammad Ali standing over Sonny Liston. That knockout was captured on motion-picture film, but Mr. Mangin said that medium still cannot do justice to the historic moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you watch the grainy black-and-white picture of the fight, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this crazy fast thing that happens that you can barely even see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mangin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can hardly tell what Ali looks like.

More than 38,000 were tested for sexually transmitted diseases, 30,000 were tested for pregnancy and about 2,400 gave birth, according to a news release from the system.Under state law, children do not need parental permission for certain sexual, reproductive and mental health care services.

We are disgusted that this might be the trigger for the destruction of the only good thing that these governments have done in 50 years: peace.\u201dMs. Seele, who is studying for the bar exam in Berlin, said that for those and other reasons, she \u201creally feels like a European.\u201d Many of her friends, as well as her brothers and sisters, have studied or worked abroad in Europe.\u201cThe fact that you don\u2019t have to exchange money anymore, that you don\u2019t have to go through border control and show your passport, it is part of the feeling that you are not leaving from one country to the other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you are still more or less in one community.\u201dMr. Gu\u00e9ry and his friends meet every three to six months \u2014 sometimes back in Berlin, but also in Brussels, Budapest and other cities. That also means more exposure to very different people and places.\u201cI never had an opinion on Norway, for example, before I moved abroad,\u201d Ms. Muscroft said. \u201cAnd suddenly one of my closest friends is Norwegian.\u201dMr. Gu\u00e9ry has been thinking about his grandparents and great-grandparents, who bore the brunt of both world wars. \u201cSo much of my family suffered from the stupidity of nationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my continent going back 50 years.\u201dWhen Mr. Gu\u00e9ry was 13, he refused to take German classes at school \u2014 \u201ca Nazi language,\u201d he thought at the time.

{"Headline": "Google Faces New Round of Antitrust Charges in Europe", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byWhen it comes to Europe\u2019s lengthy investigations into Google, Margrethe Vestager, the region\u2019s competition chief, is hoping that the third time\u2019s a charm.\u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct, based on our evidence, is harmful to consumers,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. \u201cGoogle\u2019s magnificent innovations don\u2019t give it the right to deny competitors the chance to innovate.\u201dThe stakes are high. Google could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe\u2019s tough competition rules.Google said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide a detailed response to Europe\u2019s latest charges, but it added, \u201cWe believe our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for E.U. consumers and promote competition.\u201d The company has until the fall to respond.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Europe\u2019s new antitrust charges represent a further ratcheting up of the region\u2019s often frosty relationship with Google.In particular, European antitrust officials are taking aim at some of the company\u2019s online advertising tools \u2014 the main engine for Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue. They say that the company may have abused its dominant market position when offering some of its search products on third-party companies\u2019 websites.These businesses \u2014 including publishers and online retailers \u2014 can use Google\u2019s search engine on their sites so that people can find information like newspaper articles or promotions. Such agreements with third-party companies, which date to 2006, also include showing paid-for advertising next to search results, often provided by Google.Ms. Vestager said on Thursday that the technology company may have abused its dominance \u2014 it holds roughly an 80 percent market share in this type of niche on-site search \u2014 by forcing companies to sign onerous contracts that limited competition and reduced consumer choice.Since 2009, Google has made it easier for advertising rivals to show their offerings alongside its services. But Europe\u2019s competition chief said that Google still required third-party companies to show a minimum number of Google-provided ads on their site. The Silicon Valley company also requires businesses using the service to ask for approval on where some rivals\u2019 ads may be shown on their websites.\u201cAll these restrictions allowed Google to protect its market share and stifle competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Europe\u2019s antitrust authorities have also doubled down on a previous competition charge, announced last year, which claimed that Google had diverted traffic from competitors in favor of its own comparison-shopping site. On Thursday, Ms. Vestager said her team had found new evidence to buttress their claims, adding that because of Google\u2019s actions, European consumers may not have access to the most relevant search results when looking online for goods and services.Yet when asked about the failure of European antitrust authorities to order fines or changes to the way Google does business, despite several years of investigations, Ms. Vestager said she aimed to ensure the charges against the company stood up in European courts.\u201cSpeed is of the essence,\u201d but \u201cthe other side of that coin is quality,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Thursday. \u201cSometimes that kind of quality comes at the cost of speed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementJuly 20, 2016Jeffrey LewisKori SchakeU.S. nuclear weapons stationed in Turkey are under the control of U.S. military forces, so they would be defended by ferociously well-trained and well-equipped American troops. Maintaining control of the weapons would be the top priority if seizure was ever threatened, with all of America\u2019s military power put to the task.  Moreover, American nuclear forces cannot be used without codes, making the weapons impossible to set off without authorization.  So the fact that nuclear weapons are stationed in Turkey does not make them vulnerable to capture and use, even if the country were to turn hostile to the United States.Only U.S. nuclear forces are shared within the alliance, and they remain under U.S. control but are matched with allied air crews from Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey.  Weapons are stationed in those countries to maximize the demonstration of alliance solidarity.   If the weapons are in the U.S. and we have to choose to send them, enemies might think they could give us second thoughts (like Obama had about the Syria red line).  That's destabilizing.  Even the perception that the United States would not honor its NATO pledge would dangerously erode Europe\u2019s security.The most effective nonproliferation policy has actually been security guarantees by the United States to its allies.  Several countries \u2014 including Germany, Japan and South Korea \u2014 have the ability to build nuclear weapons but have chosen not to because they trust in our commitment to defend them.  If the U.S. were to withdraw weapons from Turkey, it would be a further signal to already worried allies that the United States can no longer be relied on as a security partner.  And that could easily lead countries like Turkey to develop nuclear weapons of their own.Should the United States remove the nuclear  bombs stored at Incirlik air base in Turkey?  Well, the Turkish commander of the base just used the assets under his command to help the coup plotters mount an F-16 strike on the parliament.  What do you think?Yes, the bombs are stored in vaults, inside protective aircraft shelters, inside a security perimeter and require special codes to arm them.  But none of these features are intended to protect the weapons against a host nation that attempts to seize them.  They can buy time, but that is all.These weapons serve no purpose. Neither Turkish aircraft nor U.S. aircraft in Turkey  can deliver the bombs.  The United States Air Force regards them as an expensive distraction from the mission of countering the Islamic State.  The Turkish government regards them as a political liability that shouldn\u2019t be mentioned.Why do they stay?  We are told the weapons are an important symbol of our commitment to NATO.  What the bombs at Incirlik really symbolize, however, is our inability to relinquish our nuclear stockpiles, even once they have no purpose and are an evident security threat.It isn't just Turkey that is a problem.  Peace activists have repeatedly breached the security at an airbase where U.S. nuclear weapons are stored in Belgium.  Belgium, of course, was also the victim of a series of horrific terrorist attacks. A recent Air Force review found that security at all the foreign airbases that host U.S. nuclear weapons was inadequate.People who oppose sending the weapons back to the United States argue that we should not reduce the remaining 200 or so American nuclear weapons in Europe until Russia reduces its stockpile of several thousand tactical nuclear weapons.  But the weapons in Turkey or other locations don\u2019t have to return to the United States.  They could be consolidated elsewhere in Europe, at U.S.-operated airbases in politically stable countries such as Germany, Italy or the United Kingdom.Of course that would require the U.S. explain to the German, Italian and the British publics why they should offer asylum, so to speak, to nuclear weapons fleeing Turkey.  And if you think the sight of the Turkish commander of a NATO nuclear base being arrested for treason worries some people in NATO\u2019s nuclear bureaucracy, it is nothing compared to the terror of defending this posture in public.It is not true that NATO nuclear weapons in Turkey serve no purpose.  They serve political, military and economic purposes.  Wars start when combatants think they can achieve political objectives by force \u2014 that is, when they think they can win.  Nuclear weapons make wars between countries that have them unwinnable.  So nuclear weapons  stabilize relations between the strongest powers.  Shared responsibility for nuclear weapons missions in NATO demonstrates to Russia and other adversaries the solidarity of the NATO allies, our willingness to fight to preserve the independence of our countries.  Removing those weapons from Europe might reasonably cause adversaries to think the United States could be divided from Europe in a crisis, or wouldn\u2019t come to Europe\u2019s defense.  Those kinds of calculations make Europe less secure and war more likely.Nuclear weapons reduce the conventional forces necessary to deter adversaries.  Much larger armies would be necessary if we and our European allies wanted to make it impossible for an enemy to believe they could win a war against us. Since the mission of NATO militaries is defensive, war would be fought on the country of our allies, at enormous human cost.  Both for reasons of reassurance and the cost of regaining Europe if it were overrun, the United States would need to station much larger forces in Europe to prevail in a conventional-only war.It is also not true that European governments are unwilling to persuade their publics of the value of nuclear weapons.  Just yesterday the British Parliament voted to continue with their nuclear submarine programs; the majority of opposition MPs even voted in favor after an extensive public debate.  Two weeks ago Germany and Belgium also reaffirmed the role of nuclear weapons in NATO defenses.  If we did not consider it a provocation to Russia, other allies would be willing to participate in nuclear stationing and nuclear missions.That the U.S. Air Force considers nuclear missions an expensive distraction is true.  But it says more about the fighter pilot culture of the Air Force as an institution than it does about the nuclear mission.  Pilots prefer the operational challenge of non-nuclear missions; that does not mean they are more valuable than the strategic mission of nuclear weapons strikes.  The military also does not like fighting in cyber-degraded environments or using chemical weapons protection gear, but unless they do, our enemies have enormous advantages.  And yes, peace activists breached defenses.  That our military treats civilian protests without recourse to deadly force is to their great credit; that in no way demonstrates they are incapable of carrying out their missions against enemies.War between major powers has been so long deterred by nuclear weapons that we in the West have grown inured to the risk of war against a country that could conceivably destroy our cities, take our political sovereignty, or impose tens of thousands of military casualties on our forces.  We have the luxury of fighting enemies incapable of those things because nuclear weapons have stabilized higher-end threats.  But just because nuclear weapons have become unfashionable in the West does not mean that our adversaries consider them so.  \nIf NATO nuclear weapons in Turkey are important, why are there no aircraft there to drop them? If European governments support the NATO nuclear mission, why don\u2019t they provide for adequate security at the bases?  And most important, why isn\u2019t Germany jumping at the chance to house the nuclear weapons currently in Turkey?I agree that it is important that NATO deter Russia. That\u2019s why I am willing to try consolidating existing U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe instead of withdrawing them. Russia has invaded two of its neighbors and seems committed to destabilizing others \u2013 including NATO members in the Baltics.  Russia is also in flagrant violation of an important arms control treaty, the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Agreement.But how can NATO best respond to Russia\u2019s belligerence?  The most important goal is that we remain united as allies. For my entire lifetime, Moscow has sought a Germany that is neutral and isolated from NATO.  That\u2019s why Putin keeps inviting former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to his birthday parties.While NATO communiques talk loudly about the importance of nuclear weapons, the actions of NATO members reveal a deep ambivalence: Nuclear weapons are an issue that divides, not unites, us. That is why officials worry that Germany wouldn\u2019t accept the nuclear weapons now stored in Turkey. And that is why almost no one \u2013 on the right or the left -- proposes the United States respond to Russia\u2019s violation of the INF Treaty by withdrawing from the agreement and attempting to station our own nuclear-armed missiles in Europe.  We say nuclear weapons are important, but our actions say otherwise.If our main goal was improving security, we could consolidate the existing number of nuclear weapons in a smaller number of air bases in Europe.  But if the argument is that moving the weapons would be too politically explosive or divisive, then doesn\u2019t that tell us something about the value of the weapons? Doesn't that tell us that the weapons symbolize a divided alliance?We should try to consolidate the weapons, but if other NATO states won\u2019t take them, bring them home. In the long-run, NATO is better off reducing its emphasis on nuclear weapons in favor of a strong conventional deterrent against Russian aggression. It is Russia that needs nuclear weapons to offset its fundamental weakness.  NATO would be stronger if its members stopped criticizing those who support working toward disarmament and started criticizing Russia, which is currently developing a bizarre array of new nuclear arms out of cold war science fiction.  NATO should reject the madness of the Cold War, not cling to its relics.Should the United States pull its weapons from Turkey, and other NATO bases, to more secure locations?"}

Desperate, by the time he was 19, they dragged him to a psychiatrist, who prescribed an antipsychotic drug, a tranquilizer and an antidepressant.\u201cThere were the beginnings of a psychosis,\u201d the doctor, Hamouda Chemceddine, recalled in an interview in the Tunisian city of Sousse, looking over his notes from that visit in August 2004. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t someone who was living in the real world.\u201dIn France, he even created a Facebook page with an alter ego, listing his profession as a \u201cprofessor of salsa dancing\u201d and displaying a mock image of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, in drag.Since then, all of France has struggled to explain the single most murderous act yet committed by an individual since the country\u2019s wave of terror began. Was Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s rampage terrorism or merely the outburst of a madman? Or both?Instead, it showed plenty of signs of verging psychosis and a hair-trigger propensity for violence by a man variously described as a drinker, a wife beater, a drug taker and a chronic womanizer.\u201cHe danced, he smoked, he ate pork. It was almost as though he wasn\u2019t even Muslim,\u201d Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s brother Jaber, 19, said in an interview outside the family home here in Msaken, Tunisia. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even pray.\u201dRather, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s life appears to show the ways in which the unstable and aggrieved have latched on to Islamic State propaganda to shape their violent fixations and find permission to act them out.In turn, the Islamic State has latched on to them, declaring as its foot soldiers even individuals with tenuous ties to the group but long histories of personal and psychological troubles who are far from models of Islamic rectitude.One was Tunisian, two had dual French and Tunisian citizenship, and two were from Albania. All were charged with, among other things, terrorist conspiracy on accusations that they egged on Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel and helped him get a gun and rent the truck he used.But none, including Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, appeared linked to the Islamic State in a meaningful way, Mr. Molins said, despite apparently following its exhortations to kill the enemy, including to \u201crun him over with your car.\u201dMr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s violent outburst was not that surprising to people in his old neighborhood in Msaken, a bustling suburb of Sousse with a tennis club and a picturesque mosque. He was raised here as one of three sons and six daughters born to a hardworking and fairly prosperous farmer and property owner.Instead, the neighbors felt shame, and many were resisting having him buried here, a local official said. No one mentioned his having the slightest allegiance to extremist Islam.But many had stories of abuse by him, and knew to avoid crossing the bulky young man who skipped classes, worked out obsessively, bulked up on protein and flew into a rage at the drop of a hat.\u201cHe would hit me when I was young,\u201d said a cousin, Zied Bouhlel, a lanky young man, wincing at the memory. \u201cHe did it as a joke, but it ended up hurting. Every time he saw me, as a joke.\u201dMany recalled an episode when Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, driving a rental car past the local bathhouse, was rear-ended by another car. Both drivers got out, and Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel proceeded to beat the daylights out of the other man.\u201cThis was totally normal for him,\u201d said Hamila Hassen, who witnessed the confrontation.Distraught, he showed a selfie his brother had sent him from Nice\u2019s Promenade des Anglais just hours before the massacre occurred there, his brother\u2019s lips twisted in a slight smile.While acknowledging that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel could become \u201cvery aggressive,\u201d Jaber nonetheless insisted that his brother could not have committed the Nice atrocity.Their father, Mondher Lahouaiej Bouhlel, refused to be interviewed. But by all accounts, relations between father and son were fraught.\u201cHe would get mad with his parents over nothing,\u201d recalled the psychiatrist, Dr. Chemceddine.A crisis was reached when Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel deliberately locked his parents out of the family home. It was then that they went to see the psychiatrist.Like many adolescents, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel appeared concerned over his physical appearance. But the young man sitting in front of him obsessed over it.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t satisfied with the image of his body,\u201d Dr. Chemceddine said. \u201c\u2018I am ugly,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve got to build myself up.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe seemed strange to me,\u201d Dr. Chemceddine added. \u201cHe had an altered perception of reality.\u201dAround 2009, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel moved to Nice, taking advantage of an arranged marriage to a cousin whose family lived there but was also originally from Msaken. The marriage was Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s ticket out of Tunisia, and he seized it.By 2009, he had his French residency papers and a 10-year carte de s\u00e9jour, or residency permit, which allowed him to work, according to a scan of the document. Soon he and his wife had a child.After he got his documents, his treatment of his wife changed drastically, for the worse, according to neighbors.\u201cHe married her to have the papers,\u201d said one, who gave her name only as Deborah and lived several floors below the couple in a 13-story building. \u201cHe showed his real face afterwards.\u201dShe said she was close to Mrs. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, and like her wore a hijab and had three children.Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel was interested only in women and drinking, she added. \u201cMy husband never saw him at the mosque.\u201dHe used the made-up identity to help him pick up women he often met salsa dancing, going to classes three times a week as well as going out for evening \u201csoirees.\u201dHe kept his salsa world completely separate from his family life, and he created a personality to go with it. In his Facebook profile, he was single, had gone to Cuba High and was from Bresilienne, a city in Haiti. He had 10 friends on the public part of his website, all of them glamorous-looking women.He went out with multiple women, some of them 20 or more years older. He never told his partners that he was married or a father.Patricia Marguerite Giliberto, 55, a regular salsa dance partner for nearly two years, pointed The New York Times to the profile under the alias. She said she had been shaken when she realized it belonged to Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, and angry at herself for having been friendly at one time with a man who is now one of France\u2019s biggest mass murderers.\u201cI knew nothing about his life,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought he was single. He always hid everything.\u201dOne thing was clear, however: The insecure young man, once obsessed by his ugliness, was now fascinated by his good looks. \u201cHe viewed himself as a stud,\u201d Ms. Giliberto said. \u201cHe was very confident about his attractiveness.\u201dWhen they corresponded on Facebook, she said, he asked her personal questions: \u201cWhere are you now? Is your skin against another person\u2019s skin\u201d \u2014 a way of asking if she was in bed with a lover.Their chats were playful and affectionate. Ms. Giliberto called him Momo, and they often agreed on where to meet for dancing.He did not have much money, and she always paid for drinks. Since she was so much older, she said, she thinks he saw her as a way to meet other, younger women.A witness said the truck \u201ccrushed everyone in its path.\u201dWhen Ms. Giliberto met the man she later married, she began to distance herself from him, and Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel became rude and angry.\u201cYou are not interesting to me, you are a problem woman,\u201d he wrote in a text. Later he told her, \u201cYou are old.\u201dShe did not hear from him again. That was just before 2013.In the years after, his domestic life deteriorated. Although his wife had two more children with him, each time hoping that would rekindle the relationship, it did not.Sometime after their first child was born, he began to hit her. Sometimes he also struck his mother-in-law, said Jean-Yves Garino, the wife\u2019s lawyer.\u201cHe was a narcissistic, perverted man, and he loved himself very much,\u201d Mr. Garino said.The neighbor Deborah said that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel sometimes drank too much, and that his wife was often afraid of him. He would intimidate and demean her, she said.She recalled a party with all of the neighbors one night, when he danced in a very seductive way with a 60-year-old woman in front of his wife.Last year or the year before \u2014 Deborah was not sure \u2014 when his wife was observing the Muslim monthlong period of fasting and abstinence during Ramadan, \u201che poured alcohol on her head to humiliate her,\u201d she said.Around the same time, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel stabbed one of his children\u2019s toys with a knife, and his wife became fearful for her children and sought a divorce, Deborah said.He moved out, and occasionally gave her some money to support the children, but not much and not often, said Mrs. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Garino.In Nice, Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel appeared on the police radar for theft and violence, most recently in January, when he got into a fight with another motorist and threw a wooden pallet at him.Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel received a six-month suspended sentence in March. By then, he may have already been fixated on carrying out violence on a grandiose scale, Mr. Molins, the Paris prosecutor, said.But it was only in the two weeks before the Nice attack that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel began to research rather mundane Islamic topics, including information about Eid al-Fitr, the celebration that ends the month of Ramadan, Mr. Molins said.Mr. Molins said Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel\u2019s photographs on his cellphone, going back nearly a year, included ones showing crowds on the Promenade des Anglais. One set of images showed the crowd during the Bastille Day fireworks a year ago, another a crowd at a concert on the promenade, also last year.Adam Nossiter reported from Msaken, and Alissa J.

{"Headline": "Why Tech Support Is (Purposely) Unbearable", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byYou may consider yourself even-keeled, the kind of person who is unflappable when those around you are losing their cool. But all that goes out the window when you call tech support. Then you fume. Your face turns red. You shout things into the phone that would appall your mother.It\u2019s called tech support rage.And you are not alone. Getting caught in a tech support loop \u2014 waiting on hold, interacting with automated systems, talking to people reading from unhelpful scripts and then finding yourself on hold yet again \u2014 is a peculiar kind of aggravation that mental health experts say can provoke rage in even the most mild-mannered person.Worse, just as you suspected, companies are aware of the torture they are putting you through.Moreover, 73 percent said the complexity of tech support calls is increasing as customers have become more technologically sophisticated and can resolve simpler issues on their own.Many organizations are running a cost-per-contact model, which limits the time agents can be on the phone with you, hence the agony of round-robin transfers and continually being placed on hold, said Justin Robbins, who was once a tech support agent himself and now oversees research and editorial at ICMI.\u201cDon\u2019t think companies haven\u2019t studied how far they can take things in providing the minimal level of service,\u201d Mr. Robbins said. \u201cSome organizations have even monetized it by intentionally engineering it so you have to wait an hour at least to speak to someone in support, and while you are on hold, you\u2019re hearing messages like, \u2018If you\u2019d like premium support, call this number and for a fee, we will get to you immediately.\u2019\u201dAT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications did not respond to requests for comment.Especially frustrating when talking to tech support is not being understood because you are trying to communicate with machines or people who have been trained to talk like machines, either for perceived quality control or because they don\u2019t speak English well enough to go off-script.When things don\u2019t make sense and feel out of control, mental health experts say, humans instinctively feel threatened. Though you would like to think you can employ reason in this situation, you\u2019re really just a mass of neural impulses and primal reactions. Think fight or flight, but you can\u2019t do either because you are stuck on the phone, which provokes rage.But tech support veterans and mental health experts said there were other ways to get better tech support or maybe just make it more bearable. First, do whatever it takes to control your temper. Take a deep breath. Count to 10. Losing your stack at a consumer support agent is not going to get your problem resolved any faster. Probably just the opposite.Don\u2019t bother demanding to speak to a supervisor, either. You\u2019re just going to get transferred to another agent who has been alerted ahead of time that you have come unhinged, Mr. Robbins said. Also, be aware that your words are being recorded and might be printed on posters in the call center.\u201cI\u2019ve seen companies make T-shirts with the cruel, awful things people say,\u201d Mr. Robbins said. He added the shirts might provide an impetus to improve because customers have been driven to such extremes, \u201cbut then it also may just show some people are truly from crazy town.\u201dCustomer support experts recommended using social media, like tweeting or sending a Facebook message, to contact a company instead of calling. You are likely to get a quicker response, not only because fewer people try that channel but also because your use of social media shows that you know how to vent your frustration to a wider audience if your needs are not met, as well as to praise them publicly when you are treated well, they said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Hockney Takes a Fresh Look at Portraiture", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byNow Mr. Hockney has set technology aside and returned, somewhat defiantly, to his original medium: painting on canvas. His new exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, through Oct. 2, is composed of 82 portraits of friends and acquaintances, almost all made in three-day sittings since 2013 at his studio in Los Angeles. The subjects include the art dealer Larry Gagosian and the architect Frank Gehry, as well as Mr. Hockney\u2019s masseur, his dentist, and his housekeeper.Executed quickly, the rainbow-hued canvases are less a study in human psychology than in body language, gesture and idiosyncrasy. Men sit with legs crossed or spread far apart; one dangles a leg over the arm of a chair. Women dress up or come as they are, appearing formal or demure. Some of the most intimate portraits are of people whom Mr. Hockney has known his whole life, such as the comedian Barry Humphries (in a fedora and spotted tie) and Mr. Hockney\u2019s sister Margaret.\u201cThis is a statement about painting,\u201d Mr. Hockney said last month in an interview among the freshly hung canvases at the exhibition, his Yorkshire accent largely unaltered by decades in California. He wore a white cap and a buttoned blue cardigan, a change from the bleached-blond fringe and sharp fashions he once sported.\u201cAn art world that says, \u2018You can\u2019t paint portraits anymore\u2019 is nonsense, really,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you mean, \u2018You can\u2019t paint portraits?\u2019 People aren\u2019t interesting to look at? Of course they are! They always will be.\u201dOne day, he saw his longtime studio assistant and friend Jean-Pierre Gon\u00e7alves de Lima with his head buried in his hands. \u201cI thought, \u2018I feel that as well \u2014 I\u2019ll just paint you,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Hockney recalled. The resulting portrait was uncannily reminiscent of Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSorrowing Old Man (At Eternity\u2019s Gate),\u201d painted in 1890.Mr. Hockney gradually painted more such portraits, placing sitters in the same yellow chair and on a raised platform, so that he could paint their shoes and not look down at them from his easel. After he started emailing images of the series to the Royal Academy curator Edith Devaney (who worked on his 2012 show), the academy asked to exhibit them.\u201cWe live in an age where we\u2019re bombarded with images of people,\u201d said Ms. Devaney, herself one of Mr. Hockney\u2019s subjects. \u201cThere is a meaningless quality to a lot of them: the endless selfies and the Facebook images.\u201dBut Mr. Hockney\u2019s portraiture, she said, is \u201csomething completely different.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s making us stop and look in a very different way,\u201d she said, adding that the paintings were meant to be viewed as a single work.Mr. Hockney said he spent a year on the painting. \u201cThe hair on Celia took a long time \u2014 those little ringlets!\u201d he said.In a telephone interview from London, Ms. Birtwell recalled how Mr. Hockney had rearranged the couple\u2019s bedroom to take advantage of the light, and how he had hidden her husband\u2019s feet in a shaggy rug because he could not paint them right.She then described her experience of posing for his recent Los Angeles series.\u201cYou sit quietly and you watch him, and his determination, and his extraordinary facial expressions,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wonder whether it\u2019s going to be O.K. or it\u2019s going to be a mess.\u201d\u201cHe says he doesn\u2019t paint portraits to enhance you in your eyes,\u201d Ms. Birtwell added. \u201cHe paints you as he sees you.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s amazingly prolific and amazingly varied,\u201d said the Tate exhibition\u2019s curator, Chris Stephens. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t really do it adequately any smaller.\u201d\u201cDavid Hockney is an incredibly popular artist, and he\u2019s known for his very affirmative, cheerful images,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. \u201cBut we want to assert the fact that underlying all of it, from the beginning till now, is a very serious interrogation of the challenges of translating the world of time and space into two dimensions.\u201dMr. Hockney said he was more involved in a \u201cvery big\u201d illustrated survey of his career to be published by Taschen this year than in the Tate show.\u201cI know the book is going to last 100 years or something, at least,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a lot of variety, because my work has a lot of variety. Not every painter has that. Some other painters might look rather boring if you\u2019re turning pages a lot.\u201dLife for Mr. Hockney in Los Angeles these days involves mostly staying at home, if only because near-deafness prevents him from going to restaurants, concerts, or the opera.\u201cI like the calm,\u201d he said. Referring to the portraits, he said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t have painted these in London.\u201dThe one vice he has clung to is smoking. \u201cI like it,\u201d Mr. Hockney said with a mischievous smile. \u201cI\u2019ve smoked for 64 years, so why give up now? I don\u2019t care if it kills me.\u201dHe is no more inclined to give up painting and his lifelong exploration of it.\u201cOne of the interesting things about David Hockney is that he\u2019s never settled for a signature style,\u201d said Martin Gayford, a British critic who published a book of conversations with Mr. Hockney in 2011 and who has co-authored another with the artist that is coming out this year. \u201cSome artists, having had the success he had with the portraits or the pools in the \u201960s, might just have carried on more or less doing that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to tell what David will do next,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

He was so happy to get that commission that he was smiling, and it lit up the stage with that smile on his face. That was the sort of man he was.\u201dIn 2007, Corporal Jackson was among the officers who suffered smoke inhalation while trying to save an infant in an apartment fire.\u201cThat man wrote his legacy,\u201d Mr. LeDuff said. \u201cHe wrote something his 4-month-old little boy will have for the rest of his life.

Like Corporal Jackson, he was assigned to its uniform patrol bureau.He was a veteran of the military who joined the Police Department in October.

He was a food service specialist who worked at bases in California and North Carolina.As a Marine, he never deployed to a combat theater. That changed in 2003, less than a year after he enlisted in the Army, when he was sent to Iraq for the first of three tours there. A repairer of Black Hawk helicopters, he held the rank of specialist and was assigned to the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Tex.Not long after the shooting started in Baton Rouge, Officer Gerald\u2019s wife posted a link on Facebook to a local television station\u2019s coverage of the episode. \u201cEveryone please pray!!!\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy husband along with others is out there.\u201dIn Officer Gerald\u2019s neighborhood just east of Baton Rouge on Monday, blue star balloons floated above several mailboxes, and a flag flew at half-staff in his yard.A neighbor, Carmen Thomas, said Officer Gerald was generous with smiles and waves when he was out with his daughters.

Waving his hand at her, he said, \u201cTell me, what are they going to do when they hear the news, ah, tell me?\u201dBy banning the broadcasting of information, the government doesn\u2019t just stifle debate and news; it also represses the nation\u2019s emotions. Keep calm, we are urged. Don\u2019t feel panic, don\u2019t question anything.In the city center the morning after the attacks, it was awkwardly silent. Only the really passionate tourists were trotting around, finding the best shot to Instagram. I had to venture out to pay my taxes. I ended up having a strange conversation with the tax officer. It was as if we were both dubbed: Our faces were expressing the horrors of the night before; our voices were talking about dates and money due.Walking around, I heard snippets of small talk between strangers \u2014 breaking what was mostly silence \u2014 as if they were sound bites from a broken record, having almost no line of logic.\u201cI cannot take it anymore.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk yet,\u201d referring to our president. \u201cNothing will happen.\u201d \u201cMaybe I lost it completely.\u201d \u201cIs Facebook on yet?\u201d \u201cDid you see that \u2018Survivor\u2019 was first in ratings last night?\u201dMeanwhile, the airport was washed clean of the human blood and flesh. By early morning Wednesday, the state media was heralding that the airport was operating already.This cheerful comment is one example among many showing how we are being pushed to indifference by those in power. The turn toward this indifference has been building over the past few years. Some troubling moments stand out.This is how you lose it. This is also how you learn to pretend life can just go on as it was. Any belief to the contrary requires standing up to a mob of cruelty \u2014 a mob that has the weight of the government behind it.Thirty hours after the attack, I was scheduled to fly from Ataturk Airport to Berlin. Of course, my flight was not canceled. On the road to the airport, I made up my mind to express my condolences to members of the airport staff. But once I walked in the terminal, the mood was completely normal, too normal, so I did not bother.Instead I look around to check if the young security officer, the one who smiles at me when we run into each other, is alive. He is, good. The young woman at the counter at duty free? She is alive as well. Finally, the guy I always tease for selling the most expensive coffee on the planet, he is still there, too. Though who knows if there are injuries I cannot see. Everyone is silent. Pain can choke you when it isn\u2019t shared.Her tweets made me ask: In a society where crowds boo a dead child, or simply dismiss death and go on as usual after the unimaginable, what can happen next?I didn\u2019t want to dwell on this idea. I turned to the window, where I saw the rain pouring down, quite unusual this time of year. Then the sad announcement started: \u201cThe memorial service for those we lost in the bomb attack will take place today at \u2026\u201dThe airport fell silent for only a few seconds. Everybody looked down or away, anything to avoid exchanging looks with a fellow passenger.

{"Headline": "Republican Convention: Floor Fighting on Day 1", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byThe convention floor momentarily turned into a scene of discord and boisterous dissent on Monday. Those who were opposing Donald J. Trump broke into booming jeers and chants of \u201cRoll call vote! Roll call vote!\u201d in an attempt to demand a vote by all 2,472 delegates on a procedural motion that is required before the convention can formally get underway.Their hope was that by starting a lengthy process so late in the day \u2014 just a few hours before the convention\u2019s prime-time programming was set to begin \u2014 they could embarrass Mr. Trump by delaying the convention\u2019s opening speakers.Delegates who opposed them appeared to have the advantage. And they responded with their own noisy shouts of \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201dBut after several minutes of confusion, and a couple of musical interludes by the band to kill time, the anti-Trump delegates appeared to have been stymied.When the chairman called for a voice vote on whether to have a roll call vote, he ruled that the \u201cno\u201d votes prevailed.Initially, there appeared to be at least nine states in which a majority of delegates agreed to the roll call vote, meeting the threshold of seven required under party rules. But faced with the possibility of a runaway start to the convention, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee staff members working the floor went into overdrive to get delegates to withdraw their support.Stamping the rebellion out was a show of organizational muscle and discipline by the Trump campaign and the party, which had teams of aides scurrying around the arena as they tried to flip votes. They wore ear pieces and carried stacks of affidavits that they circulated to delegates as they pressured them to withdraw their support for the roll call vote.In the end, they peeled away enough votes so that only six states had a majority of their delegates on the petition. And the crowd broke into chants of \u201cwe want Trump!\u201dLeaders of the rebellion conceded defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d said Ken Cuccinelli, a delegate from Virginia who was coordinating the effort. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to appeal.\u201dDelegates said the forces working to stop the vote were intense. \u201cThey just steamrolled it,\u201d said Rachel Hoff, a delegate from the District of Columbia, which was one of the delegations that initially supported the roll call vote but backed off. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re denying the delegates the agency to play a role in the process,\u201d added Ms. Hoff, who did not sign one of the affidavits.After the scene in the arena settled down, the Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, insisted he was never concerned he was going to lose control of the convention.\u201cFrom our standpoint, it wasn\u2019t relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was handily defeated. And now we move on.\u201dThe floor skirmish was further evidence that the party still had a long way to go toward unity.John Weaver, a strategist for Mr. Kasich, mocked Mr. Manafort and accused him of being \u201con the lam\u201d with thugs and autocrats.Party unity, it seems, will still take some time.Mr. Trump says women love him. Public surveys say otherwise.And if part of the convention\u2019s purpose is to package Mr. Trump as a more acceptable choice to this skeptical swath of the electorate, Monday\u2019s testimonials could go a long way.Among those invited onstage, organizers say, are the relatives of people killed by immigrants who entered the country illegally. There will also be a discussion of the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attack, which will surely double as a rolling broadside against Hillary Clinton.And in a nod to the Northeastern bravado at the top of the Republican ticket this year, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York will lend his voice. Look for Mr. Giuliani, who recently prompted an uproar after calling the Black Lives Matter movement \u201cinherently racist,\u201d to weigh in on the most recent violence against police officers.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Attacks on Muslims, Many Ask: Where Is the Outpouring?", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported by\u201cAll this crazy violence has a goal,\u201d Mr. Kilo, who is Christian, said: to create a backlash against Muslims, divide societies and \u201cmake Sunnis feel that no matter what happens, they don\u2019t have any other option.\u201dOne of the primary goals of the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups is to drive a wedge between Sunni Muslims and the wider world, to fuel alienation as a recruiting tool. And when that world appears to show less empathy for the victims of attacks in Muslim nations, who have borne the brunt of the Islamic State\u2019s massacres and predatory rule, it seems to prove their point.The violence feeds a growing impulse among many in the West to fear Muslims and Arabs, which has already prompted a political crisis over immigration that, in turn, has buttressed extremists\u2019 goals. Europe is convulsing over a movement to reject refugees from Syria and Iraq, who are themselves fleeing violence by jihadists and their own governments.It is in Syria and Iraq that the Islamic State has established its so-called caliphate, ruling overwhelmingly Muslim populations with the threat of gruesome violence. The group has killed Muslims in those countries by the thousands, by far the largest share of its victims.But over the past week, Facebook activated its Safety Check feature, which allows people in the vicinity of a disaster to mark themselves safe, only after the attack on the Istanbul airport.The flags of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Bangladesh have not been widely projected on landmarks or adopted as profile pictures. (Photographs on social media showed that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of Europe\u2019s two majority-Muslim countries, the Turkish flag was beamed onto a bridge in Mostar, the scene of sectarian killings in the 1990s.) Some wonder if part of the reason is that three of those flags bear Islamic symbols or slogans.There are some understandable reasons for the differing reactions. People typically identify more closely with places and cultures that are familiar to them. With Iraq, there is also a degree of fatigue, and a feeling that a bombing there is less surprising than one in Europe.Deadly attacks have been a constant in Iraq after years of American occupation, followed by a sectarian war in which Sunni and Shiite militias slaughtered civilians of the opposite sect. Still, while terrorist attacks in Europe may feel more surprising to the West \u2014 though they have become all too common there, too \u2014 that does not explain the relative indifference to attacks in Istanbul, Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh.In the Muslim world, the partly sectarian nature of some conflicts shades people\u2019s reactions, producing a kind of internal sympathy gap. People from one sect or political group often discount or excuse casualties from another.In Iraq, the Islamic State took root within an insurgency against the country\u2019s Shiite-led government, and Shiite militias fighting it have been accused of brutality as well. In Syria, it is just one menace; many more Syrians have been killed by the government\u2019s attacks on areas held by Sunni insurgents, including rebel groups opposed to the Islamic State.Mr. Jiyad added that the Islamic State was \u201choping to incite a reaction and a spiral into endless violence,\u201d and that Iraqis played into that when they mourned more for their own sect than for others.In the West, though, there is a tendency in certain quarters, legitimized by some politicians, to conflate extremist Islamist militants with the Muslim societies that are often their primary victims, or to dismiss Muslim countries as inherently violent.When she asked where I lived, and I told her Beirut, Lebanon, she exclaimed about the violence in the region. Struggling to explain that there is a lot more than just violence happening there, I said: \u201cYes, there are a lot of problems. What can one do?\u201d\u201cExterminer les islamistes,\u201d she said grimly. Exterminate: a strong word. Islamists: a broad category of people.Mr. Kilo, who spent years in the prisons of the Syrian government and opposes both it and the Islamic State, said his life in Paris had changed since November. Speaking Arabic is now suspect.

{"Headline": "Labour Party in Britain Faces Its Worst Crisis in Decades", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Paul Flynn, an independent-minded left-winger, has served as a member of Parliament for nearly three decades, but until recently he had not held a leadership job in the Labour Party since the late 1980s. Staying on the backbenches was not just his choice, he said, but also \u201cthe choice of the past five leaders.\u201dIt is a sign of the disarray in the opposition Labour Party that Mr. Flynn, 81, found himself given not just one senior position a few weeks ago, but two. With most of the party\u2019s lawmakers seeking to unseat their polarizing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, there is such a shortage of members of Parliament willing to serve under him that he has been having trouble simply keeping his team filled out.More than at any time since the height of the Thatcher era in the 1980s, Labour is divided, demoralized and searching for an identity. Responsible for some of Britain\u2019s biggest postwar social advances, including the creation of a free health care system, Labour won elections in the 1960s and 1970s and then held power for 13 years up to 2010. But since then, it has seen its representation in Parliament dwindle and is now embroiled in a fierce struggle between centrists and those who want to drive the party in a more ideological direction.Mr. Corbyn, an unyielding leftist who came to power on an anti-austerity platform, has won the loyalty of grass-roots party activists much as Senator Bernie Sanders did during the Democratic presidential primaries in the United States. Critics say that, like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Corbyn and his supporters often seem more comfortable fighting losing battles over principle than in compromising in the service of incremental progress. Many elected Labour legislators view Mr. Corbyn as unelectable in a general election, leading to a bitter leadership challenge that has all but paralyzed the party and sparked speculation that it could split.The party\u2019s problems are all the more striking given that it was the governing Conservatives who set off the current upheaval in British politics by calling for a referendum on the nation\u2019s membership in the European Union. The vote to leave cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job, set off a spectacle of a fight to replace him and left the Conservatives to carry out the split from Europe amid signs of economic weakening.But while the Conservatives have rallied around their new leader, Prime Minister Theresa May, Labour\u2019s divisions have only grown more pronounced. And the attendant drama \u2014 including mass resignations from Mr. Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet, a no-confidence vote in which four-fifths of his lawmakers voted against him and now a leadership challenge \u2014 suggests that there will be no quick or easy resolution.Indeed, Mr. Corbyn is hanging on, confident that the grass-roots party members and supporters who elected him as leader overwhelmingly last year will brush aside the objections of Labour legislators and back him again in a vote scheduled for September.Eric Shaw, a historian and author of several books on the Labour Party, described its predicament as \u201cextraordinarily serious,\u201d and likened the crisis to that of 1931, the year of a crushing and historic election defeat.If Mr. Corbyn survives, the leadership will remain at war with most of Labour\u2019s lawmakers, and the electoral consequences could be \u201cquite devastating,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.In the background lurk serious, perhaps existential, problems for Labour. In last year\u2019s general election, the party lost all but one of its seats in Scotland \u2014 once a heartland \u2014 and it has hemorrhaged support in some traditional strongholds in northern England to the populist U.K. Independence Party.\u201cThere is a crucial sociological change that has happened with the decline in class consciousness, cohesion and identity,\u201d Mr. Shaw said, adding that people no longer tend to think \u201c \u2018we are all working class here, we will all vote Labour.\u2019 \u201dAt the same time, Mr. Shaw said, unions are no longer playing as vital a role in keeping Labour from swinging too far to the right or to the left.But the catalyst for the latest combustion was the referendum in June on Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. Mr. Corbyn was blamed by critics for Labour\u2019s lackluster campaign to stay in the European Union, and many of his lawmakers fret that, with him in charge, Labour would be trounced if Mrs. May were to call for an early general election.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics accuse him of poor leadership, pedestrian performances in Parliament, a failure to reach out beyond committed left-wingers, and being more concerned with controlling the Labour Party than winning power.His supporters view Mr. Corbyn as a man of principle and integrity, untainted by the compromises and mistakes of the governments led by Tony Blair.The divisions make effective parliamentary opposition almost impossible. In a recent debate on Britain\u2019s nuclear weapons program, Mr. Corbyn argued against renewing it, but was defied by 140 of 230 Labour lawmakers.Mr. Corbyn has been accused of incompetence or worse. Richard Murphy, who had advised the Labour leader on economic policy, wrote that within his team there \u201cwas no policy direction, no messaging, no direction, no coordination, no nothing.\u201dIn a Facebook post, one Labour lawmaker, Thangam Debbonaire, said she was appointed to Mr. Corbyn\u2019s parliamentary team \u201cwithout my knowledge or consent whilst I was in the middle of cancer treatment.\u201d\u201cHe then sacked me the next day when he realized he had given away part of someone else\u2019s role. But didn\u2019t bother to tell me that either,\u201d she added. Mr. Corbyn\u2019s aides acknowledged that there was miscommunication over the appointment but said Ms. Debbonaire had not been dismissed.Ms. Eagle told the BBC she had been getting \u201chuge amounts of bullying, threats and nasty messages,\u201d that she had unplugged the phone in her office because of the volume of abusive calls, and that the police were investigating a death threat.Anti-Corbyn Labour lawmakers complain of being targeted by a grass-roots group, supportive of Mr. Corbyn, called Momentum. Party meetings have been suspended until September.But James Schneider, national organizer of Momentum, told the BBC that lawmakers had failed to understand the extent to which Labour, after two election defeats, needed to transform into a party that uses \u201cmass membership and that organizes in communities.\u201dMr. Corbyn\u2019s opponent in the leadership fight is Owen Smith, 46, who was elected to Parliament in 2010.Mr. Smith played a low-key role in Labour politics until recently, but outflanked Ms. Eagle with strong media performances, and by pitching his campaign to the left. As he was not in Parliament at the time, he did not vote in favor of the Iraq war \u2014 a touchstone issue for Labour members \u2014 as she did.But Mr. Smith\u2019s record before entering Parliament is now being picked over by Mr. Corbyn\u2019s supporters, particularly his role working for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, prompting critics to claim that he favored greater private-sector involvement in Britain\u2019s National Health Service \u2014 an institution revered in particular by Labour supporters.Despite the dark times for Labour, Mr. Flynn, now juggling two jobs for Mr. Corbyn\u2019s parliamentary team, is keeping his sense of humor. Beyond speaking for the party on parliamentary procedural issues and those affecting Wales, he has joked about setting up \u201call octogenarian shortlists\u2019\u2019 for Labour Party candidates and likened top jobs in the parliamentary party to London buses.\u201cYou wait 26 years for one, then two come along together,\u201d he said.Follow Stephen Castle on Twitter @_StephenCastleAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Puerto Rico was in the midst of a mass exodus last year when Erika P. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez returned to the island. Settling in after a few years of college and work in California, she was asked more than once, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy the hell are you coming back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes I question myself too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez, 27, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDealing with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening is tough.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs a photographer, Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez has been looking in recent years at issues of national identity as her homeland grapples with a crippling debt crisis and major social upheaval. Puerto Rico has been under American jurisdiction since the Spanish-American War, and its official status as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree associated state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or commonwealth of the United States, had been accepted by a majority of Puerto Ricans as a compromise between statehood and independence that allowed the duality of American citizenship with a Latin American sense of self. But last month, Congress voted on, and President Obama signed, legislation that imposed a federal control board on the Caribbean territory, hoping to rein in the economic free fall through fiscal belt-tightening and overseeing payments to creditors.The strict oversight underscores the limits of Puerto Rico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political status \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its residents are not autonomous and as United States citizens cannot vote for president and have only a nonvoting congressional representative. The approval of the control board has brought with it a moment of collective reckoning among the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated 3.5 million residents. But for Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez, it presented a challenge on how best to portray it.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe crisis is always represented in numbers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how much it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owed, how many people are leaving,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really personal. How are people taking this? We talk about the crisis. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re suffering it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having the conversation about how people are experiencing the crisis enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez explores identity in one of the world\u2019s oldest colonies through intimate pictures that look at subtleties \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat speak to who we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In one, a young woman dressed in the African garb common to practitioners of Santer\u00c3\u00ada dances at a hip-hop concert, surrounded by admirers and cellphone cameras. In another, Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez captures several of her relatives at a family gathering, but the telling details are a bunch of plantains and an empty chair (below).The \u00e2\u0080\u009cmancha de pl\u00c3\u00a1tano,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cplantain stain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a Puerto Rican stamp of sorts in the island\u2019s folklore. The empty chair is a recurring image in Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez pictures, reflecting the disturbing departure of thousands of Puerto Ricans to the mainland looking for jobs.All of it is deeply personal, said Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez, who has been saying goodbye to many of her friends and even to one of her two sisters. In one picture, a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10-year-old curls up atop the clothes of an open bag as the family packs to move to Michigan.No one says when \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or if \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they will ever come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m part of the story, and my entire environment is the story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Aside from the emotional burden, Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said she had struggled with how to represent the debt crisis visually without falling on clich\u00c3\u00a9s, like abandoned buildings. In one portrait, she photographed a schoolteacher whose somber demeanor clashes with her cheerful classroom. She holds two jobs, the photographer said, yet faces the prospect of retirement without a pension because \u00e2\u0080\u009cright now they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have retirement money for all the teachers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said that as Puerto Ricans go about their business, many don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to talk about the dire situation. Others say they believe that the federal fiscal board will take care of the corrupt politicians who caused the problems in the first place and get their house in order. But that, she argues, is the mentality of a colonized people.Last month, she was watching the congressional discussions on C-Span when the fiscal control board, known by its acronym as Promesa, or promise, was approved in a flurry of yeas. Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said she became so anxious as the votes were being cast that she had to call a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what hurts the most \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all the cuts that are coming or that we are spectators of our history without being able to do anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, a catch in her voice as she fought tears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have no voice. That hurts a lot.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pictures do not depict hopelessness. She recently trained her camera on a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newborn, clad in a diaper that read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBorn at Home\u201d (Slide15).The baby was born the day after Promesa was signed into law, Ms. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said, and the image itself holds a promise \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat life keeps going and that it is up to us to decide our future and build the Puerto Rico we want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}
{"Headline": "The Olympics Issue", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "July 31, 2016By Michael PowellOne man blocked his path: Usain Bolt, from Sherwood Content, Jamaica \u2014 the charismatic star who dominated sprinting after Gatlin was banished from the sport in 2006. Bolt won gold medals in both the 100 and 200 meters at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. \u201cI had a target all season long, and it was Bolt in Beijing,\u201d Gatlin told me recently. \u201cI knew I needed to run 9.7 to beat him.\u201d He seemed ready to do so: He was conquering 2015 so far, having run 100 meters in 9.74 seconds in Qatar in May, followed by a 9.75 in Rome in June and another in Lausanne in July. His times were less than two-tenths of a second off Bolt\u2019s world record.The gun sounded. Gatlin\u2019s head-down drive was instantaneous. Forty yards out, his acceleration mechanically perfect, he was a step ahead. But the beauty of Bolt is to be found not in his starts but in his top-end speed and his ferocious competitiveness. With racehorselike strides, he pulled even. World-class sprints are blink-of-eye affairs, yet the best runners talk as if these races occur in slow motion; they notice everything. Gatlin saw Bolt at the edge of his vision. With 20 meters to go, he started to come undone. His chest flew out; his stride grew long and wild. \u201cI ran like I was out there on the streets,\u201d Gatlin recounted to me with disgust. \u201cInstead of concentrating on my technique and my race, I got sucked into all the hype.\u201dBoth men lunged for the line. Gatlin crossed at 9.8 seconds. As he had predicted, that was not enough. Bolt got there four inches ahead of him, in 9.79 seconds.In the BBC television booth, in seats set aside for track insiders and former champions, ecstatic cheering broke out for Bolt, a man the British press had celebrated as a savior and \u201csuperhero.\u201d Sebastian Coe, twice an Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters and now the president of track\u2019s ruling body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, had opined to BBC One that track \u201cneeds Usain to come through in Beijing.\u201dWhen a television reporter caught up with Gatlin after the race, he said, \u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d \u2014 his voice caught \u2014 \u201chappy to be an American.\u201d He tried again, speaking of those who loved him. \u201cIt keeps me emotional inside. I\u2019m just happy to be here, man.\u201d Gatlin tried to say more but could not.The pressure to seek chemical advantages in a sport where the margins of victory are so small cannot be overstated. Gatlin finished first at the United States Olympic trials earlier this month. Michael Rodgers finished two-tenths of a second behind him, in fourth place, and did not qualify for the Olympics in that event.Sprinters\u2019 prospects can hinge on balky hamstrings and pulled calf muscles. They take piles of vitamins and supplements, visit doctors in hopes of finding and keeping an edge. An industry has popped up to certify which supplements are clean of banned substances. A no-less-vigorous underground industry of pharmacists and endocrinologists boasts to athletes and coaches of being able to increase muscle mass and endurance and speed the healing of injuries while evading ever more sophisticated tests. Anonymous surveys suggest that significantly more athletes dope, often in microdoses, than are caught. \u201cWe can\u2019t be na\u00efve: There\u2019s a win-at-any-cost in every sport,\u201d says Travis T. Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Too many coaches, he adds, ask runners to sign public pledges not to use drugs and then, in private, press them to do just that.Ross Tucker, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of the Free State in South Africa whose website, The Science of Sport, is much respected in the world of running, points out that \u201cvery few people in history have sprinted under 9.9 seconds without testing positive for a drug at some point.\u201d Bolt, 29, is in that group, but Gatlin is not. Now he is about to become the oldest sprinter in United States Olympic history while also representing the nation\u2019s best shot at beating Bolt and winning gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters. Gatlin is one of a tiny handful of men in their mid-30s who have run 100 meters in under 10 seconds, and his times have improved in five of the past seven years. \u201cHe\u2019s running faster than when he won the 2004 gold medal,\u201d Tucker says. \u201cThat makes him an extreme outlier in a sport known for doping.\u201dHe is tested often and randomly by the United States Anti-Doping Agency; screeners have checked his blood four times and his urine 10 times this year. They look for evidence of steroids, stimulants, blood doping and human growth hormone. The more Gatlin wins, the more he is tested. He consistently passes these tests. Yet he cannot outpace suspicion \u2014 either that he might still be doping or that he continues to derive benefits from past steroid use, a phenomenon scientists have seen in experiments on mice. Studies suggest that the muscle mass acquired through steroid use could remain for many months, perhaps years, after that use ends.Running was like breathing. He raced along oak-shaded streets, while his friends rode bicycles beside him. In high school, he was a coach\u2019s dream, running hurdles on a team that won a state championship. His mother laid down the rules for the college recruiters who took turns visiting their home: He had to remain within a day\u2019s drive from Pensacola. He went to the University of Tennessee, where, as a freshman in 2001, he won N.C.A.A. titles in the 100 and 200 meters. \u201cIn high school, you get to leave school early and see girls in short shorts,\u201d he says. \u201cIn college, everything was an intense blur.\u201dAt the end of his freshman year, Gatlin tested positive for a minute trace of amphetamine after running as an amateur in an event sponsored by USA Track & Field. Amphetamines are ingredients in Adderall, which Gatlin had a prescription for and had taken while preparing for midterms in two summer courses. That accorded with N.C.A.A. rules and was consistent with the guidance offered to professional athletes. Gatlin figured the drug would exit his body by the time he raced three days later.This would become a foundation stone in the narrative of Gatlin as unrepentant cheat. Except that there was nothing to repent for: An American Arbitration Association panel concluded that Gatlin took a permitted medication in the appropriate dosage, and that it did not aid his performance. \u201cHe neither cheated nor intended to cheat,\u201d the panel stated. \u201cHe is certainly not a doper.\u201d His transgression consisted of not having told officials in advance that he had taken Adderall. The international body that governs professional track cut what was initially a two-year suspension to a single year. Because Gatlin remained in school, competing as an amateur, the suspension had no practical effect on him.Gatlin left college after his sophomore year, having won six N.C.A.A. titles, in order to turn pro. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s take a plane, bring it on,\u2019 \u201d Gatlin says. \u201cI want to make a name for myself.\u201d His first professional race pitted him against his idol, Maurice Greene. Gatlin was vibrating with nerves, but he finished ahead of Greene.Just before he turned pro, Gatlin and his parents, Willie and Jeanette, drove from Pensacola to New York for a funeral. (They could not afford the airfare.) On the drive, Gatlin\u2019s cellphone rang. It was Trevor Graham, who wanted to be his coach. \u201cI told him I\u2019d never heard of him \u2014 Trevor was kind of taken aback,\u201d Gatlin recalls. He got a crash course in finances. Graham had a formidable reputation and coached a stable of athletes affiliated with Nike, a colossus in the track world and a company Graham served as a frontman. According to Jeanette Gatlin\u2019s testimony in a later hearing, Graham told her son that Nike wanted to cut a deal with him years earlier but feared bad publicity if it persuaded him to skip college.Graham promised to treat Gatlin like a son, though his parents never stopped feeling uneasy about the rumors of doping that swirled around the world of pro track. (In 2004, Willie saw something online saying that his son had failed a drug test. He would learn it was an April Fool\u2019s gag \u2014 but not before Jeanette found him packing his pistol. He told her: \u201cI\u2019m driving to North Carolina to kill Trevor. He promised this would not happen.\u201d)Graham guided Gatlin to his greatest moment as a sprinter when he won gold, silver and bronze medals in Athens in 2004. But Gatlin\u2019s triumph was soon dimmed by his association with his coach. In the months leading up to the Games, Graham\u2019s name became linked to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, or Balco \u2014 then the target of a widely publicized doping investigation that involved numerous pro athletes \u2014 suggesting he had helped an earlier generation of his athletes acquire steroids. Then, at the Olympics, Graham told reporters that he had anonymously mailed a syringe containing a steroid to the United States Anti-Doping Agency in an effort to implicate Balco.Executives from Nike and USA Track & Field were worried; they viewed Gatlin as the new and marketable face of American track. They told Gatlin he had to be beyond reproach, meeting with him, his parents and his agent, Renaldo Nehemiah, who would later refer to this as a \u201ccoming-to-Jesus talk.\u201d Yet Gatlin elected to remain with Graham. Pro runners are loners, one bad injury removed from obscurity. The eighth-ranked sprinter in the world makes a fraction of the riches that go to the top ranked; sponsors want winners, and Graham had helped Gatlin win.The financial blow was immediate. Nike dropped him, as did other sponsors. His income, expected to reach $2.5 million that year, disappeared. He sold his house in North Carolina and ended up in a small bug-infested apartment in Atlanta. He had to ask his mother if he had enough money to buy jeans. \u201cI was collecting unemployment checks and eating ramen noodles,\u201d Gatlin says. \u201cYou go to the supermarket and you\u2019re marked. It feels like everyone is staring at you.\u201dHe never contested the doping result, but his admission was hedged. Gatlin speculated publicly that a masseur, disgruntled at the lack of a bonus, had spread steroid cream on him after a race. A three-person panel with the American Arbitration Association heard the case, and the majority decision concluded that Gatlin\u2019s testimony related to the cream \u201cwas not credible, was not substantiated.\u201d (One panel member dissented, saying Gatlin\u2019s account was credible.) The panel laid out a different scenario: Suffering from a hamstring tear in the spring of 2006, Gatlin was sent by his coach to see a doctor, who in turn let an assistant coach give an injection to Gatlin\u2019s thigh to speed healing. \u201cIt was a vitamin,\u201d Gatlin had told the arbitration panel. \u201cIt was supposed to help heal my torn hamstring and the microfiber tears and reduce swelling.\u201d The panel was skeptical. It pointed out that the coach could as easily have injected Gatlin with steroids, leading in turn to the positive test. World antidoping regulators take the view that athletes are responsible for what goes into their bodies and cannot blame their support staff.A federal investigator, Jeffrey Novitzky, contacted Gatlin and asked if he would work undercover to help build a steroid trafficking case. (Novitzky also led the Balco investigation.) If Gatlin lied or tipped off anyone, Novitzky told him, he would be prosecuted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask to think about it,\u201d Novitzky, who now works for the U.F.C., told me this spring. \u201cHe said he had nothing to hide.\u201d Gatlin recorded 11 conversations with Graham. When I asked Gatlin about that time, he shook his head in disbelief. \u201cIt was like living in a soap opera, or a spy novel.\u201d Though Gatlin\u2019s recordings did not uncover new evidence of wrongdoing by Graham, the coach would later be convicted of a felony for lying to federal investigators.That Gatlin earned his suspension is beyond doubt. Still, a question nagged at me, and I put it to Novitzky: Did Gatlin dope intentionally or was he far too credulous? Novitzky paused. \u201cAthletes who test positive don\u2019t materialize out of thin air,\u201d he told me. \u201cJustin surrounded himself with questionable people and needed better judgment. He did not do due diligence.\u201dI asked again: Did Gatlin know? He hesitated again. Gatlin had helped him, of course, but he has also worked with a wide range of informants. \u201cI had many years of training in how to read untruthfulness,\u201d Novitzky said. \u201cUnless Justin was an Academy Award-winning actor, I didn\u2019t see evidence of purposeful, knowing use.\u201dIn 2010, in an early comeback meet in Finland, he ran the 100 meters in 10.28 seconds. That\u2019s blindingly fast for a normal person and a slog through mud for a top-end sprinter. \u201cLet\u2019s be real,\u201d Gatlin says. \u201cMy opponents were the best Finns in Helsinki. And I had to claw for every meter.\u201d Two years later, Gatlin was back in the Olympics, where he won a bronze medal at the London Games, finishing a couple of strides behind Bolt. At 30, Gatlin had no real plan for coming up with those missing strides.One night while scrolling through Facebook he came across the coach Dennis Mitchell, who was known to be obsessed with proper technique, and sent him a message. \u201cIt took Dennis a month to reply,\u201d Gatlin says. \u201cHe\u2019s not computer savvy.\u201d Mitchell, a top 100-meter sprinter who was caught doping in 1998 (at the time, he attributed the positive test to five beers and lots of sex with his fianc\u00e9e), possessed swagger, knowledge and a hunger for redemption as great as Gatlin\u2019s. \u201cDennis was like, \u2018We\u2019re training for gold, period,\u2019 \u201d Gatlin says. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to hear.\u201dMitchell dismantled and reconstructed Gatlin\u2019s form, from start to stride. Nothing about the process was polite: No, that\u2019s not right, do it again. Do it again. \u201cIt was like \u2018Rocky,\u2019 \u201d Gatlin says. \u201cI wanted to kill him some days.\u201d In the evenings, Gatlin watched hours of video \u2014 of himself and of sprinters past, going back to Jesse Owens. To view Gatlin\u2019s races from his early 20s is to see a runner relying far less on technique than on intense competitiveness and raw talent.Gatlin changed that. He began exploding out of the blocks. His drive phase, in which a runner reaches maximum speed, became tight, with an emphasis on quick strides. A sprinter reaches peak speed at about 70 meters; any appearance of increasing speed after that is an optical illusion. By 2014, having overhauled his mechanics and diet \u2014 he weighed 174 pounds, down from 205 pounds at the beginning of his comeback, his muscles now long rivers instead of thick knots \u2014 he began to win every time out. And after every race, Gatlin heard the same doubting questions from reporters: How are your times possible? Are you doping? Did you apologize for your doping? Each question was more or less reasonable; collectively, heard day after day, they were difficult to answer with equanimity.Gatlin was not interested in equanimity. Stubborn anger and hurt fueled him. \u201cDennis trained me like a sensei trained his warrior,\u201d he says. \u201c \u2018Remember your ethos! Don\u2019t give them nothing!\u2019 \u201d Anger made Gatlin \u2014 who laughs easily with fellow runners and shows grace with teenagers seeking autographs and selfies \u2014 unlikable as a public figure. Last year, he barked at reporters who asked about doping. \u201cWhy would I answer that? I answered it 10 years ago.\u201dThis April, I traveled through the pine forests of Central Florida \u2014 Gatlin lives in Clermont, outside Orlando \u2014 and found him seated underneath the stands at a track meet in Gainesville, waiting out a downpour. He spoke of taking months off after that Beijing race against Bolt, the longest break he\u2019d ever allowed himself. \u201cPeople who love me, they said: \u2018Why are you doing this to yourself?\u2019 \u201d Gatlin recalled. \u201cEven a warrior puts that sword and shield down.\u201dEarly in his comeback, Gatlin saw his role as, in his words, the \u201cthe Batman of track, a vigilante.\u201d While Bolt smiled and pantomimed shooting an arrow, Gatlin scowled. But he came to find the mask becoming the face. \u201cI was too angry; it was deteriorating my character,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t like who I had become.\u201dOne afternoon a teenager at a local gym invited Gatlin to attend his church. The teenager did not let on that his father was the pastor. Gatlin took a seat in the pews. The pastor, Everett Gates, had left a handsome salary at a big church in Atlanta to found his own, much smaller congregation. He knew who Gatlin was, and so what? In the weeks to come, Gatlin talked with Gates. \u201cJustin told me, \u2018I\u2019m focused on running, but I want to be at peace,\u2019 \u201d Gates recalls.Top runners from different Florida camps found their way to this little church. It became that rare place where they could shed their competitive armor. \u201cTrust is not part of their sport,\u201d Gates says. One Sunday, Gates recalls, he asked who wanted to find God, and Gatlin raised his hand. Gatlin walked over and held the pastor in an embrace, and cried uncontrollably. \u201cPastor, I am broken,\u201d Gatlin said. \u201cCompletely broken.\u201dGatlin got off to a slow start this season. He had a serious ankle sprain; he was 34; perhaps age finally had put in a grappling hook. But a few weeks ago, at the Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., he ran a 9.83 in the semifinals. Ninety minutes later, he ran a 9.80 in the finals, the fastest time in the world this year.I visited Gatlin the next day in a house where his family was staying during the trials. The sunlight through the pines was dappled, and his son, Jace, played with puzzles on the floor as Gatlin talked with affection of a young runner, Trayvon Bromell, who also made the American team as a 100-meter sprinter. \u201cTrayvon, he is like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me.\u201dGatlin knows that his generation is dropping away. Bolt told me this Olympics would be his last. Gatlin spoke of the grind of training, taking Epsom salt baths and ice baths and trying to fall asleep at 2 a.m. after a race, his mind still afire. \u201cI know how old I am every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cEach year, it becomes harder to draw on something to keep that edge.\u201d The longer he runs, and the better his times, the more questions circle around him. Several European athletes have denounced him. In early March, the American middle-distance runner Alysia Monta\u00f1o told reporters at an Olympics press event that Gatlin should be barred from the Games. \u201cYou are 100 percent held accountable for what you put in your body,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, someone gave me a massage.\u2019 \u201dDoes he hear that disbelief? He smiled faintly. He has said many times that he is not doping. He noted that his 6-year-old son sat on his lap for the post-race news conference at the United States trials, and he spoke of the joy that brought him. Maybe that would be enough. Or maybe not. I asked if he had thought about retirement. He shook his head. \u201cBeing suspended, losing all those years, it\u2019s like I constantly have to prove a point,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop yet. I can\u2019t.\u201dMichael Powell writes the Sports of The Times column.By Michael Sokolove. Photographs by Erik Madigan HeckLedecky, 19, is also happy, seemingly just about all the time. When you start listing the factors that make her so freakishly good at what she does, being freakishly happy has to rank very high. She rarely has anxieties about her swimming or anything else, and when she does, she says: \u201cI can get rid of them. I\u2019m pretty good at doing that. If I\u2019m worried about something, I\u2019m able to make myself just think about something else.\u201dThe sport she has come to dominate makes almost impossible demands of the body and spirit. It imposes a ratio of hard training to exhilaration that is depressingly out of whack. Top swimmers train as often as nine times a week, 50-plus weeks a year, with their heads submerged in water for two or more hours at each of those sessions. What they hear is the rhythm of their own strokes, their teammates\u2019 kicking, their coach\u2019s muffled voice. One of the sport\u2019s cruelties is that all this extreme training produces, on the whole, lackluster competitive performances. Swimmers try to peak just once or twice a year, and they prepare for these occasions in scientific and ritualistic ways. They swim fewer yards in the weeks leading up to a big competition, in order to be rested and fresh. They also, on the eve of major races, shave: women their legs and arms, men their legs, arms, chests, backs and sometimes their heads. The idea is to feel sleek and fast in the water.Ledecky wants practices and all but the biggest meets to feel harder, not easier. \u201cI haven\u2019t shaved my legs since Russia,\u201d she told me late last year in one of our first conversations, referring to a competition many months earlier. She laughed, which she does often. She has a big, engaging smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s probably too much information, right?\u201dHis daughter, though, was quietly setting goals, sharing them only with her coach \u2014 first, make the Olympic trials, then qualify for the Summer Games. In one of her first meets with world-class competition, she swam a 400-meter freestyle against Allison Schmitt, a top American swimmer who is seven years older. \u201cI gave her a bit of a race,\u201d is how Ledecky recalls it. \u201cAfter that, I knew I could compete against those people. I wasn\u2019t afraid to race them.\u201dIn 2012 in London, Ledecky, a little-known 15-year-old, won the gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle, defeating Rebecca Adlington, a British swimmer and world-record holder so heavily favored that Prince William, Kate Middleton and other members of the British royal family were in attendance at the Olympic aquatic center, anticipating a coronation. As the crowd chanted Adlington\u2019s name, Ledecky channeled its energy and imagined the shouts were \u201cLedecky, Ledecky, Ledecky.\u201d In the four years since, she has been on a world-record spree, setting them at all times of the year and over a stunning range of distances. First she established her supremacy in the distance freestyles, then she took command of shorter events. She is now the world\u2019s top female swimmer in the 200, 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyles. She is among the best Americans in the 100 free. No swimmer has conquered this combination of distances in nearly half a century, and to many in the sport, her achievement is hard to fathom \u2014 it would be like the Jamaican star sprinter Usain Bolt taking up and winning mile races.In mid-January, I attended a three-day meet at the University of Texas in Austin. A large contingent of top American and international swimmers were there. Most of them talked about using the weekend to measure the state of their training; no one, or almost no one, was expecting to produce particularly fast results.On the day before the racing began, Ledecky, who took a gap year after high school to train for the Olympics before she enrolls at Stanford this September, was led into a small media room by a staff member of USA Swimming. Not uncommon for a swimmer, she can seem a little awkward on land, and she approached the lectern with a gangly, slightly slope-shouldered gait. When the questioning began, she seemed to try to fall in line with the other swimmers\u2019 modest goals. She said, for example, that she was just hoping to \u201cimplement\u201d some of what she had been working on in practices. A poised public speaker, she referred to the coming competition more than once as \u201cone of these kinds of meets\u201d \u2014 meaning not too big a deal. But when someone asked what times she anticipated, she smiled, and it was a thinner smile, almost a smirk. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a good weekend,\u201d she said. It was Ledecky\u2019s demure way of saying: Keep your eye on me.On the meet\u2019s last day, she broke her own world record in the 800 freestyle, her 11th world mark since London. At the United States Swim Trials in Omaha, Neb., earlier this summer, she won three events. She could end up with four or possibly even five gold medals in Rio, depending on how many relays she participates in. The first eight nights of NBC\u2019s Olympic coverage will focus on swimming, with about 90 minutes of live coverage from the pool every evening, and Ledecky will play a starring role. She will get the kind of exposure that recent American Olympians have eagerly converted into riches, but Ledecky has distinguished herself in another way too: She has not become a professional athlete. This has little to do with pursuing some notion of Olympic purity, which never existed anyway; instead, it is a savvy decision that serves her swimming and may very well give her a competitive advantage. While some others are out chasing endorsement dollars, she is focused only on gold.In Austin, I sat down with Bob Bowman, Michael Phelps\u2019s coach, whom I first met while writing about Phelps when he was roughly the same age that Ledecky is now. \u201cShe has an intensity to her swimming that I have never seen in a distance athlete,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s completely fearless\u201d \u2014 by which he meant she goes out fast without the fear of fading at the end.Swimming is a highly technical sport, and there are different approaches to each stroke, but Ledecky\u2019s freestyle is a near replica of Phelps\u2019s. In what she recalls as a \u201ceureka moment,\u201d it was taught to her in 2011, when she was 14, by her coach Yuri Suguiyama, who has since moved on to become the associate head coach of the men\u2019s swim team at the University of California, Berkeley. He showed her a video of Phelps setting a world record in a 200 free at a world championship meet, and they set out to copy his form.Unlike Phelps, whose physique is built for swimming \u2014 a long torso, big hands that serve as paddles and relatively short legs (which create less drag in the water) \u2014 Ledecky is unremarkably proportioned. She describes her stroke as \u201cloping,\u201d but there is nothing leisurely-looking about it. She has what swim coaches call a \u201chigh elbow catch\u201d and a quick connection to the water. Her arms are never up in the air very long. Like Phelps, she has a \u201cgallop\u201d in her stroke: She glides on one side just an instant longer, like a sailboat keeling.Her future coach at Stanford, Greg Meehan, uses the term \u201caquatic strength\u201d in talking about her prowess, adding that it\u2019s hard to quantify and not related to how much weight a person can lift in a gym. \u201cShe grabs a lot of water and holds onto it through every stroke,\u201d is how he explains it. \u201cAnd she is able to do that again and again, without letting up.\u201dUntil the year of the London Games, Ledecky breathed to both sides, every third stroke, but that creates too much side-to-side body sway for efficient racing. She now breathes to her right side, with her left arm in the water \u2014 and so smoothly that the goggle on her left eye never comes fully out of the water. You wonder how she even gets air.\u201cHer form is as close to perfect as exists,\u201d says Russell Mark, a former college swimmer with a degree in aerospace engineering who is a high-performance consultant for USA Swimming. Mark compiles metrics for America\u2019s top swimmers. His numbers indicate that Ledecky has been steadily increasing her tempo \u2014 turning her strokes over faster \u2014 while also improving the quality of her stroke, meaning each one takes her farther. This combination is enormously difficult to accomplish. When younger swimmers increase their tempo, they often \u201cspin\u201d \u2014 they don\u2019t get anywhere \u2014 but even the best swimmers can fall into a version of the same trap. In her 800-meter races, in which her world record is 8:06.68, Ledecky is now completing a full cycle \u2014 or strokes with each arm \u2014 approximately every 1.4 seconds. After her push off the wall, she covers 50 meters with 20 cycles.\u201cPeople trying to go fast are like animals,\u201d said Bowman, who happens to own thoroughbreds and sees in them some of the same biomechanical habits of the swimmers he trains. \u201cYou watch a horse. The first thing they do is increase their stride length. And the second thing is the rate. She followed the natural progression. She picked up the rate of her stroke to keep the thing moving forward, which is how she got from 8:14 to 8:06 in the 800. Sooner or later she\u2019ll have to go back to length. It\u2019s a balance. You can\u2019t just do one or the other.\u201dLedecky\u2019s competitiveness is apparent at practices and in meets, even if it is expressed quietly. About 15 minutes before their events, swimmers gather in a \u201cready room\u201d that usually consists of a few rows of chairs and a TV showing the races. Ledecky invariably sits in a kind of trance with her parka zipped up and her hood pulled over her head. The intensity she radiates causes even friends to keep their distance. \u201cAt practice, she\u2019s a nice girl,\u201d Anna Belousova, a 19-year-old Russian breaststroker who trains with Ledecky, told me. \u201cAt meets, I\u2019m afraid to go near her.\u201dOne afternoon this spring, I was sitting with Ledecky by the pool at Georgetown Prep, an all-boys school where her team, the Nation\u2019s Capital Swim Club, practices. A couple of freshmen came over and asked for an autograph, and she signed. I suggested to her that she seemed to enjoy beating her opponents, not just by a bit, but really crushing them. \u201cSure I do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can be nice when you race. But it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019m mostly focused on my own time, and you\u2019ve got to be mean to the clock, right?\u201dIn the starting blocks before a race, Ledecky does not stroke her biceps or pound her fists against her own body, as some male swimmers do. (In Omaha, a swimmer billing himself as the Dark Knight went to the blocks in a Batman mask.) She just stretches her neck a bit and shakes her arms out, then dives in the pool and wins.In Bethesda, Ledecky trains with about 30 swimmers, spread out over eight lanes, coached by Bruce Gemmell and two assistant coaches. But she has only three real training partners, all of them male, because they are the only ones with the ability to keep up with her. They swim either in the same lane or in an adjoining lane to Ledecky. Her training mates told me that when they are supposed to be going at a slower pace \u2014 practices consist of repeated sets of distances swum at variable rates of speed and effort \u2014 she tends to swim fast, pulling the whole group along with her. The ability to coast is something she either does not want or does not have. Ledecky told me that sometimes she has bad days at practice, when she is just not feeling energetic, and shrugs them off. If she has two in a row, it frustrates her. Her aerobic fitness is a combination of her genetics \u2014 her \u201cbig engine,\u201d as Meehan, the Stanford coach says \u2014 and the fact that she works so hard.It\u2019s not unusual for men and women swimmers to train together, but being in the pool with Ledecky is something that many men can\u2019t handle. In April, Conor Dwyer, a 6-foot-5, 27-year-old American swimmer who won a gold medal in the 4-by-200 freestyle relay in London, gave a revealing interview posted online by USA Swimming. In it, he talked about male swimmers being \u201cbroken\u201d by Ledecky when they practiced together at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.\u201cShe is no easy task to beat in practice, even as a male,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get broken by her, so I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d He added: \u201cI saw her break a lot of guys in practice. ... What I mean is if we\u2019re doing a 3K threshold\u201d \u2014 30 all-out 100 frees \u2014 \u201cshe\u2019ll just start beating you every single hundred, and slowly but surely you get broken like you do in a long race, like a mile. Your morale goes down pretty quickly when you get broken by a female in practice. I saw a couple of guys have to get yanked out of workout because they got beat by her.\u201dWhen I asked Ledecky about this, she claimed not to have noticed. \u201cI was probably just concentrating on doing my own work,\u201d she said.Ledecky\u2019s training partners include Andrew Gemmell, the coach\u2019s son, who is 25 and finished ninth in the 1,500 at the 2012 London Games, and Matthew Hirschberger, 17, who competed at this summer\u2019s Olympic trials and is one of the nation\u2019s top young middle-distance swimmers. (Neither qualified for the games in Rio.) \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, it can be annoying when she beats you,\u201d Hirschberger told me. Even if the person getting the best of him is a reigning world-record holder in three events? \u201cYou\u2019re just not used to getting beat by a girl,\u201d he said.When Gemmell swam for the college team at Georgia, he trained with both male and female Olympians. \u201cLook, I understand, he\u2019s a little younger,\u201d he said, when I told him what Hirschberger had shared. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little more of a perspective. There have been a couple of times where I\u2019ve come really close to asking my dad: Can I pop out of practice to watch? Because what\u2019s going on next to me is just ridiculous. It\u2019s unreal.\u201dLedecky\u2019s ability to crush men in practice does not necessarily mean she would defeat them in competition. There\u2019s a difference between imposing her will, and perhaps superior conditioning, over the course of a two-hour practice and doing it in a shorter race in which men\u2019s generally greater strength provides an advantage. Her best chance would probably be in the 1,500 freestyle, which women race at the FINA World Championships but not at the Olympics. (The men don\u2019t swim the 800 in the Olympics, so there are the same number of events for male and female swimmers.) Ledecky\u2019s best time in the event would put her among the dozen or so top American men and is 25 seconds faster than their qualifying time at the United States Olympic trials \u2014 but it is much too slow to earn a medal at the Games. On the other hand, because no other woman offers a real challenge to her, she is never pushed in that event. I asked Andrew Gemmell, who specializes in the 1,500 free, a hypothetical question: What if, in some dystopian swim universe, Ledecky was told that there would be no women\u2019s events and that she would have to try to make the American team by competing with the men in the 1,500?His father, who trains her, had told me that he did not think she could qualify, a feat that under current rules would require her to finish first or second at the trials. Andrew, who trains side by side with her, had a different answer. \u201cIt would be really difficult, but I would never bet against her,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows yet what she\u2019s capable of.\u201dLedecky is, in a sense, the last amateur of the Olympic Games. She is not the only Olympian who has opted against turning pro \u2014 in many sports, there is no appreciable money to be made \u2014 but she is the only one at her exalted level. In order to accept a swimming scholarship at Stanford, she chose to pass up millions of dollars in potential endorsement contracts.For many years, Olympians had to remain amateurs, at least ostensibly. The \u201camateur ideal\u201d may have been outdated from the start, and it hurt many athletes, going all the way back to Jim Thorpe, who was stripped of his medals from the 1912 Games when it was later discovered that he had accepted money to play semipro baseball. (The medals were restored posthumously.) But professionalism has its own costs. At the Olympic trials in Omaha, it was hard to miss the pure joy with which Ledecky seemed to be swimming, especially compared with rivals who spoke of the immense pressure they were feeling. It helped, of course, that she was so far ahead of her competition and did not really have to worry about qualifying. But one reason for this might be that she has achieved an ideal that is so difficult for others to reach \u2014 truly racing for herself. \u201cThe more money that gets put into something, the more it gets messed up,\u201d Bowman, Phelps\u2019s coach, told me. \u201cNobody is demanding her time. She never misses a day. That\u2019s how you maintain that level.\u201dThere are just a handful of swimmers who have made life-changing money from the sport, but for those who do, most notably Phelps, it can be a lot. \u201cShe would have had the earnings potential that no one but Michael has had, if she wanted it,\u201d Bowman said. I asked Matt Powell, a sports-industry analyst with the NPD Group, a market-research firm, about Ledecky\u2019s commercial value. \u201cShe has a terrific personality \u2014 great kid, great smile, she\u2019s excelling at a really high level,\u201d he said. \u201cThe endorsement side could be worth millions to her, as much as $10 to $15 million per year.\u201dAt different times, I heard Ledecky\u2019s coach, Bruce Gemmell, say that she was going to be a performer \u201cin NBC\u2019s billion-dollar reality show,\u201d referring to the network\u2019s telecasts from Rio. It was said with an edge. Her parents and coach well understand, of course, why she matters to NBC and the vast commercial enterprise of the Games. The network\u2019s cameras gravitate to American winners, and she is the surest bet. Phelps, now 31, is back in the water after a brief retirement and then a suspension after a second arrest on D.U.I. charges, but he will be entered in fewer events than he raced in his prime \u2014 and he won\u2019t be a solid favorite in any of them. The American swim team, both the men and the women, looks weaker than it has in past Olympiads, based on the times in Omaha; swimmers like Ryan Lochte and Missy Franklin, who starred in past Summer Games, will most likely have to improve their times to compete for gold. Ledecky won three events in Omaha \u2014 the 200 freestyle, in which she is likely to be challenged by the Italian star Federica Pellegrini for gold, and the 400 and 800 frees, in which she looks untouchable. She could also win medals in the 4-by-200 freestyle relay and, if coaches place her in it, the 4-by-100 relay.Her parents zealously protect her time and have rejected requests from the late-night shows \u2014 and even NBC Sports and USA Swimming \u2014 when they felt it would interfere with her preparation. They attend almost all her meets and will be in Rio, but they avoid attention. Her father often sits in corners of arenas where the TV cameras won\u2019t find him. \u201cYou can sit there stoically while she\u2019s swimming or jump up and down,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like an idiot one way or the other.\u201d The family discussed whether she should turn pro, but it was never seriously considered, they say, nor did they really endeavor to attach a number to how much money she might be passing up.To turn pro at a young age means separating from peers who have gone off to college and instead joining a training group of other professional swimmers, all of them most likely older. There is a risk that an already difficult sport will become a lonely one too. Ledecky is aware, as well, that several female swimmers who turned professional out of high school have experienced steep declines in their performance. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really tempt me,\u201d Ledecky says. \u201cNobody ever told me, \u2018You\u2019ll get this certain amount of money if you go pro.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what it would be, but it\u2019s not something that bothers me.\u201dThe decision that Ledecky made was one she could make. The youngest of two children, she has grown up in a fair degree of comfort. Her father is a lawyer, and her mother, Mary Gen, a former college swimmer, worked as a hospital administrator, and they now spend much of their time shuttling their daughter to and from practices. Her older brother graduated from Harvard in May. An uncle, Jonathan Ledecky, is a venture capitalist and co-majority owner of the New York Islanders. Ledecky is an excellent student, and whenever she puts swimming behind her, she should have a Stanford degree to add to what will, in all likelihood, be a display case full of Olympic gold medals.But there is also the possibility that we are just at the beginning of her reign. Four years ago, Ledecky was the youngest swimmer, male or female, on the American team in London. She will be the youngest again in Rio. And four years from now, at the Summer Games in Tokyo, she will be just 23 and probably still in her prime.She has said that after this summer, she will probably put more work into the shorter races, including the 100, which she did not qualify for at the trials in Omaha. She could start competing in the 400 individual medley, which combines all four competitive strokes (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle); she ranks among the top Americans in the event even though it has been an afterthought for her. But to continue setting new world records in the distance events, she may need something that\u2019s out of her control \u2014 real competitors.No other woman has ever come within seven seconds of her top time in the 800 freestyle; in the 1,500, the gap is a ridiculous 13 seconds. At the Olympic trials, Leah Smith, an emerging middle-distance swimmer, came within two seconds of her in the 400. She said she was excited because, in her races against Ledecky, \u201cI had never been able to see her feet before.\u201dRowdy Gaines, the longtime commentator on NBC\u2019s swim telecasts and himself an Olympic gold medalist, told me that Ledecky is already the most dominant swimmer he has seen in his four decades in the sport, even more so than Phelps. \u201cMichael had rivals, swimmers who could stay at least somewhat close to him,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Katie\u2019s best events, she has none. To be fair, they are longer races. But she\u2019s swimming them by herself.\u201dMichael Sokolove is a contributing writer for the magazine.Photographs by Erik Madigan Heck. As told to Jaime Lowe.Allyson Felix (bottom), 30, Track and FieldMedals: Gold, 200 meters, 4x100-meter relay, 4x400-meter relay (2012), 4x400-meter relay (2008); silver, 200 meters (2008), 200 meters (2004)I compete in a sport that is decided by one one-hundredth of a second. It\u2019s difficult to be in a sport that measures you that way. Joanna was very transparent about what it took to get the gold medal. She was always going above what the standard was; I saw that, no matter what, I always have to push harder. When I run, I don\u2019t notice anything: It\u2019s just me and the track and nothing else. I\u2019m there to do a job. I know that anything less than winning a gold medal is failure.Medals: Gold, 100-meter hurdles (2004)Allyson is very different than anyone I\u2019ve ever met on the track. She was born with a gift that is unlike any I have ever seen \u2014 it\u2019s effortless. She\u2019s a gazelle when she runs: She just opens up these long legs and goes. I get bored when I just run. When I was younger, I thought hurdling was completely crazy. You fall all the time! I clipped three hurdles in a race in Athens, but I was able to keep going. It\u2019s just like in life: Make the right choice, don\u2019t mess this up.Simone Biles (right), 19, GymnasticsThese are her first Olympic Games.Dominique said, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone make the decision for you,\u201d when I was choosing between college and the Olympics. She emphasized that the decision was mine. The hardest part for me is knowing how mentally prepared I have to be. I overthink things sometimes. I want to go out there and have fun.The hardest on the floor is the double layout, full out. At first, I felt like I was stuck in the air and gravity was like, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m about to slam you right now.\u201d Now, I don\u2019t think about what I\u2019m doing \u2014 I have full control over everything, even in the air. We feel like we\u2019re flying, but flying with total control.Dominique Moceanu, 34, GymnasticsMedals: Gold, team competition (1996)Simone is a one-of-a-kind gymnast. She\u2019s a little powerhouse, she has fun and she loves the sport \u2014 she gets to be herself out there. She could come away as the first U.S. woman gymnast who wins more than two gold medals; she could win four or five, which is unheard-of. I couldn\u2019t go to my opening ceremonies because our coaches wouldn\u2019t let us. They were worried about us standing for over four hours, but we were in the best shape in our lives! I understand that they want you to be rested, but it should be a choice for the athletes. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re ever going to go to another Olympics.David Boudia, 27, DivingMedals: Gold, 10-meter platform (2012); bronze,synchronized 10-meter platform (2012)I wanted to be Apolo and dominate the sport. In both of our sports, one wrong move could be the end of the competition, or even the end of a career. When I started really diving, I was so fearful \u2014 I was basically jumping off a three-story building. I was afraid of the height, but when I dug deeper, I realized it was a fear of not being in control of everything. I had to let go and just let my training do the work. When you look at short-track speed skating, you\u2019re gliding around the track with these effortless movements, and that\u2019s what diving is, too.Apolo Ohno, 34, Short-track Speed SkatingMedals: Gold, 1,500 meters (2002), 500 meters (2006); silver, 1,000 meters (2002), 1,500 meters (2010); bronze, 1,000 meters, 5,000-meter relay (2006), 1,000 meters, 5,000-meter relay (2010)Imagine training eight or 12 years for a moment \u2014 40 seconds \u2014 that defines who you are as an athlete and as a person for years to come. To this day, I think I have never skated a perfect lap. It\u2019ll look perfect, but deep down, I always want to be more, I want to be better, better, better. Olympians are these superhero figures trapped in these normal-looking bodies, but once the curtain opens and it\u2019s time to shine, you feel like, This is why I am here on earth, I have this talent and have captured that lightning in a bottle.Kerri Walsh Jennings, 37, Beach VolleyballMedals: Gold (2004, 2008, 2012)I always had the standard male role models \u2014 I\u2019d watch Michael Jordan and think, That\u2019s a rad athlete \u2014 but when Mia came to the forefront on the national soccer team, I was so stoked to find a woman! She had the it factor, and she was everything I aspired to be. I admired her presence. She was so comfortable leading the ship: She rose to every occasion. It wasn\u2019t just fearlessness; it was a knowing belief in herself. I wanted that to translate into my game.Mia Hamm, 44, SoccerMedals: Gold (1996, 2004); silver (2000)It\u2019s completely transformed from where soccer was in \u201996 to where we are now. Now people know who the national team is. I had dreams about medaling, but the actual ceremony topped all of that. I just remember standing up there \u2014 you only get to hear your national anthem if you win, and we wanted to hear our anthem! Standing there with a medal around your neck, screaming at the top of your lungs and being able to look into a stadium full of cheering fans \u2014 it\u2019s amazing.Kayla Harrison, 26, JudoMedals: Gold, 78-kilogram division (2012)Jimmy\u2019s been my hero since I was 6 years old. I didn\u2019t have a lot of American athletes to look up to, and he was the most decorated judo athlete at the time. I met him when I was 9, and he signed a poster and my uniform and I thought, Someday I want to be as good as him.When I was 16, my first coach was arrested for sexually abusing me. I ended up in Jimmy\u2019s office, crying. I remember him looking at me and saying that what happened was wrong and that I needed to heal. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it, but he and his father saved my life.Jimmy Pedro, 45, JudoMedals: Bronze, 73-kilogram division (1996), 73-kilogram division (2004)When Kayla first came to us, she was completely broken down, completely torn apart. She didn\u2019t want to do judo, but it was the only thing she knew. Her parents basically said: Please rebuild this girl. We got her psychological assistance; judo was secondary. We got her around people who are positive, people with similar goals. We got her enrolled in high school, we gave her a job. She trained with Ronda Rousey, and it became her normal.As a coach, you always want your athletes to surpass what you did. That was my father\u2019s mentality too, when I went to the Olympics \u2014 I fulfilled his dream. When I was a young kid, my father was a huge fan of the Olympics. I watched every Olympic Games on the TV. Carl Lewis and Nadia Comaneci and Bruce Jenner \u2014 I was trying to be like them.Erik Madigan Heck is a photographer based in New York. His first major monograph, \u201cOld Future,\u201d will be published by Thames & Hudson this winter.Jaime Lowe is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn.By Carly CarioliDempsey understood Boston\u2019s appeal to the Games\u2019 organizers. In December 2014, shortly after Boston submitted its bid, the International Olympics Committee announced its \u201cAgenda 2020,\u201d a suite of reforms aimed at making the Games more affordable and sustainable and thus more accessible to smaller cities. It was an acknowledgment of criticism, following excesses like Beijing\u2019s starchitecture-studded 2008 spectacle, that the Olympics had become a showy indulgence for a handful of deep-coffered world cities and a boondoggle for everyone else.Boston, which was proposing a temporary stadium and a walkable footprint for the Games, seemed an ideal showpiece for this new direction. Dempsey had read in news reports that the I.O.C., which had not staged a summer Games in America since Atlanta in 1996, was eager to return to the United States. And the East Coast was one of the most lucrative time zones in the world for live broadcasts.Dempsey also understood what Boston\u2019s Olympics boosters thought the city would get out of the deal. In the vision they laid out to the city, the Games \u2014 or, more specifically, the billions in private funding promised by Boston\u2019s Olympic organizing committee \u2014 could provide the city with a cash infusion, and the infrastructure investments could help Boston make headway on its most intractable problems: worsening economic inequality, a lack of affordable housing and a crumbling public-transit system with an estimated $7 billion repair bill. Rather than leaving behind an architectural legacy of crumbling eyesores, as the Olympics infamously had elsewhere, the Boston Games would contribute to the permanent redevelopment of the city: the down-at-the-heels industrial district slated to host the temporary stadium would be reborn as a whole new mixed-income neighborhood called Midtown, and the Olympic Village would be transformed into housing for college students and senior citizens, among other things. It was a chance for one of America\u2019s most innovative and creative cities to reinvent itself and perhaps reinvent the Olympics in the process.But the more Dempsey thought about it, the less sense it all made. \u201cYou will be pulling time and attention away from education and housing and putting it into questions like \u2018Where does the velodrome go? Who\u2019s paying for it?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was very clear to me that if 2024 won, for a number of years leading up to 2024, the single biggest issue was going to be 2024.\u201d Dempsey found an ally in his friend Liam Kerr, the state director for Democrats for Education Reform. The two vowed to derail Boston\u2019s bid as quickly as possible. With little more than a Twitter account, a website and a PowerPoint presentation they threw together in a couple of weeks, they started an organization whose name spoke for itself: No Boston Olympics.The Olympics are often sold as a kind of gold medal for the world\u2019s brightest cities. They are seen as an opportunity to shine on the world stage and a financial prize to be reaped: hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue, plus billions in long-term economic development, all wrapped in a gleaming two-week-long pageant of international good will. But they are also an incredibly risky investment. Cities are forced to sign agreements promising extraordinary fiscal and regulatory power to Olympic organizers and to pick up the tab if the production goes overbudget, which it often does.Few cities have taken these lessons quite as much to heart as Boston, whose residents, led by Dempsey and Kerr\u2019s unexpected rebellion, shocked city leaders and the United States Olympic Committee last year by rejecting the proposal to host the 2024 Games, after a protracted and very public fight that the chief executive of the U.S.O.C., Scott Blackmun, would later call \u201cthe most unsettling and challenging time in my professional life.\u201d The defeat was all the more stunning because the Boston bid epitomized, for Olympics supporters inside and outside the city, a blueprint for a smarter, more impact-conscious Games. Instead, it became a referendum on the Olympics\u2019 ability to wreak political and fiscal havoc.Among them was Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. Zimbalist had stumbled into writing about the economics of baseball at the suggestion of his young son, and he began scrutinizing the deals that cities cut with baseball teams to build new stadiums. In 2003, Zimbalist was asked by the chairman of the Shubert Organization, Broadway\u2019s largest theater owner and operator, to take a look at the impact of New York\u2019s bid for the 2012 Olympics, which piqued his interest in the Games. In his book \u201cCircus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup,\u201d published amid the debate over Boston\u2019s proposal, Zimbalist dismantled the prevailing arguments that the Olympics led to long-term financial growth.The Olympics promised economic benefits to all, but in fact, Zimbalist wrote, the beneficiaries are usually few: construction companies, trade unions, architectural firms, investment banks and insurance companies. In other words, the winners just happen to be the same sorts of entities that often support Olympic bids in their cities. You might assume the hospitality industry would benefit, but studies showed it usually didn\u2019t. The direct tourism benefits of the Games were often more than offset with losses caused by congestion, elevated prices and security concerns.Zimbalist dissected the various costs of the Games and found that claims of budget surpluses were often built on hidden government subsidies. He argued that hosting the Olympics often increased inequality, because public housing was frequently demolished to make way for new venues. He found no evidence to suggest that hosting the Olympics helped cities attract new foreign investment.In fact, in the not-so-distant past, before the myth of the Olympics\u2019 economic benefits had taken hold, the Games were seen by many cities as a bad bet. When the I.O.C. went looking for a host city for the 1984 Games, it found virtually no takers; the memories of Munich 1972 (the Palestinian terrorist attack) and Montreal 1976 (a financial disaster that would leave the city in debt for 30 years) were too fresh. Los Angeles finally broke the losing streak in 1984, hosting a turmoil-free Games and turning a nominal profit, but this was partly because the city had more pre-existing sports infrastructure than others did and partly because, as the only city willing to host the Games, it was able to cut a better deal with the I.O.C., which waived its customary demand that the host city pay for any cost overruns and revenue shortfalls. Los Angeles was the exception, not the rule.Los Angeles might have been the exception, rather than the rule, but it nevertheless bolstered the dream of a profitable Olympics. For a couple of decades, the world\u2019s great cities competed vigorously for the honor of hosting the games. In recent years, however, reluctance has once again crept in. Four of the six cities initially bidding for the 2022 Olympics in 2013 and 2014 eventually pulled out of the running.The Boston Games, boosters argued, would be smaller, more sustainable and more transparent in their planning than past Olympics. But from the beginning, the process seemed suspiciously tight-lipped. Under pressure from the U.S.O.C. to keep details of the bid secret, Boston 2024 failed to reach out to community partners until it was too late, and its own disclosures were outflanked by details uncovered through public-records requests by sleuthing newspaper columnists and citizen journalists. In November 2014, it was revealed that Boston 2024\u2019s plans included taking over Franklin Park in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood, the crown jewel in the city\u2019s Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Emerald Necklace, an idea about which the boosters had not yet consulted the public-private partnership that helped manage the park. \u201cThat\u2019s when I got really scared,\u201d John Ruch, then the editor of The Jamaica Plain Gazette, says. \u201cI started to panic.\u201d He published a scathing editorial railing against Boston 2024 as a \u201csecretive, private committee of tycoons and special interests,\u201d then called for residents to organize to oppose it. Within 12 hours, they did.Ruch expected resistance to the Olympics would come from baby boomers weaned on the transportation fights of the 1960s and \u201970s. Instead, the movement Ruch inspired \u2014 an eventual ad hoc, grass-roots ally to Dempsey\u2019s and Kerr\u2019s No Boston Olympics, called No Boston 2024 \u2014 was organized by younger activists who had been involved with the Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter and the A.C.L.U. Within three days they held a public meeting in a church, an event notable enough that Boston 2024 sent a delegation including Doug Rubin, the state\u2019s most-celebrated political strategist, who had recently helped put Elizabeth Warren in the Senate.In truth, Bostonians were lukewarm about the Olympics from the beginning. Support for the Games peaked in January 2015, just after Boston was named the U.S.O.C.\u2019s bid city, with polls showing 51 to 55 percent of those surveyed in the greater Boston area in favor. By contrast, 67 percent of New Yorkers initially supported hosting the 2012 Games. When Chicago was competing for the 2016 Games, support reached 75 percent but plunged below 50 percent when the city admitted it, like Boston, would have to sign a taxpayer guarantee.Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, insisted that polls would show that the majority of people were excited about the Games. But the polls instead showed lukewarm support. Steve Koczela, president of the MassInc Polling Group, who conducted surveys throughout the campaign, says that \u201cwhat happened was, the more people learned about it, the more they thought they would be on the hook to pay for it.\u201d By March, approval numbers bottomed out at just 36 percent. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re competing against cities and countries where 75 or 80 or 90 percent want the Olympics,\u201d Koczela told me, \u201cthat\u2019s not good enough.\u201dBy spring, the bungled bid rollout, the sagging poll numbers and a series of contentious public meetings had Boston 2024 playing defense. In May, Boston 2024\u2019s leader, John Fish, one of the city\u2019s most powerful businessmen, stepped down from day-to-day leadership of the bid. \u201cDemocracy can be very messy,\u201d he says today. \u201cAnd I think it got a little more messy than I thought it would.\u201d Boston 2024 prepared a last-ditch attempt to salvage Boston\u2019s bid, starting a belated effort to incorporate community feedback into the plan for the Games. But state officials had grown wary of what the state\u2019s secretary of transportation called, in an email to the governor\u2019s chief of staff, \u201cprojected costs ... based solely on \u2018back of the envelope\u2019 calculations\u201d and \u201cdisingenuous\u201d claims about where the money would come from. An independent report financed by the state would later conclude that Boston 2024 underestimated costs by as much as $970 million, while overstating likely revenue by more than $300 million.On a Monday in July 2015, Walsh strode to the lectern at a hastily convened news conference to say the city was pulling its support for the bid. But by then, the plan was essentially dead already. The U.S.O.C. turned its attention to Los Angeles, which remains a contender. (The host city will be announced next year.) Boston 2024 reportedly ended its campaign facing more than $4 million in debt.Today, Fish says he takes full responsibility for the loss. He concedes that his group should have taken the time, immediately after Boston was announced as the U.S.O.C.\u2019s bid city, to educate residents, gather feedback and incorporate public sentiment into the bid. \u201cIf we did it all over again, I think we\u2019d win,\u201d he said, \u201cand if someone asked me to do it all over again, I would absolutely do it all over again.\u201d But opponents insist the deal wouldn\u2019t have gotten any better. \u201cIt was not a plan that got screwed up,\u201d Ruch told me. \u201cIt was a scam that got exposed.\u201dFor the I.O.C., the Boston bid laid bare a paradox. The organization\u2019s Agenda 2020 might have argued for leaner, less-extravagant Games that wouldn\u2019t force smaller cities to take on untenable financial risk. But as the state-financed report suggests, the only truly foolproof way of mitigating the cost and risk of the Games would be to create permanent sites for the Winter and Summer Olympics to which the Games would return every four years. The next best thing would be returning the Games to a megacity that has already invested in the infrastructure needed to support them. What Boston demonstrated was that the twin dreams of making Olympics hosting more egalitarian and more affordable may ultimately not be reconcilable.Dempsey and his No Boston Olympics colleague Kelley Gossett flew to Hamburg, Germany, last October, to advise a group opposing an effort to bring the 2024 Games there. In November, Hamburg residents voted to withdraw the city\u2019s bid. \u201cI like to think that the I.O.C. has a lot to learn from what happened in Boston,\u201d Dempsey told me, \u201ceven if they are too proud to admit it.\u201dCarly Carioli is a Boston-based contributing editor at Politico Magazine.by The New York Times MagazineMEXICO CITY, 1968DICK FOSBURY OUTSMARTS THE HIGH JUMPBy Tom WhymanAs with any child, for me a large part of the joy of reading and thinking about sports was imagining that I myself might someday enjoy real sporting success. But I knew, having the sort of body that I did \u2014 overweight, flailing, racked by nervous tics \u2014 that I would never be able to enjoy this sort of success on the usual terms. Instead, I dreamed of finding some trick or innovation that would place me not just on everybody else\u2019s level, but above it: a new way of keeping goal in soccer, a new way of bowling a cricket ball.Really, I dreamed of being like Dick Fosbury.When he was growing up, in the 1950s and \u201960s, Dick Fosbury was a pretty mediocre athlete as well. He was a high jumper, but only after he failed to make it onto his school\u2019s football and basketball teams. And even when he started practicing the high jump seriously, in college, he still wasn\u2019t especially good at it. Using the standard techniques of the time, Fosbury was only able to clear a height of 5 feet 4 inches \u2014 well below anything like an Olympic standard.This all changed when Fosbury found his innovation. For whatever reason, Fosbury started leaping over the bar by pushing himself up back first, a bizarre technique that necessitated landing on his neck, looking every bit like a corpse being pushed out of a window. Coaches were skeptical, particularly about the technique\u2019s safety, but it worked: Fosbury instantly improved his personal best by six inches, and the \u201cFosbury Flop\u201d was born. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Fosbury definitively proved the superiority of his unorthodox method when, as an unheralded outsider, he used it to flop not only to the high-jump gold medal but to an Olympic record.The Fosbury Flop has since become the standard high-jump technique. But it retains, I think, an essential strangeness. Watching the high jumpers flop over the bar back first, I am fascinated by the fact that it would ever occur to someone to do that in the first place; it seems to run contrary to all the logic of the human body. And yet it is, objectively, the best way of jumping over a high bar that we know of. Fosbury discovered that, and what\u2019s more, he convinced the world of its correctness.The Olympics ostensibly celebrate human excellence. But all too often, what this means is extreme displays of mere human competence: We witness men and women who have spent their whole lives training to be the best in a particular discipline as it is traditionally practiced and as they have been coached. They are supposed to do some single thing that they have been told to do, exceptionally well, within the limits of the rules, so there is little room in their performances for creativity, innovation or cunning. But an athlete like Fosbury can give Olympic performance a twist \u2014 and the spontaneity of real art.SEOUL, 1988CARL LEWIS IS OUTRUNBy Carvell WallaceA funny thing happens when a hero stumbles: The qualities that made him great in the first place are instantly recast as the character defects that brought on his downfall. With that 1988 loss, Lewis was suddenly deemed too garish, too full of himself. The beauty and confidence we embraced four years earlier turned into categorical proof that Lewis lacked rigor, that a quiet, hardworking man from the cold north could simply outmuscle the spoiled American.If only it were that simple. Two days after the race, Johnson was informed that he had failed a doping test. The next day, the I.O.C. stripped him of his medal and declared Lewis the true victor. It would later emerge that Lewis himself had tested positive for banned substances during trials. Four of the top five finishers in the 100 that year would fail doping tests at some point in their careers, giving that championship a nickname that has stuck: \u201cthe Dirtiest Race in History.\u201dI was 13 that summer, watching on TV. I had just moved to Los Angeles to live with my mother, who had a lot in common with Lewis: She, too, was intense and exquisite, flamboyant and competitive. She, too, had that particular brand of beauty that can make you feel intimidated by someone at the same time you are irrefutably drawn to them. In my early years, when she and I were a nation\u2019s distance away from each other, she was only a dream to me, a promise of family and home; if I could just be with her again, everything would be wonderful. But in the summer of \u201988, our real life in Los Angeles was hot and severe. Eviction and homelessness threatened. I had discovered skateboarding and cursing in secret and drinking gin from a plastic bottle. I had discovered the freedom of leaving our small apartment to ride the bus through endless city blocks, watching the world from behind a graffiti-scrawled window.I had visited my mother in Los Angeles for the first time the summer of 1984. She lived in a studio apartment just four miles from the Olympic stadium where Carl Lewis was dominating men\u2019s track and field. His power seemed to inhabit the city: It was in the way the announcers talked about him, the way the cameras followed his every move, as if his most mundane gestures held the secret to otherworldly strength. It was in the prideful way my mother said his name, smiling and laughing, clapping her hands as though \u201cCarl Lewis\u201d were the most important words in a favorite hymn. That summer was the golden one, with my mother by my side and Carl Lewis forever on the victory podium.But by 1988, that was already a long time ago, a thin and indiscernible vapor of reverie. Growing up is a series of dreams evaporating; the reality is always more wearisome and less dignified than you had hoped. Carl Lewis lost in 1988. He went on to lose in other ways too: a bungled run for office, a notoriously botched attempt at the national anthem at a 1993 N.B.A. game. Each defeat felt personal. I wanted Lewis to be as great forever as he was in the summer of \u201984. I wanted whatever hope I had \u2014 for him, for my mother, for myself \u2014 to continue in a straight line until the end of time. But after he lost, nothing was the same. Nothing ever is.Carvell Wallace is a writer living in Oakland, Calif.LILLEHAMMER, 1994.TONYA HARDING AND NANCY KERRIGAN FACE OFF ON ICEBy Taffy Brodesser-AknerThe story most of us know is that in 1994, Kerrigan, an Olympic favorite for figure-skating gold, was kneecapped after a practice by a man she didn\u2019t recognize. A thing people often don\u2019t know is that it was never quite proved that Harding was responsible. It was her ex-husband and bodyguard who hatched the plot. Harding herself claims that she didn\u2019t know about it until after the attack, and she was never convicted of anything other than conspiracy to hinder prosecution, for not immediately telling authorities what she knew.At first, Harding represented all that I disliked about the Olympics. In 1991, when she became the first American to complete a triple axel in competition, she couldn\u2019t hold in her joy: She made a whooping face and tightened her fists into little balls of achievement right there on the ice, and I teared up even though I didn\u2019t want to. Thankfully, she also contained the essential ingredients for \u201990s-era tabloid scandal. She looked mean, with her narrow eyes and turned-up nose (a literal one, not a metaphorical one) and, despite being from Oregon, her fluffy Long Island bangs.And in her supposed greed and malevolence, she manifested the evil that lurks in the hearts of every second-placer, every understudy \u2014 an evil that the perpetual first-placers don\u2019t even realize they share (but do, or will the moment their luck turns). More than anything, she wanted to win. I have long been drawn to extreme cases of American exceptionalism, which, by my definition, involves people being willing to carry out actual crimes to achieve their American happiness, like a good job or a house in the suburbs or a gold medal at the Olympics.It got even better: Kerrigan still competed, but achieved silver to Oksana Baiul\u2019s gold. Harding had a shoelace malfunction and came in eighth. Kerrigan could be heard on a live microphone being unkind about Baiul\u2019s victorious weeping. Later, she claimed death threats prevented her from attending the closing ceremony, though some speculated that she left early to appear at a parade at Disney World, because Disney was one of her sponsors. The humanity! This I could watch.Having a scandal this tawdry brought a democracy to the Olympics that hadn\u2019t previously been there. America is made up of all kinds; the Olympics, less so. And if you are someone with a taste for the ugly or a taste for scandal, the Olympics so often leave you with something akin to self-loathing. That year, people like me, with dark hearts and what my mother calls \u201clow taste\u201d \u2014 we exist in droves, I\u2019m afraid \u2014 briefly understood why the rest of you enjoy this so very much.Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine.MEXICO CITY, 1968JOHN CARLOS AND TOMMIE SMITH RAISE THEIR FISTSBy Jacqueline WoodsonI knew that all these people \u2014 and a man named Malcolm X and a woman named Shirley Chisholm \u2014 had some connection to what I was beginning to understand as \u201cour people\u201d and \u201cour power.\u201d I knew that I was supposed to be proud to be black and that this pride was supposed to be a part of something larger and greater. I knew that my cornrows, as painful as they\u2019d been to style, were as much a part of that pride as the dashikis and Afros.Even as I took all of this in, the furry haze of being 5 kept me from making sense of it. And in the midst of this haze, two African-American men, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, having just won the gold and bronze medals in the men\u2019s 200-meter dash at the 1968 Olympics, climbed onto the medaling stands in Mexico City, lowered their heads and raised their black-gloved fists \u2014 to which the world just about lost its mind.Those fists traveled from Mexico City to the corners of every black home in America. So much of the world seemed angry at the audacity of our two new heroes, but the people I loved cheered, slapped each other five, cut articles from the newspaper, crowded around black-and-white screens to watch the moment televised and retelevised. A word I did not know yet \u2014 \u201csolidarity\u201d \u2014 flowed through their conversations.Years later, I would join the Flashettes, a girls\u2019 track team. We would compete against the Atoms; both teams sent Brooklyn girls to the Olympic trials and a few to the Games themselves. I would understand what it meant to \u201ctrial\u201d and to \u201cmedal.\u201d I would run the 200-meter dash in college. I would come to understand that the gesture Smith and Carlos made meant \u201cBlack Power,\u201d yes, but also something greater. It was a homage to the rights of all human beings, paid through the eyes and fists of two African-American champions. But at 5 years old, what I knew was that two of the fastest men in the world had stood and spoken to the people I loved, the boys with their Afro picks, the relatives in dashikis, the grown-ups beaming in the blue light of black-and-white television. And they spoke to me, a child who would one day be the fastest girl on the block but for that moment had simply this: a hand I could curl into a fist and lift high in the air.Jacqueline Woodson is the author of \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming.\u201d Her most recent novel, \u201cAnother Brooklyn,\u201d will be published Aug. 9.ATLANTA, 1996U.S. WOMEN\u2019S BASKETBALL FINDS ITS HEROESBy Jessica LutherWe were there to watch the U.S. women\u2019s team in Olympic competition. This was an epochal moment for women\u2019s basketball: For the first time, the Olympic team was composed of the best postcollegiate basketball players, selected more than a year before the Games. The roster was stacked with players now considered legends: Sheryl Swoopes, Dawn Staley, Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, Jennifer Azzi. They played 52 games, around the world, in preparation for the Atlanta Olympics, and won all 52 of them. This was the team whose popularity helped lead to the American Basketball League and the W.N.B.A. \u2014 which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.The day we attended, Team U.S.A. was still in the early rounds, so we saw them play Zaire, Australia or South Korea; I can\u2019t remember which, but it hardly matters. In the summer of 1996 I was tall, big-bodied, still trying to figure out how to move through a world that didn\u2019t accommodate six-foot-tall teenage girls very well. I had found just one place that did: a basketball court. I played center and forward on my eighth- and ninth-grade teams. I could block and rebound, sometimes without my feet leaving the floor. If I was on the post, I could use my size to make space and get the ball in the hoop. My body, finally, was made for something. People cheered me for it.And in that awkward body that I didn\u2019t yet know how to wear, I watched some of the best female athletes \u2014 women whose bodies looked like mine \u2014 play ball on the Olympic stage. I wasn\u2019t ever good enough to play basketball for much more than fun. But when I look at that photo, I remember how I imagined that the people around me in that stadium, watching those women play, might look over at me and think, \u201cShe\u2019s probably a basketball player too.\u201dJessica Luther is a freelance journalist. Her book, \u201cUnsportsmanlike Conduct: College Football and the Politics of Rape,\u201d will be published Sept. 6.CALGARY, 1988ELIZABETH MANLEY SKATES FOR SILVERBy Michelle DeanIf you remember the figure-skating competition at the 1988 Olympics in Calgary and you are not Canadian, it is undoubtedly because of Katarina Witt, the East German powerhouse who won gold. Witt had a knack for dramatic footwork and serious height on her jumps. She wore puffed sleeves and dark lipstick and thick eyeliner. \u201cShe certainly is a beautiful, beautiful lady\u201d \u2014 this was the sort of thing American sportscasters couldn\u2019t resist saying. Liz Manley, meanwhile, had strawberry-blonde hair that she stubbornly styled in a short mom cut; she tended to wear baby blue and hot pink. The American sportscasters\u2019 notes on her were sure to mention that she once had a nervous breakdown and \u201cput on a tremendous amount of weight.\u201d This meant that she tipped the scales at more than 120 pounds when, as a teenager, she was sent off to Lake Placid by herself to train.Canadians muttered to one another about this. Complaining about the anti-Canadian bias in American coverage is an Olympic tradition for us. In the end, though, Manley defied the sportscasters. In the long program, aided by a middling Witt performance and a disastrous one from poor Debi Thomas of the American team, Manley gave the performance of her life. Her jumps took her higher than she\u2019d been accustomed to; every landing was precise, flawless. She won the silver medal and nearly knocked Witt out of the gold. It was a true upset \u2014 a huge triumph for a person who hadn\u2019t been expected to win a thing. Canadians celebrated as though she topped the podium.Americans think this sort of thing is adorable. \u201cSilver \u2014 a.k.a. \u2018Canadian gold,\u2019\u2009\u201d texted one American acquaintance when I tried to explain this to him. This is the joke about us that Americans alone seem to be amused by: that we are, in some essential way, a bit bovine \u2014 soft-eyed and complacent, even in defeat.It seems impossible to explain this to Americans, but not really being expected to win is, typically, the Canadian national position. We are O.K. with this. The jury is still out on whether Justin Trudeau will do anything to alter this situation, though I personally doubt it. The soul of our country prizes solid competence, which is what makes Canada a very nice place to live much of the time. Excellence is an afterthought, a lovely dividend that is not entirely expected. This may mean that we get very few gold medals, but we will always have the particular sort of pride that comes with saying we did our best, nobody lost their head and everything was accomplished with a minimum of self-aggrandizement, megalomania or unrealistic expectations. This is a deeply underrated variety of satisfaction. More countries should try it.Michelle Dean is a writer whose first book, \u201cSharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,\u201d will be published next year.BEIJING, 2008LOLO JONES MEETS THE NINTH HURDLEBy Greg HowardBut on the ninth, her front heel caught the hurdle. She stumbled through it, but the lost momentum left her flailing while the women around her sailed smoothly past. Jones crossed the finish line seventh and then collapsed, her legs buckling beneath the heartbreak.I watched Jones from my dorm room, where I was preparing for my final season as a collegiate soccer player. The game was, for me, a language all its own \u2014 a system of manipulations of the ball with my feet, thighs, chest and head; a way of moving in tandem with 10 other men, navigating through opposing defenses with a glossary of loud whoops, barks and terse shouts. For as long as I could remember, I had expressed myself through soccer, and at 20, I had no sense of self without it.I knew that eighth-hurdle feeling, too, of breaking free. Thirty-four months before watching Jones, during my final high-school soccer game, I outpaced the other team\u2019s defense and surged toward the goal, and for a brief few seconds, everything around me was still, silent. Then the goalkeeper dove for the ball and missed, but took my left knee with him. I didn\u2019t run again for six months.I still harbored what felt to me like modest aspirations: to play professionally, somewhere. So I limped my way onto a college team and busied myself with constructing a redemption story. I fought forward until, eventually, I started negotiating down: If I couldn\u2019t go pro, I would be a college-team starter; if I couldn\u2019t start, I would score; if I couldn\u2019t score, I would at least play. By the end, I bargained down until all I wanted was to return, for one last moment, to that eerie calm, the feeling of striding clear of the surrounding chaos. But I never broke free again, either.I was lucky. I was never close enough to victory to reckon with whether I was actually good enough, and I had an excuse: Whenever someone asked about soccer, I could just point to the scars running along my knee and shrug. But for a brief moment in 2008, yards away from Olympic gold, Lolo Jones was close enough to reckon with the questions that haunt every athlete. Was she good enough? Did she trip, or did she choke?In 2012, she finished fourth in the 100-meter hurdles. Two years after that, she competed in the Sochi Winter Olympics, this time as a bobsledder. Her team finished 11th. It wasn\u2019t until Sochi that I realized Jones had been negotiating down, too: If she couldn\u2019t win an Olympic gold in hurdles, she would win an Olympic medal, period. This year, she tried to prepare for another shot at the hurdles but had to pull out of the Olympic trials in June with a hip injury. Jones says she\u2019ll be back in 2020. She\u2019s bargaining now, as I was. But her moment is past, and I doubt she\u2019ll ever break free again.Greg Howard is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.MELBOURNE, 1956HUNGARY FACES THE U.S.S.R. IN ONE BLOODY WATER-POLO MATCHBy Daniel Duane\u201cYou know, I played against Zador when I was at Cal,\u201d my father liked to say, thinking back to his time at U.C. Berkeley. \u201cHe was an unbelievably dirty player. I always wanted to thank the Russian who punched that bastard.\u201dI first heard the story in 1984, when I was a skinny kid trying to join the popular crowd at Berkeley High School. That crowd revolved around water polo, the most magnificent game that almost nobody cares about. (It rivals football for extreme conditioning, sanctioned violence and technical beauty, but it makes a lousy spectator sport; too much happens underwater.) The team needed a new goalie, and I had long arms, so the popular boys conscripted me. I spent the summer treading water with folding chairs on my head and learning that the phrase \u201cmy father played water polo at Cal\u201d carried a weight in California aquatics culture not unlike the one \u201cmy father played quarterback at Clemson\u201d would carry in the South. My father\u2019s Zador story worked like an anecdote about a collegiate encounter with Peyton Manning.Recently, however, my father decided I should know more. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that Zador business,\u201d he said. \u201cI never actually made varsity, so that must have been a J.V. match. And I remember I had a date that night with a beautiful synchronized swimmer who came to the game, and I was swimming the ball down pool when Zador started pressuring me. I tried to pass the ball to my goalie, but my goalie wasn\u2019t looking, so the ball went into the net.\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d I said, \u201cyou never made varsity?\u201d\u201cOh, Pop.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me Zador ruffled your feathers so bad you scored an own goal in front of your swimmer girl? That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been badmouthing him all these years?\u201dMy father chuckled with embarrassment. \u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was so humiliated that I got completely drunk and, well, there was no second date with that synchronized swimmer.\u201dMy brother-in-law, Mario, offered me a silver lining: \u201cSounds like you ought to thank Zador for your existence.\u201dBut a 2006 documentary called \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fury,\u201d about that famous game, nudged me toward a different interpretation. Zador was Hungary\u2019s enforcer and top-scoring player, arguably the most skilled and physically intimidating player of the era. My father\u2019s encounter with him is best understood by picturing an American J.V. soccer player trying to dribble past Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi and finding himself kicked in the groin, dropped face-first in the mud and somehow guilty of a personal foul that gives Messi a penalty kick to win the game \u2014 a humiliating taste of world-class play and a precious memory nonetheless.Daniel Duane last wrote for the magazine about the rock-climber Alex Honnold.ROME, 1960ABEBE BIKILA RUNS A BAREFOOT MARATHONBy Nitsuh AbebeIt\u2019s hard, these days, for me to picture the Olympics as anything other than a massive and very expensive science experiment, in which a handful of overcompetitive first-world states with spare resources to invest in medal production filter their talented young athletes into research-driven training programs and qualifying competitions, optimizing as many facets as possible of their training, diet, gear, psychology, supplements and elaborate methods of cheating. This isn\u2019t a test of human potential or athletic drive; it\u2019s a test of corporate-organizational prowess, a way for entire nations to play with their citizenry the way kids play with favorite action figures. And this is before we reach the Winter Olympics, where even that challenge falls away and all that\u2019s left is a handful of nations awarding themselves medals for being good at bizarrely specialized feats that most humans on the planet wouldn\u2019t ever have reason to even contemplate trying, let alone building the elaborate tools and tracks and apparatuses involved.Once these uncharitable killjoy thoughts have entered your mind, there are moments when the individual stories of pluck and devotion and odds-overcoming that go into athletes\u2019 Olympic biographies begin to seem almost sad, like imagining one gear in a cuckoo clock having dramatic emotions about its struggle to turn the next one. You start to wonder: Why leave anything to chance? Why not get it over with and choreograph the whole thing as art? Bring on the screenwriters; let them give us an Abebe Bikila for every week of coverage.Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.LOS ANGELES, 1984LIONEL RICHIE OVERSEES the CLOSING CEREMONyBy Wesley MorrisWhat a live entertainer too. There\u2019s nothing pyrotechnic about Richie\u2019s voice, but he was a star in an era when a singer was expected to be able to sing. So it was like a dream watching him belt while strutting around the floor of a darkened L.A. Coliseum, seemingly lit by only his immaculate white pants and the sparkle of sequins on his amazingly tailored jacket. The production got busier as the dancers pooled around him. Soon Richie was just a snarling voice in wide shots of pageantry.It was the first time I saw anybody take that kind of dancing seriously. Here was this city presenting a version of its streets to the world, saying, \u201cThis is who we think we could be.\u201d Any kid who has ever fought with an adult about what good culture is seeks this kind of vindication. Breakdancing isn\u2019t dancing? Well, here, Mr. Adult, is your friend, the former Commodore, Lionel Richie, begging to differ. The production crew could barely keep up with the guys doing head spins and windmills, the ladies doing two-steps. And through it all, Richie looked and sounded time-of-his-life happy to have whipped up this kind of new American chaos. It was a fantasy of a Los Angeles whose multiculti exuberance he made you believe really would play on, play on, play on.Wesley Morris is the critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.By Sam AndersonWhat gives the Olympics its special, precise energy is the tension among all of these orders of time: Everything hinges on a crucial millisecond during the two weeks that we waited for four years (and several millenniums) to see. The Olympics are a global pageant of time swirls, a tiny window that opens, at regular intervals, onto eternity.The face staring out of that window is always the same: Bob Costas. He has presided over the Olympics for so long, nearly 30 years, that he may as well have broadcast the first ceremony from ancient Greece. Although Costas is not particularly athletic-seeming, he has outlasted all the athletes. In his mid-60s, he remains the same boyish, affable elf that he was in the beginning. He is blessed with the American ability to seem perpetually fresh out of the box.In 2014, when a wretched eye infection temporarily knocked Costas out of hosting the Winter Olympics, it felt like seeing George Washington catch a cold and start sneezing on Mount Rushmore. We didn\u2019t know he could do that, didn\u2019t know he had the flesh and glands and fluids. His replacements \u2014 Matt Lauer, Meredith Vieira \u2014 did fine; they are pros. But they didn\u2019t carry the same existential gravitas, the sense of having been flung out of the Big Bang and directly into the host\u2019s chair.In recent months, Costas has spoken of his eventual retirement, of NBC\u2019s succession plan, but it all seems entirely hypothetical, like when astrophysicists talk about the inevitable implosion of the sun: It will happen in a time beyond time, past the reach of mere eons and weeks and milliseconds and years.Sam Anderson is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Night, Another Shooting on Facebook Live", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byThe authorities said the men, ages 27 to 29, came under attack Tuesday evening, as one of them was streaming live video of the group hanging out in a car.Less than six minutes into the broadcast, as the men smoke and listen to the hip-hop of Lil Bibby, gunfire erupts, sending the camera to the floor. With the lens now pointed away from the men, more than 30 pops can be heard over the span of a gut-wrenching 20 seconds.The three men, whom the police declined to identify, were transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. A spokesman for the Norfolk police, Officer Daniel Hudson, said early Wednesday that two of them had improved overnight, but that one remained in critical condition.No information was available on a suspect, Officer Hudson said.A friend of one of the victims, who asked not to be identified because she did not want to upset his family, confirmed that the man holding the camera in the video was T.J. Williams, and the man in the driver seat was Dante Rashad Williams. She did not know the third man seen sitting in the back seat.Friends and family members of the men have been huddling since Tuesday night at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, where they are being treated, she said.Facebook has said its moderators watch videos as they are broadcast and remove those that are \u201cshared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence.\u201d The company\u2019s policy is to allow graphic videos to remain if they condemn or raise awareness of violence.Minutes after the roar of gunfire quieted in Norfolk on Tuesday, a man can be heard on the video comforting the wounded men. \u201cStay with me,\u201d he says repeatedly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201dAs emergency workers treated the victims, they mentioned several wounds \u2014 to the chest, shoulder, right arm and right temple.

{"Headline": "A Killing. A Pointed Gun. And Two Black Lives, Witnessing.", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook\u201cStay with me.\u201dWe\u2019re sadly used to seeing videos of police violence against black citizens: chaotic, abrupt images of a deadly moment. This one, showing a killing\u2019s aftermath, is different \u2014 narrative, personal and terrifyingly intimate.We listen as a woman talks us through her nightmare and tries to talk herself and her daughter out of it alive. In about 10 minutes, it tells a story of race and law enforcement in America, plays out a life-or-death interaction between a black woman and armed police and shows us a little girl\u2019s heartbreaking education.First Ms. Reynolds calmly gives her description of what happened: They were pulled over on Wednesday for a broken taillight in Falcon Heights, Minn.; Mr. Castile told the officer that he had a licensed firearm and reached for his identification, and the officer shot him.When the video begins, Mr. Castile is moving. A minute later, he\u2019s still and slack. She worries that he is already gone.We stay with her.But Ms. Reynolds\u2019s video is still stunning, not simply for its raw images. It takes us inside a moment of private horror and public witness, showing how the ubiquitous technology of video can be empowering yet leave the viewer feeling helpless.There are layers to Ms. Reynolds\u2019s narration. The camera may be a kind of shield; the officer still has his gun drawn, cursing, agitated, and her 4-year-old daughter is in the back seat. Ms. Reynolds is also telling the first draft of the story, calmly.And the calmness is a message in itself.\u201cI told him not to reach for it,\u201d the officer shouts.\u201cYou told him to get his ID, sir,\u201d she says.More officers, guns drawn, tell her to get out of the car and get on her knees. Someone puts the phone on the ground, and you see blue sky and utility wires. You hear the click of handcuffs, sirens, a male voice shouting, cursing. Then a hand picks up the phone, and there\u2019s blackness.But you can still hear. You hear Ms. Reynolds cry out \u2014 \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me my boyfriend\u2019s gone!\u201d \u2014 hear her pray for Mr. Castile\u2019s life, hear her testify for him: \u201cHe\u2019s never been a gang member, anything.\u201d You hear, heartbreakingly, Ms. Reynolds\u2019s daughter tell an officer, \u201cI want to get my mommy\u2019s purse.\u201dThere\u2019s a rustle; there\u2019s light. You see, for a second, the face of the young girl who just watched a man shot to death, staring stoically at you.This is a collection of the viral footage that has prompted a national conversation about race and policing.The video puts you in the moment, but it disembodies you. You are this machine, picked up, dropped down, pulled back out. You are eyes and ears without arms and legs.Watching, by itself, is a kind of paralysis. We can see this thing \u2014 but we\u2019ve seen so many tragedies like it by now, and seeing hasn\u2019t kept them from happening again and again.Witnessing, on the other hand \u2014 as an affirmative act, like Ms. Reynolds\u2019s \u2014 can make a difference. Without video, this kind of shooting might be an item in a local police blotter rather than national news. In the shooting of Mr. Sterling, the police said that the officers\u2019 body cameras had been dislodged, but private-citizen video provided a record, and the Justice Department opened an investigation.Witnessing spurred the Black Lives Matter movement. After the video of Mr. Castile\u2019s shooting appeared, people protested in the streets and gathered online to commiserate and to share advice on how to record encounters with the police.But for all of video\u2019s power to bring us directly into a moment, it can\u2019t help but remind us of the gulf between virtual and physical presence, as Ms. Reynolds\u2019s livecast does in its last wrenching minute.She sits in the back of a police car, handcuffed, with her daughter. She makes her case again: \u201cThe police just shot him for no apparent reason.\u201d She tells any friends watching live that she\u2019s going to need a ride. Finally, she loses her composure and screams.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d we hear her daughter say. \u201cI\u2019m right here with you.\u201dJames Poniewozik is the chief television critic of The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "High-Tech Wagering Sees Gateway Into America: The Horse Track", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 Ever since the first bookie stood on a step ladder and scrawled odds on a chalkboard, betting on horse racing was just about picking winners.No more.Here, where betting on a horse race (or anything at all) is a cherished pastime, you can wager on a horse to lose.You can bet in the middle of a race \u2014 much the way Wall Street traders buy and sell stock based on market fluctuations \u2014 and even cash out a winning ticket before the race is over, if the price is right.This new style of betting, called exchange wagering, was pioneered by Paddy Power Betfair, helping it become the world\u2019s largest publicly traded online gambling company.Exchange wagering has been available since May in New Jersey, where Betfair will sponsor the Haskell Stakes on Sunday at Monmouth Park in Oceanport. It is part of a broader strategy to woo young gamblers comfortable with fast-paced, tech-focused betting and get ahead in what is expected to be the widespread legalization of sports gambling in the United States.Betfair is not the only European bookmaker to target the United States, where momentum for legalizing sports betting is at a high. The bookmaker William Hill, based in London, has become a dominant operator of sports books in Nevada, where betting on games is already legal.But Paddy Power, through its subsidiary Betfair US, has chosen horse racing as its American beachhead and exchange wagering as its lure to draw new customers. Think eBay for gamblers, with wagers being made in real time by traders allowed to post odds and prices for peers to accept or reject.In betting parlance, the over/under is five years on when legalized sports gambling will be available outside Nevada.\u201cThere is no question in my mind we\u2019re going to have this happen,\u201d Tim Wilmott, the chief executive of Penn National Gaming, a company with 27 casinos and racetracks in 17 states, said recently at the East Coast Gaming Congress in Atlantic City.The European incursion has met resistance from American racetrack operators, many of whom are also gambling companies. Two of the biggest, Churchill Downs Inc. and the Stronach Group, fear exchange wagering will cut into their profits. While Churchill operates the Kentucky Derby and the Stronach Group the Preakness Stakes, both have prohibited Betfair\u2019s exchange wagering, citing concerns it will encourage race fixing.\u201cThere are integrity issues,\u201d said Mike Rogers, the president of the racetrack division of the Stronach Group, which owns prestigious tracks in California and Florida. \u201cExchange waging allows a customer to bet a horse to lose, and we are still concerned about the current economics that is being returned to the industry.\u201dBut Betfair is pushing ahead, with its sights on what could be lucrative terrain if sports betting is legalized beyond Nevada.Legislators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and California have already pushed legislation to legalize sports betting in order to increase state revenue. A formal lobbying effort on Capitol Hill for the expansion of legalized wagering by casinos and gambling interests may begin as early as 2017.American professional sports leagues, once among the fiercest opponents, are getting ready for an era in which betting is legal. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said that betting on his league\u2019s games should be legal and regulated.The N.H.L. recently awarded its 31st franchise to Las Vegas, Sin City itself.Some see the rush to embrace gambling as just that, a rush without careful scrutiny.\u201cWe are pretty concerned about the ability of states to adequately address the impacts of legalized and expanded sports betting on problem gamblers and other vulnerable groups,\u201d said Keith S. Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, which as a group remains neutral on legalized gambling. \u201cThey have done a pretty terrible job with most other forms of legalized gambling.\u201dStill, there are signs the public wants to bet on sports. Nearly two-thirds of the population \u2014 63 percent, according to a recent poll by Seton Hall University \u2014 believes that betting on sports should be legal, and 68 percent of the respondents said sports betting\u2019s legality should be decided at the state level.Last year, Nevada sports books took in a record $4.2 billion in legal wagers, a number that is dwarfed by the billions bet illegally through offshore internet sites or operations run by organized crime. Nearly $150 billion is bet illegally by people in the United States, according to estimates by law enforcement and industry groups, a number that easily doubles when illegal wagering globally is factored in.Under a ratio used in Nevada, the American Gaming Association concluded American casinos could increase annual revenue by at least $8 billion if sports betting was extended beyond Nevada.With advanced technologies \u2014 mobile as well as online \u2014 already in place and a record of taking bets at a large scale, William Hill and Betfair have a huge head start on their American competitors.In Betfair\u2019s case, it is almost a turnkey operation. It already owns two television channels that broadcast more than 40,000 races a year and is available in more than 40 million homes in the United States.It also operates an online betting site, TVG, that handles $1 billion annually on horse racing bets in the United States.\u201cThey already got very robust services in place,\u201d said Sebastian Sinclair, president of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a research and consulting firm that specializes in gambling and entertainment. \u201cThey also have gone through the regulatory process in England and Ireland and have passed rigorous examinations. It gives them a leg up.\u201dKip Levin, president of Betfair US, acknowledged that his company is poised to reap a windfall if sports gambling is legalized in the United States. But he added that over the past eight years Betfair has devoted its efforts, as well as tens of millions of dollars, to become the dominant player in an underrated market in the United States: horse racing.Last year, for example, $3.59 billion was bet online legally in the United States on horse racing, generating roughly $700 million in revenue, according to publicly published data from state racing commissions.That total is four times the $158 million in revenue generated by online casinos, and more than double the $300 million in revenue generated by daily fantasy sports, according to numbers compiled by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a financial research firm.\u201cOur focus is, and has been, on growing horse racing through the television stations, our account wagering and now the exchange,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf sports betting becomes legal in the United States, we are ready and in the position to capitalize on it.\u201dBetfair\u2019s pursuit of gamblers in the United States began here from an office in Silicon Docks, where blue chip tech companies like Google, Facebook, Airbnb, LinkedIn and Twitter have taken root. Its interiors are familiar to start-ups the world over, rows of tabletop desks and blinking computer screens in open-air bullpen fashion.The difference is that not only are the ubiquitous television screens tuned to a never-ending stream of horse races, soccer games and almost every conceivable sporting event that can be bet on, but working alongside the engineers and programmers are seasoned bookies. Among them is Gethin Evans, 37, who started with an odds board and money box at English betting rings at racetracks like Ascot and Cheltenham.To Evans, \u201csmart is the new lucky\u201d is more than just the tag line for Betfair\u2019s American advertising campaign. It is the sum of the lessons that he learned assessing risk, crunching data and bringing it to bear for some of Europe\u2019s leading betting operators.He has been paired with Bart Barden, a product manager who previously worked for divisions of Electronic Arts and Microsoft, to spread the gospel of exchange wagering in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have a cutting edge technology,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou got to anticipate how and why your customers want to use it and then give them all the tools they need to feel comfortable. Gambling is about finding an edge or insight and being able capitalize on it.\u201dIn Betfair\u2019s case, the technology is its exchange wagering platform that allows bettors to set and lock in their wagers at their own odds while also offering bettors midrace options.So far 21 tracks in the United States have allowed their races to be part of the Betfair exchange. Among those races will be those run at the Breeders\u2019 Cup World Championships, which include one of America\u2019s most prestigious and lucrative days of racing. Unlike fixed odds books, which are at the mercy of the outcome of the bets, the exchange takes a fee for processing a transaction.In Ireland, for example, Nyquist, the Kentucky Derby champion, is the 6-5 favorite to win the Haskell at fixed-odds sports books. You either take him or leave him at those odds.In the United States, where parimutuel wagering reigns, bettors are pitted against one another. If Nyquist opens at 6-5 and you bet on him, but so does everyone else, the odds might drop to 2-5 and that is what you are stuck with. If Nyquist wins, instead of getting the $4.40 you counted on, the return is only $2.80 for a $2 bet.On the Betfair exchange, however, a wager can be created by a bettor. For instance, the bettor can bet Nyquist will lose, and seek odds of 4-1. So, if any horse in the field upsets the Kentucky Derby champ, the bettor receives $10. The bettor can also hedge that wager by betting on Nyquist to win if, as the race is being run, it is clear that the colt will not be caught.The exchange platform also offers an automated feature called Cash Out that lets a bettor ensure a profit or mitigate a loss with one click of a smartphone or laptop at any time before the race is over. The feature instantly analyzes the bettor\u2019s market position against all other trades being offered by other bettors.So, if a New Jersey gambler takes Nyqvist to win at 7-5 in and the colt is loose on the lead after six furlongs, the Cash Out feature lets the bettor take a smaller profit before Nyqvist hits the wire, whether the colt ultimately prevails or gets caught in the final jump by a closer.The company has countered concerns that the exchange provides a ripe environment for fixing horse races or sporting matches by entering agreements with various leagues and sports organizations around the world to share information on any unusual betting patterns.In Europe, the exchange\u2019s impact has been dizzying as well as lucrative. Last year, Betfair had 1.7 million customers who made about 1.2 billion bets, an average of 3,287,671 bets a day. But the statistic that gets hearts pounding in American horse racing is the average age of customers on the European exchange: 38 compared with 52, the average age of TVG account holders in the United States. Those bettors, however, are wagering on a variety of sports.\u201cIt goes to the heart of what horse racing wants here: new and younger fans,\u201d said Joe Harper, president and chief executive of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.Exchange wagering has been approved in California, but opposition from the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, as well as some prominent owners, has stalled its implementation.\u201cSomething new is not always met with open arms in the horse racing industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why it is so important that exchange wagering becomes a good experience in New Jersey. It can melt away opposition.\u201d\u201cExchanges bring in new demographics precisely because they offer a low vigorish to the most price sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSabotaging this edge sabotages the exchange\u2019s No. 1 selling point.\u201dThe early returns in New Jersey are encouraging, but company officials concede that American bettors face a steep learning curve. In the first seven weeks of operation in New Jersey, exchange wagering on thoroughbreds was $1,142,228, according to the New Jersey Racing Commission.In a typical seven-week period New Jersey handles about twice that number, $2.4 million, online and by phone.\u201cWe seem to be successful so far in attracting people from beyond the traditional tote pools, and liquidity,\u201d said Bart Barden, director of US Exchange, which is part of Betfair US. \u201cBoth of those bode well as we ramp up our marketing efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Whites Sensing Decline, Donald Trump Unleashes Words of Resistance", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byThe chant erupts in a college auditorium in Washington, as admirers of a conservative internet personality shout down a black protester. It echoes around the gym of a central Iowa high school, as white students taunt the Hispanic fans and players of a rival team. It is hollered by a lone motorcyclist, as he tears out of a Kansas gas station after an argument with a Hispanic man and his Muslim friend.TrumpTrumpTrump But in doing so, Mr. Trump has also opened the door to assertions of white identity and resentment in a way not seen so broadly in American culture in over half a century, according to those who track patterns of racial tension and antagonism in American life.Dozens of interviews \u2014 with ardent Trump supporters and curious students, avowed white nationalists, and scholars who study the interplay of race and rhetoric \u2014 suggest that the passions aroused and channeled by Mr. Trump take many forms, from earnest if muddled rebellion to deeper and more elaborate bigotry.On campuses clenched by unforgiving debates over language and inclusion, some students embrace Mr. Trump as a way of rebelling against the intricate rules surrounding privilege and microaggression, and provoking the keepers of those rules.Among older whites unsettled by new Spanish-speaking neighbors, or suspicious of the faith claimed by their country\u2019s most bitter enemies, his name is a call to arms.\u201cI think what we really find troubling is the mainstreaming of these really offensive ideas,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks hate groups. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed some of the worst ideas into the public conversation in ways we haven\u2019t seen anything like in recent memory.\u201dMr. Trump declined to be interviewed for this article, and his spokesman declined to comment.Outside a former aircraft factory in Bethpage, N.Y., not far from a strip of halal butchers and Indian restaurants now known as Little India, a Long Island housewife who gave her name as Kathy Reb finished a cigarette on a spring evening. Nervously, she explained how she had watched the complexion of her suburb outside New York City change. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sticking together in their groups,\u201d she said, \u201cso white people have to, too.\u201dThe resentment among whites feels both old and distinctly of this moment. It is shaped by the reality of demographic change, by a decade and a half of war in the Middle East, and by unease with the newly confident and confrontational activism of young blacks furious over police violence. It is mingled with patriotism, pride, fear and a sense that an America without them at its center is not really America anymore.And Mr. Trump\u2019s rise is shifting the country\u2019s racial discourse just as the millennial generation comes fully of age, more and more distant from the horrors of the Holocaust, or the government-sanctioned racism of Jim Crow.Some are elated by the turn. In making the explicit assertion of white identity and grievance more widespread, Mr. Trump has galvanized the otherwise marginal world of avowed white nationalists and self-described \u201crace realists.\u201d They hail him as a fellow traveler who has driven millions of white Americans toward an intuitive embrace of their ideals: that race should matter as much to white people as it does to everyone else. He has freed Americans, those activists say, to say what they really believe.\u201cThe discussion that white Americans never want to have is this question of identity \u2014 who are we?\u201d said Richard Spencer, 38, a writer and an activist whose Montana-based nonprofit is dedicated to \u201cthe heritage, identity and future of people of European descent\u201d in the United States. \u201cHe is bringing identity politics for white people into the public sphere in a way no one has.\u201dAnother Republican once sounded alarms about globalization, unchecked immigration and the looming obsolescence of European-American culture. But in two bids for the Republican nomination, that candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, won a total of four states. Mr. Trump won 37.Mr. Buchanan\u2019s 1992 and 1996 campaigns were dismissed as a political and intellectual dead end for Republicans.\u201cIt is the changes that are taking place that have created the national constituency for Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said.For many Americans, President Obama\u2019s election, made possible in part by the rising strength of nonwhite voters, signaled a transcendent moment in the country\u2019s knotty racial history. But for some whites, the election of the country\u2019s first black president was also a powerful symbol of their declining pre-eminence in American society.Mr. Tesler used polling questions about the causes and depth of racial inequality \u2014 such as whether blacks suffer greater poverty because of discrimination or lack of effort \u2014 to classify people as either \u201cracial conservatives\u201d or \u201cracial liberals.\u201d During Mr. Obama\u2019s two terms, Mr. Tesler found, racial liberals accelerated their migration to the Democratic Party. As the 2016 campaign began, the Republican Party was not just the party of most white voters. It was also, to use Mr. Tesler\u2019s phrase, the party of racial conservatism.When Mr. Obama ran for re-election, few Americans said they disapproved of him because of his race. But they were comfortable citing his supposed religion. In 2012, according to surveys conducted for the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a majority of Mitt Romney\u2019s voters said Mr. Obama\u2019s religion made them less likely to vote for him. Almost all of these voters believed he was not Christian, an opinion that closely correlated with conservative racial attitudes found in Mr. Tesler\u2019s research.Mr. Trump \u201cis speaking an anti-other message \u2014 that Obama\u2019s foreign, which is mixed in with being black, and perceptions that he is Muslim,\u201d Mr. Tesler said. \u201cIt is a catchall for expressing ethnocentric opposition to Obama, without saying you\u2019re against him because he\u2019s black.\u201dIn June 2015, two weeks after Mr. Trump entered the presidential race, he received an endorsement that would end most campaigns: The Daily Stormer embraced his candidacy.Founded in 2013 by a neo-Nazi named Andrew Anglin, The Daily Stormer is among the most prominent online gathering places for white nationalists and anti-Semites, with sections devoted to \u201cThe Jewish Problem\u201d and \u201cRace War.\u201d Mr. Anglin, 31, explained that although he had some disagreements with him, Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to speak the truth about Mexicans.\u201cTrump is willing to say what most Americans think: It\u2019s time to deport these people,\u201d Mr. Anglin wrote. \u201cHe is also willing to call them out as criminal rapists, murderers and drug dealers.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign electrified the world of white nationalists. They had long been absent from mainstream politics, taking refuge at obscure conferences and in largely anonymous havens online. Most believed that the Republican Party had been subverted and captured by liberal racial dictums.Many in this new generation of nationalists shun the trappings of old-fashioned white supremacy, appropriating the language of multiculturalism to recast themselves as white analogues to La Raza and other civil rights organizations. They call themselves \u201crace realists\u201d or \u201cidentitarians\u201d \u2014 conservatives for whom racial heritage is more important than ideology.But across this spectrum, in Mr. Trump\u2019s descriptions of immigrants as vectors of disease, violent crime and social decay, they heard their own dialect.Mr. Spencer, a popular figure in the white nationalist world, said he did not believe that Mr. Trump subscribed to his entire worldview. But he was struck that Mr. Trump seemed to understand and echo many of his group\u2019s ideas intuitively, and take them to a broader audience.\u201cI don\u2019t think he has thought through this issue in a way that I and a number of people have,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cI think he is reacting to the feeling that he has lost his country.\u201dThis year, for the first time in decades, overt white nationalism re-entered national politics. In Iowa, a new \u201csuper PAC\u201d paid for pro-Trump robocalls featuring Jared Taylor, a self-described race realist, and William Johnson, a white nationalist and the chairman of the American Freedom Party. (\u201cWe don\u2019t need Muslims,\u201d Mr. Taylor urged recipients of the calls. \u201cWe need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump.\u201d) David Duke, the Louisiana lawmaker turned anti-Semitic radio host, encouraged listeners to vote for Mr. Trump.Modern political convention dictates that candidates receiving such embraces instantly and publicly spurn them. In 2008, when it was revealed that a minister who endorsed the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, had made anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim remarks, Mr. McCain forcefully repudiated them.Mr. Trump did something different.Asked about the robocall, Mr. Trump seemed to sympathize with its message while affecting a vague half-distance. \u201cNothing in this country shocks me; I would disavow it, but nothing in this country shocks me,\u201d Mr. Trump told a CNN anchor. \u201cPeople are angry.\u201dPressed, Mr. Trump grew irritable, saying: \u201cHow many times you want me to say it? I said, \u2018I disavow.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump has often used those words when confronted by reporters. The phrase is comfortingly nonspecific, a disavowal of everything and nothing. And whatever Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions, it has been powerfully reassuring to people on the far right.\u201cThere\u2019s no direct object there,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cHe disavowed us,\u201d Mr. Johnson acknowledged, \u201cbut he explained why there is so much anger in America that I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better approach from him.\u201dLike others in his world, Mr. Taylor does not know if Mr. Trump agrees with him on everything. In an interview, he suggested that it did not really matter, and that Mr. Trump was expressing the discomfort many white people felt about other races.\u201cOrdinary white people don\u2019t want the neighborhood to turn Mexican,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, adding, \u201cThey just realize that large numbers of Mexicans will change the neighborhood in ways they don\u2019t like.\u201dAt a Trump rally last month in Richmond, Va., as at most Trump rallies, the audience was mostly white men. They strolled by police barricades in work boots or pressed khakis, grinning at a ragtag assortment of protesters nearby. In interviews, they complained about the Mexican flags brandished outside Trump events and wondered why the government was paying to fix up Section 8 houses for people with late-model iPhones. They recounted Hispanic co-workers mocking them.\u201cThey\u2019ll tell you straight to your face, \u2018This is our country now \u2014 no more gringos!\u2019\u201d said Nick Conrad, a sheet metal worker who wore a \u201cHillary Clinton for Prison\u201d T-shirt and wraparound sunglasses. \u201cThey\u2019re not in it for our culture. They\u2019re not here to assimilate.\u201dMr. Conrad shrugged.\u201cHe says what everyone thinks,\u201d Mr. Conrad said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe says what we\u2019re all thinking. He\u2019s bringing people together. We say, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s right; we can say this.\u2019\u201dAfter Mr. Trump attacked a profile of his wife, Melania, in GQ, the article\u2019s author, the journalist Julia Ioffe, who is Jewish, was inundated with anti-Semitic abuse on social media, including a cartoon depicting Ms. Ioffe in a concentration camp.Asked whether he condemned the attacks, Mr. Trump told an interviewer: \u201cI don\u2019t have a message to the fans. A woman wrote an article that\u2019s inaccurate.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s influence is playing out perhaps most vividly on college campuses, an otherwise deeply liberal redoubt where young people grapple openly and frenetically with their own race and identity.For a generation weaned on a diet of civic multiculturalism, supporting Mr. Trump breaks the ultimate taboo. Students writing Mr. Trump\u2019s name and slogans in chalk have been accused of hate crimes and spurred calls for censorship. And on campuses frozen by unyielding political correctness and expanding definitions of impermissible speech, some welcome the provocation that Mr. Trump provides.Three days after a gunman claiming allegiance to the Islamic State killed 49 people in a gay club in Orlando, Fla., a crowd of college students gathered two blocks from the site of the massacre. They wore Trump hats or T-shirts and chanted, \u201cBuild that wall.\u201d They cracked jokes about trigger warnings or whether the sidewalk counted as a safe space.A few minutes later, a black S.U.V. pulled up, delivering Milo Yiannopoulos, a 30-something gay conservative raised in London and now a minor celebrity among the alt-right.Since 2014, Mr. Yiannopoulos has toured college campuses in the United States and England, staging a performance that is equal parts spectacle and stump speech. Mr. Yiannopoulos dismisses statistics on campus rape as an official fiction and favors the slogan \u201cFeminism is a cancer.\u201dHis barbs are directed chiefly at liberals, feminists and Black Lives Matter activists, all of whom routinely show up to protest or disrupt his speeches. His followers film these confrontations and share them enthusiastically on YouTube and Facebook. In one video, Mr. Yiannopoulos arrives at a speech on a sedan chair carried by several young men wearing Trump hats.\u201cI knew I could have fun on campuses because they are so uptight and they are so ruled by the people I don\u2019t like,\u201d said Mr. Yiannopoulos, who considers himself a \u201cfree-speech fundamentalist.\u201d He added, \u201cLess cynically, they\u2019re an important battleground.\u201dShortly after the shooting, Mr. Yiannopoulos announced plans to speak at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. The university canceled his appearance, first citing a shortage of security personnel and then claiming that no suitable space was available on the 1,415-acre campus. Instead, Mr. Yiannopoulos spoke near the nightclub.He stood just feet from the network television encampments, though none had sent cameras or reporters to cover him. Wearing a dark pinstriped suit under the unrelenting Florida sun, he warned of a gathering menace from Muslim immigrants, sprinkling his speech with anecdotes about sexual assaults in Germany and gender-segregated swimming pools.In Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s telling, liberals were dupes and hypocrites, so blinded by glib multiculturalism that they could not even admit how dangerous Islam was to gay people, like the victims of the Orlando massacre. To cheers and whoops, he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to bar Muslims from entering the country.Afterward, fans lined up to get his autograph. Most seemed to be Trump supporters, but not all were conservative. Several described themselves as socially liberal or libertarian. A few said they just wanted to hear what Mr. Yiannopoulos had to say.\u201cThe setup of U.C.F. has very few places where people are allowed to speak,\u201d said Allen Greathouse, a slender 20-year-old from Melbourne, Fla. \u201cYou can only speak in the free-speech zones.\u201dAnother student, Simon Dickerman, said he was voting for Mr. Trump. He volunteered that he frequently visited 4chan, an online message board where users compete with one another to post ever more provocative content, from Nazi shorthand to racist cartoons.Mr. Dickerman said he understood why such images bothered some older people, though they carried little such charge to him and his friends.\u201cOf course they don\u2019t actually want Jews to die,\u201d Mr. Dickerman said. \u201cThey want to shock.\u201d His peers, he added, \u201care kids who don\u2019t really know about the Holocaust.\u201d\u201cAnd they don\u2019t care about history,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some of them think it\u2019s funny.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Andrew Anglin, founder of The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website. He is 31, not 32.Maggie Haberman and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass Couldn\u2019t Quit Jason Bourne", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byPaul Greengrass couldn\u2019t have been clearer. He was done with Jason Bourne. And that meant his loyal star, Matt Damon, wouldn\u2019t be returning as the covert operative for the C.I.A. who unraveled agency conspiracies while he recovered his memory.\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t expect to ever come back and make another one,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said in an interview last month.The road to yes involved a fragmented political landscape, an insistent fan base and gently prodding studio executives. But the simply titled \u201cJason Bourne\u201d emerges in a moviegoing environment very different from the one the superspy found himself in in 2007.The creative team and studio behind \u201cJason Bourne\u201d hope their film performs more like this year\u2019s few outliers, \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d But they all recognize that the calculus behind successful sequels is tricky.\u201cIt\u2019s this weird thing where you can\u2019t give them exactly the same thing, or they\u2019ll be resentful,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cBut you have to give them enough of something they recognize that they feel like they\u2019re getting what they paid for.\u201dGiven the Bourne franchise\u2019s rocky beginnings, its ultimate success came as a bit of a shock \u2014 even to its star. \u201cThe first movie looked like a turkey within the business,\u201d Mr. Damon said of \u201cThe Bourne Identity.\u201dThat film was delayed and over budget. But something odd happened in the summer of 2002.The movie\u2019s mix of visceral, kinetic action and contemporary political concerns felt fresh to audiences. Jason Bourne was a new kind of action hero. He didn\u2019t punctuate his pummeling of foes with well-aimed quips. And he wasn\u2019t kitted out with the latest technological marvels or a souped-up Aston Martin; he made do with found objects or whatever car he could steal.Though \u201cThe Bourne Identity\u201d performed only decently on its opening weekend \u2014 \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d nearly tripled its box-office take \u2014 word of mouth buoyed the movie, and it ended up making more than $120 million domestically.The studio quickly set out to make more. Mr. Greengrass, coming off \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d his dramatization of a massacre by British troops of Irish protesters in 1972, was recruited for the 2004 \u201cBourne Supremacy.\u201d Critical acclaim joined box-office success for \u201cSupremacy\u201d and, in 2007, \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum,\u201d which won Oscars for film editing, sound mixing and sound editing.But Mr. Greengrass was burned out on Bourne.The films were not only grueling to make, but the original trilogy also felt of a piece, one unfolding story when watched in succession. At the end of \u201cUltimatum,\u201d Jason Bourne remembered everything about his past as a highly trained government assassin and swam off in the East River, having dispatched the corrupt agency officials who had tried to have him killed. A new film would require a new motivating set of circumstances.The studio gave Mr. Greengrass time, and he gave it a shot. But when it became clear that he couldn\u2019t find an idea that excited him, Universal Pictures \u2014 facing a contractual deadline with the Robert Ludlum estate to produce another film \u2014 went to Plan B. Not keen on recasting the role, the studio then released an offering from the screenwriter of the first three films, Tony Gilroy, who conjured up another black ops agent, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) for \u201cThe Bourne Legacy.\u201dBut Donna Langley, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures, never gave up hope. After all, franchise sequels are the lifeblood of today\u2019s movie business.\u201cWe were always playing the long game with the Bourne franchise,\u201d said Ms. Langley, respecting the pair\u2019s decision but believing that a compelling idea might take hold.\u201cEven though Matt and Paul had been very definitive about not wanting to come back, we weren\u2019t really willing to submit to that,\u201d she added with a laugh.In late 2013, Ms. Langley invited Mr. Damon to lunch with her new boss, Jeff Shell, a longtime television executive whom Comcast had just put in charge of Universal\u2019s filmed entertainment business. The get-together had but one purpose: to gently nudge a Bourne movie starring Matt Damon back on track.Mr. Damon was amenable to at least considering a return. Year after year of people coming up to him on the street, in the coffee shop, at the airport, urging him to make another Bourne film, had had its intended effect. And stumbling upon the production offices of \u201cLegacy\u201d while he was in Vancouver filming \u201cElysium\u201d a few years earlier may have contributed as well.\u201cI thought I was completely at peace with the three movies, and I was so happy with how good they were and what the whole franchise had done for my career and my life,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cBut when I saw their production offices, it hurt me in a way that surprised me.\u201dNot long after his meal with the Universal executives, Mr. Damon dined with Mr. Greengrass in Los Angeles. \u201cAt a certain point, I said to Paul, \u2018People really want to see this movie, and that\u2019s not something to turn our noses up at,\u2019\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cHaving made movies that didn\u2019t find an audience, I didn\u2019t want to thumb our nose at this opportunity.\u201dThat resonated with Mr. Greengrass. The ideas began whirring with his longtime creative partner Christopher Rouse, who had edited \u201cSupremacy\u201d and \u201cUltimatum.\u201d And a few weeks later, on a long drive back to his London home, Mr. Greengrass realized: This could actually be fun.Mr. Greengrass, a former journalist, tends to situate his films in recent, real-life events, whether in Iraq after the 2003 American invasion (\u201cThe Green Zone\u201d) or on a cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates (\u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d). And the economic and political aftershocks of the 2008 financial crash that he and Mr. Rouse had been exploring for other projects \u2014 institutions desperately trying to hold onto power amid a wave of angry populist movements \u2014 could find fertile ground in a new \u201cBourne\u201d entry. One of the early action set pieces in \u201cJason Bourne\u201d unspools during an austerity riot in Athens.\u201cAt heart, Bourne is a patriot who\u2019s been betrayed by the institutions he believed in,\u201d Mr. Rouse said. \u201cThose are very identifiable feelings for people today.\u201dSocial media had barely begun when \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201d was released: Facebook was three years old, Twitter just one. Now, it\u2019s a dominant feature of our lives, and Mr. Greengrass wanted to incorporate the privacy-versus-national-security debate the rise of these companies has exacerbated.\u201cThe classic Bourne universe is one where you look at the C.I.A. with great skepticism,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said. \u201cBut I wanted to cast that skeptical eye, Bourne\u2019s skeptical eye, a bit broader. Because the truth is there are other barons in the world now.\u201dThe need for a different world to confront Jason Bourne may be addressed. But a significant slice of the younger moviegoing public may have no clue about the character. And in a summer where more sequels have been rejected than embraced, the audience may view another Bourne movie as just the latest cynical studio project.Mr. Greengrass had that concern in mind when he mapped out Jason Bourne\u2019s first appearance in the film, engaging in a bare-knuckled, bare-chested fight on the Greek-Macedonia border.\u201cIt\u2019s important because it tells you that Bourne is potent, and a physical force to be reckoned with still,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said. (Mr. Damon said he had to get in the best shape of his career, which, he added ruefully, was harder to do at 45 than at 29.) \u201cBut more importantly, it\u2019s proof of our intent, that this is real for us.\u201dEvery movie franchise comes with its own set of audience expectations, and the filmmakers sought to both provide what Mr. Greengrass calls \u201cthe new and the true.\u201d Younger characters are introduced. The fast-cutting, longer-than-typical fight scenes are there but amped up. And Mr. Damon\u2019s Bourne once again finds himself in a possibly deadly car chase, but this time there\u2019s a SWAT truck involved.Asked if the nine-year absence from theaters worries him or the fans beseeching him for an encore were outliers, Mr. Damon began to laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s too late now \u2014 scared money never wins, and I would never have wanted to make the movie worrying about stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still approached it the same way we approached them all: We made the very best movie we could.\u201dMs. Langley at Universal doesn\u2019t betray any doubts about the new movie\u2019s prospects. There are no current plans for a sequel to \u201cThe Bourne Legacy\u201d with Mr. Renner, nor are there designs (as had once been considered) to spin off other characters in other clandestine government operations, she said.\u201cLook, here\u2019s what I think the goal is: to keep Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass doing Bourne movies till they can\u2019t do them anymore,\u201d she said.Lassoing the two men again will require more of Ms. Langley\u2019s horse-whisperer skills. Mr. Damon said that the franchise would need to go off in another direction and that Mr. Greengrass must be involved.Asked if he\u2019d return for another Bourne film, Mr. Greengrass began cackling.\u201cLast time I made the mistake of saying never again, which proved not to be true,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201dWhile he\u2019s been noodling with a new adaptation of \u201c1984,\u201d Mr. Greengrass has not committed to his next project. But he insisted that another Bourne movie would definitely not be it.\u201cI hope the franchise lives on, because I\u2019ve got immense affection for it,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said, but whether he\u2019ll be part of it is an open question. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to think about it for some years.\u201dAn article on July 17 about the return of Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass to the Jason Bourne franchise referred imprecisely to the creation of the first film, \u201cThe Bourne Identity.\u201d While those involved in the making of that film said the production was troubled and marked by battles between the director, Doug Liman, and the studio, Mr. Liman was integral to the version ultimately released. The final cut was not \u201cwrested away\u201d from him.Advertisement"}

Viewership throughout the convention week was about the same as in 2012.In the past four years, many Americans have turned to less traditional means to watch televised events, including YouTube, Facebook and livestreams widely available around the web.But the 2016 race, with its unlikely cast of candidates and dramatic twists, had been attracting record audiences to cable news networks throughout the past year. The 19.8 million viewers who watched the Republican convention on Tuesday, across all the major news networks, was notably less than the 24 million who tuned in for the first Republican primary debate on Fox News last August.In Cleveland, television producers grumbled about the less-than-optimal spectacle put on by the Trump campaign. Relatively unknown speakers appeared in the prime 10 p.m. hour, when the broadcast networks go live, while appealing figures like Senator Jodi Ernst of Iowa were bumped. Strange pauses in the action left anchors scrambling to fill time.\u201cThe underwear model had a better speaking slot than Jodi Ernst,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, the strategist who oversaw Mr. Romney\u2019s convention in 2012, referring to Antonio Sabato Jr.New York executives who flew here for the proceedings were perplexed. Watching delegates stream out of the Quicken Loans Arena one night at 10:30, just as viewership was peaking, one senior network figure asked a producer if the Republicans expected to fill the nation\u2019s living rooms when they could not fill the seats in the hall.After the death of Garry Marshall, the longtime TV producer and film director, was announced late Tuesday during convention coverage, several television executives joked that they ought to cut in with the news, given the sleepy proceedings onstage.Mr. Trump is a keen student of television ratings: During a recent interview, he produced a sheaf of photocopied Nielsen charts for \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d dating to the mid-2000s, and he often calls network executives to discuss the finer points of audience data.At an appearance here on Friday morning, Mr. Trump described his ratings this week as \u201cthrough the roof,\u201d and he wrote on Twitter that the convention was \u201cone of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions.\u201d\u201cBig T.V. ratings!\u201d Mr. Trump added.That was before the actual Nielsen figures were released.

His home, a converted gable-roofed church that once attracted worshipers, had without his knowledge been designated a Pok\u00e9mon \u201cgym,\u201d a place where players who reach Level 5 in the game must go to train their Pok\u00e9mon characters. In the last week, as the game became the most downloaded and top grossing app, he has been wondering how to explain to neighbors all the people who congregated on the sidewalk and pulled up at odd hours.\u201cI want to make sure I tell them, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not a drug dealer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cI know there are people pulling up in front of the house all the time, but trust me I have no say in this.\u201dIn the case of Pok\u00e9mon Go, players traverse the physical world following a digital map, searching for cartoon creatures that surface at random. People look through their smartphone cameras to find Pok\u00e9mon. When an animated creature appears, they toss Pok\u00e9balls at it until it is subdued.But Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s public nature is also causing unforeseen side effects, attracting crowds that disturb homeowners and creating opportunities for criminals to lure players to remote areas where they can be targeted for theft. In Australia, police have issued tips for how roving Pok\u00e9mon Go players can safely play the game.Many technology companies thought A.R. might first take off through specialized business applications that, for example, allow architects to visualize finished building projects in situ. Instead, it took a game based on a beloved entertainment franchise from the mid-1990s in Japan to help the technology go mainstream.Pok\u00e9mon, a hybrid of the words \u201cpocket\u201d and \u201cmonsters,\u201d belongs to the Pok\u00e9mon Company, which is partly owned by Nintendo, the Japanese game pioneer, which has struggled to adapt to the era of gaming on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In the cartoon, Pok\u00e9mon trainers use characters to battle each other for sport. The uptake of Pok\u00e9mon Go, which is so far available only in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, has been so furious that it sent Nintendo\u2019s market capitalization soaring $9 billion in the last few days.Niantic partnered with the Pok\u00e9mon Company to make Pok\u00e9mon Go. Mr. Hanke said he didn\u2019t have exact numbers of Pok\u00e9mon Go players, but that it was safe to say it will be \u201cquite a bit beyond\u201d the number of players Ingress has attracted. Downloads of Pok\u00e9mon Go have been so frequent that Niantic\u2019s servers had trouble handling the traffic and the company is struggling to add additional capacity. Mr. Hanke said Niantic was delaying the game\u2019s introduction in additional countries for a few days so it could handle the demand.\u201cWe expected it to be popular, but we didn\u2019t expect it to be like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting our feet underneath us.\u201dLike the most successful mobile games, while Pok\u00e9mon Go is free to play, it gives players opportunities to buy virtual items for a few dollars to speed up their progress. The game\u2019s real-world nature also gives Niantic another intriguing moneymaking possibility, by charging fast-food restaurants, coffee shops and other retail establishments to become sponsored locations where people are motivated to go to pick up virtual loot.Niantic has cut deals like that for Ingress, and Mr. Hanke said the company would announce sponsored locations for Pok\u00e9mon Go in the future.Nintendo referred questions to a Pok\u00e9mon Company representative, who declined to comment on Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s popularity.Jan Dawson, a technology analyst at Jackdaw Research, said Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s success was an important moment for augmented reality, mainly because it doesn\u2019t require expensive extra equipment like a headset, which virtual reality games often need.\u201cThis clearly demonstrates that A.R. can cross over into the mainstream on the devices people already have in at least some cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily do anything for the kind of A.R. and V.R. experiences big companies are piling so much money into.\u201dFor players, Pok\u00e9mon Go has been a health booster and a social cementer. Kay Collins, a 22-year-old health care worker in San Francisco, played the game for half a day straight on Sunday, including while waiting in line at a tattoo parlor.\u201cMy pedometer says I\u2019ve taken way, way more steps throughout the day than I used to before I started playing this game,\u201d she said, adding that it had helped her explore her neighborhood.Brad Ensworth, a San Francisco State University student who played the game over the weekend, said he had never been a fan of augmented reality gaming before Pok\u00e9mon Go, but was drawn in by the game\u2019s surprisingly social aspect.\u201cYou\u2019ll just run into people and spark up conversations immediately,\u201d he said while playing the game in Golden Gate Park. \u201cWe met this one guy who drove up from San Jose to collect Pok\u00e9mon in the park, and he had more knowledge about this game than anyone else we\u2019ve met so far. We called him the Guru.\u201dPok\u00e9mon Go mass gatherings are also on the horizon. Sara Witsch, a theater studies major at San Francisco State University, organized a Facebook group for a \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go crawl\u201d that is tentatively scheduled for July 20. As of Monday evening, more than 18,000 people had indicated they were interested in attending, and more than 3,700 confirmed that they would be there.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a town where a bar was offering a discount to Pok\u00e9mon Go players.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Photography was still in its early years when the 20-year-old Alsatian-born Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Auguste Bartholdi traveled to Egypt with a box camera. He returned with calotypes and, more important, a fascination with the monumental architecture of antiquity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 undoubtedly planting the seeds for the gigantism of his own designs for the Statue of Liberty. Although he soon sidelined photography in favor of painting and sculpture, it\u2019s a medium whose visionary possibilities he recognized in the the early stages of its development. This was the era of public works: In France, Napoleon III used monuments in his reign through 1870 to create a sense of national unity and glory. Bartholdi built his first statue at age 22 (G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Rapp, inaugurated in his hometown, Colmar); later, his Lion de Belfort caused a stir for its proportions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 11 meters high and 22 meters wide, or 36 feet by 72 feet. But his Statue of Liberty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Liberty Enlightening the World \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is Bartholdi\u2019s magnum opus. The project was conceived as a gesture to seal Franco-American friendship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 French support during the American Revolution had solidified relations. Moreover, it was seen as a symbolic celebration of a hundred years of United States democracy. And photography played a crucial role in making Lady Liberty a reality. Bartholdi hired photographers to document its creation, and those images raised money and awareness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe entire promotional phase and diffusion of images of the Statue of Liberty is through photography \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because Bartholdi had a lot of trouble financing the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sam Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9, the director of the Rencontres d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Arles photography festival, where many of these images are on display. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was constantly looking for funds, and he got them by what could be considered the first merchandising campaigns.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf anything, Bartholdi was his own master of hype, said Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9, noting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe image of the Statue of Liberty circulated well before the statue itself was inaugurated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore the centennial of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s independence in 1876, Bartholdi took a trip across the United States. Along the way, he acquired a panorama of New York Harbor, which he amended with gouache, directly painting the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Island \u00e2\u0080\u0094 now known as Liberty Island \u00e2\u0080\u0094 off Manhattan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip.The statue was built in Paris, in an atelier in the 17th Arrondissement to ensure its solidity and durability. Its full 46 meters, or 150 feet, loomed above the local Haussmannian buildings. For each section, a wooden skeleton was covered with plaster and copper sheets were hand-hammered on it to contour the statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outermost layer. The architect and restorer Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Viollet-le-Duc advised on internal functionality; when he died, Gustave Eiffel and his team took over. Though Bartholdi no longer practiced photography, he clearly grasped the medium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance: He hired professionals to record the progress of his gargantuan, utopian project. The purpose of the images was utilitarian, but the photographers, among them Pierre Petit and Charles Marville, shaped the aesthetics of 19th-century photography.The show is chronological to illustrate the deliberate process, with Bartholdi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos from Egypt as the starting point. Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 and his co-curator, Luce Lebart, curator at the French Society of Photography, selected 100 archival images for their aesthetic and informational value. The Statue of Liberty took Bartholdi 15 years to complete, from 1870 to 1885, a decade longer than anticipated. During the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 centennial of independence, only the statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand holding the torch was ready. This part was independently lent to the first American World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fair in Philadelphia in 1876, where visitors paid to climb the 10-meter-high hand, and stand before the flame.Entrepreneurial savvy was crucial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven during the building process, paid public atelier visits were possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmall souvenirs were marketed, including photos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was unveiled at the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris. Visitors paid to climb inside and look out through the crown over the city \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then mark this moment of wonder by buying keepsakes.Bartholdi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cunning use of photography was unprecedented, because when he started construction in the 1870s, the medium was only 30 years old. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a new art form, not terribly easy to handle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was not the first attempt at using photography for documentation, it was the first that was as complete and systematic for a work of that import.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After endless delays with the statue, further fiscal problems plagued construction of the massive pedestal on which it would stand, which the Americans were tasked with building. The statue and pedestal were so overdue, the press published drawings of the Statue of Liberty as an old lady, a taunt about how she would look by the time the whole project was completed. Dismantled into 350 pieces, the statue was transported to New York from the port of Le Havre. When it finally reached the other side of the Atlantic, it was rebuilt over four months and inaugurated on Oct. 28, 1886, with a parade on Broadway. Its awe-inspiring scale was to match the modernity of its egalitarian ideals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet, no women, blacks or Jews were invited to the statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication.Surprisingly, the Statue of Liberty wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t initially intended for New York. It was meant for the opening of the Suez Canal, as a beacon for boats. Bartholdi had presented a model to the canal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developer, Ferdinand de Lesseps, and to the Khedive of Egypt, Isma\u00e2\u0080\u0099il Pasha, in 1869, but the idea was rejected. In Bartholdi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first version, the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was covered, to reference the attire of Middle Eastern peasant women. Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 mused, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo think that 130 years ago, the Statue of Liberty could have been at the opening of the Suez Canal, showcasing a veiled version of Liberty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Liberty\u00e2\u0080\u009d is on view at the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e D\u00c3\u00a9partemental Arles Antique in Arles, France, through Sept. 11."}
{"Headline": "When Everyone Can Be \u2018Queer,\u2019 Is Anyone?", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThe speed with which modern society has adapted to accommodate the world\u2019s vast spectrum of gender and sexual identities may be the most important cultural metamorphosis of our time. Facebook, which can be seen as a kind of social census, now offers nearly 60 different gender options, including \u201cquestioning\u201d and \u201cbigender\u201d \u2014 or no gender at all. In a new commercial for Calvin Klein, Young Thug, a slender rapper prone to wearing dresses, states that he feels \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as gender.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recently added Mx, a neutral replacement for titles like Mr. and Mrs. The video game \u201cThe Sims\u201d has even begun allowing players to create same-sex relationships and lifted gender restrictions on characters\u2019 clothing and hairstyles. Plainly, we are in the midst of a profoundly exhilarating revolution. And \u201cqueer\u201d has come to serve as a linguistic catchall for this broadening spectrum of identities, so much so that people who consider themselves straight, but reject heteronormativity, might even call themselves queer. But when everyone can be queer, is anyone?The word became linked to sexual behavior in the early 1900s, as a derogatory term for men deemed effeminate and others who upended traditional gender roles and appearances. As homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and made punishable by law, the word snowballed into a full-blown slur, heard everywhere from the playground (\u201csmear the queer\u201d) to intellectual duels (William F. Buckley Jr. to Gore Vidal: \u201cNow listen, you queer\u201d).This halo of negativity began to dim somewhat in the 1970s, when the word was reclaimed by activists and academics. Not only did its deliberate looseness make it a welcome alternative to the rigidity of \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian,\u201d it also turned the alienating force of the slur into a point of pride. (Though it is still considered offensive by some.) A manifesto distributed at New York City\u2019s Pride parade in 1990 by Queer Nation, a prominent and controversial gay-rights group, put it this way: \u201cWhen a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning, we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we\u2019ve chosen to call ourselves queer. Using \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world.\u201d It was a radical word for a radical time. Protesters and advocacy groups \u2014 particularly communities of color \u2014 took it up to gather support for the fight against the AIDS crisis and for gay rights. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, get used to it\u201d became a popular chant.Academics saw queerness as possessing revolutionary potential. Eve Sedgwick, a professor at Duke who is considered one of the founders of queer theory, described queerness as an \u201copen mesh of possibilities.\u201d David Halperin, a founder of an academic journal on queer studies, describes queerness as a practice, one that is an \u201cexhilarating personal experiment, performed on ourselves by ourselves.\u201d Writing in 1995, Halperin bemoaned the dilution of what he felt was a subversive word. \u201cThere is now a right way to be queer ... to invert the norms of straight society,\u201d he scoffed, referring to clothes, haircuts, piercings, even diets tailored to gay and lesbian buyers. \u201cHow can queer modes of consumption count as resistant cultural practices?\u201d Eight years later, the hit makeover show \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d debuted on Bravo, literalizing Halperin\u2019s concerns. Each episode culminated in a lavish shopping trip that distilled gay culture down to clothes and hair products \u2014 and it was all done in the service of straight men.Increased acceptance of queerness has only led to increased commodification. Every June, the month of most gay-pride celebrations, companies like Netflix, McDonald\u2019s, Apple, Salesforce and Walmart spend tremendous amounts of money to include their branded floats in the parades. This year, Andrew Joliv\u00e9tte, a professor at San Francisco State University, told The Guardian that the city\u2019s event was no longer a symbol of progress. Instead, he said, it felt like a prolonged commercial: \u201cGay Inc.\u201d In the same article, Isa Noyola, a transgender Latina activist in San Francisco, remarked on the paradox that the same companies championing gay rights have contributed to the gentrification that has made the Castro one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic to walk alongside tech companies that have displaced us,\u201d she said.The radical power of \u201cqueer\u201d always came from its inclusivity. But that inclusivity offers a false promise of equality that does not translate to the lived reality of most queer people. Anti-trans bathroom laws and the shooting at Pulse, the gay nightclub in Orlando, are the latest reminders that equality has yet to arrive. Seen this way, such a sunny outlook can, in fact, be counterproductive. DarkMatter, a South Asian trans performance-art duo, highlights this observation \u2014 the way visibility and acceptance can actually lead to erasure \u2014 in their works. In one, called \u201cRainbows Are Just Refracted White Light,\u201d they intone, \u201cRainbows are just a trick of light, they make us forget the storm is still happening.\u201dMaybe we are relying on a single word, a single idea, a single identity, to do too much. After all, \u201cqueer\u201d never belonged to us; it was foisted upon us, and we reconfigured it to make it ours. The future will bring new possibilities and ideas \u2014 and new terms for them. Scientists are still learning about the vast and complex components that interact to create human sexuality. An article in Nature from 2015 delved into the latest research on sex and gender among mice. Sex determination is thought to happen in the womb, but studies of mice suggest that sex can fluctuate between male and female throughout life. Someday, maybe we\u2019ll recognize that queer is actually the norm, and the notion of static sexual identities will be seen as austere and reductive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter, Grappling with Anemic Growth, Tries to Bolster Its Advertising Business", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a description that is also applicable to Twitter.Not so for Twitter. For months, the San Francisco-based company has been grappling with worsening advertising growth and anemic audience growth. It risks losing out on top talent and deals to other bigger, stronger companies.Twitter posted revenue of $602 million for the quarter, up 20 percent from a year ago and below Wall Street estimates of $607 million. Its net loss narrowed to $107 million, or 15 cents a share. Twitter\u2019s users grew 3 percent from a year ago, to 313 million.Looking ahead, the company projected revenue of $590 million to $610 million for the current quarter, far below analyst estimates of $681 million.Still, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, struck an upbeat note.\u201cAs C.E.O., I\u2019ve seen a lot of the benefit of our focus and execution over the past year,\u201d he said in a conference call with investors on Tuesday.At the heart of the problem is that the 10-year-old company is still struggling with how to make its product appealing to an audience on a larger scale. Part of the challenge has been direct comparisons to Facebook, which lures more than 1.65 billion monthly visitors to its site.For a time, Twitter was able to sidestep concerns about its ability to add new users because of the strength of its advertising business; revenue was growing in the high double-digit figures.That has changed. Over the last six months, Twitter has experienced slower growth in advertiser demand, spooking investors and causing its stock to plummet.Twitter\u2019s inability to attract new users caught up to it, analysts said, causing a stagnation in advertiser demand. As Twitter is less able to increase the size of its user base, advertisers are more likely to buy ads on Facebook, which has a huge global reach, or perhaps Snapchat, which caters largely to younger audiences.\u201cIt all goes back to the company focusing on building a ubiquitous product and failing to deliver on that promise,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.To turn itself around, Twitter has bet on live streaming video. The company has struck agreements with the National Football League, Bloomberg and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, among others, to live stream events. Twitter will also try to sell more costly ads \u2014 namely video ads, which carry a much higher premium \u2014 to its existing advertiser base.\u201cWe\u2019ve become a video-centric platform,\u201d Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in the company\u2019s conference call on Tuesday. \u201cIt is now the No. 1 ad format in terms of revenue on Twitter.\u201dThe company is also working on bolstering what is called direct response advertising, which prompts users to take an action like downloading a mobile app or signing up for a newsletter. The effectiveness of those ads, Twitter said, is easier to measure, which could provide repeat business. While such ads are currently a small portion of the company\u2019s overall advertising revenue, Twitter hopes to increase it over time, said Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer.\u201cWe\u2019re focused now on what matters most, and what we need to fix,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A South Korean Copy of Snapchat Takes Off in Asia", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 It sends short, self-destructing messages. It has a place to share videos called stories. It has camera filters that transform a person into a koala, a fried egg, a police officer or any number of foods, animals and figures.But this is not Snapchat. This is Snow, a popular South Korean Snapchat clone that shows how even the most popular American smartphone apps face an uphill battle in fast-growing Asian countries.Snow focuses on Asian consumers. Like Snapchat, it offers users an array of filters that can add dog ears, glowing eyes and bulbous foreheads to selfies. But Snow also lets users add bottles of soju, the Korean liquor, or images of Korean pop stars. Another filter adds a rain of fried chicken, a favorite South Korean nosh. For Japan there are sumo wrestler and sushi filters.As a result, a significant part of Snow\u2019s roughly 30 million downloads have been from Asia since the app\u2019s September introduction, according to Han Dong-keun, a spokesman for its parent, the South Korean internet company Naver. Notably, it is also gaining traction in China, where the country\u2019s 700 million users make up the world\u2019s largest internet market. There, Snow has a major advantage: Snapchat is blocked in China.\u201cWe usually use Snow when drinking tea together or eating a meal together to take pictures together, because the app is really truly interesting,\u201d said Sun Yuying, a Shanghai university student who said she discovered Snow a month ago when she saw on social media that a number of Chinese celebrities were using it. \u201cSometimes when it\u2019s a friend\u2019s birthday or you have to send some congratulatory message, you can make a short Snow video or image and send it to the other person.\u201dSnow\u2019s popularity in Asia underscores a new reality for American app makers. Previously, popularity in the United States often led to corresponding growth overseas. Today, well-established internet firms in Japan, South Korea and China can move quickly into those niches.For Snapchat, the biggest social network success out of America in recent years, the success of Snow shows that any original advantage it may have had in East Asia\u2019s vast and lucrative markets is fading.\u201cA lot of start-ups are thinking if they build a product, they\u2019ll be able to go global, but that\u2019s just not the case anymore,\u201d said Tim Chae, a partner at 500 Startups, who heads a venture capital fund focused on Korean start-ups.Snapchat did not respond to requests for comment. Snapchat does not list any Asian offices on its website but is advertising for freelancers working remotely to help it develop local-language versions in South Korea and Japan as part of a \u201clanguage ambassador program.\u201dMr. Han, the spokesman for Snow, acknowledged it was similar to Snapchat, but said Snow had unique features like video chat. Like Snapchat, its primary user demographic is teenagers and young adults.East Asian countries have provided a ready market for new social networks centered on video, selfies, animations and entertainment. The new social networks are largely used on smartphones \u2014 a transition that established social networks like Facebook are trying to make. Japan has Line, which like Snow is owned by Naver. China has WeChat, a messaging and social media app that has become nearly ubiquitous on Chinese smartphones.Ivy Zhou, another Chinese Snow user, attends university in Hong Kong, which does not have China\u2019s internet censorship and where she is free to use Snapchat. Snapchat\u2019s social network is far more vibrant than Snow\u2019s, she said, but in China, Snow could fill a fun niche.\u201cIn mainland China, because they can\u2019t use Snapchat, I\u2019m sure people will use Snow more,\u201d she said.\u201cWhereas WeChat is really a communication tool, Snow has a lot more of an entertainment element, and more young people use it,\u201d she saidSnow\u2019s initial success could offer a road map for Asian social media networks, many of which have struggled to break out of their home markets. While South Korea boasts a mobile and tech-savvy market, its internet companies suffer from doing business in a relatively small market.Even Line, Naver\u2019s biggest international success, with a major presence in Japan and Thailand, has ultimately seen its success fall short of other chat apps like WeChat or Snapchat, in part because it does not have a large home market.Naver still has plans to bring Line to United States, according to the company, but Mr. Chae, the venture capital investor, said Korean companies were now looking at China instead.\u201cFor the longest time, the holy grail for a lot of Korean founders was to get U.S. market share,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all failed, and failed because there were so many issues. There was no American working culture, they didn\u2019t have a network in America, they didn\u2019t speak English.\u201d\u201cWith the rise of China and China\u2019s infatuation with Korean culture, it\u2019s breathed new life into Korean start-ups and founders,\u201d Mr. Chae said. \u201cThis is a market that happens to be a lot bigger than the U.S., that seems to be more welcoming for Korean technology and culture than the Western world ever was.\u201dEmily Feng in Beijing and Choe Sang-Hun in Seoul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s never been in government. His business career includes a string of bankrupt casinos, unpaid bills from small businesses, a smarmy \u201cuniversity\u201d and a rather troubled Scottish golf course. But Donald Trump has always been a guy who knew how to slather on some glitz.Trump said he was planning a \u201cwinners\u2019 evening\u201d with supporters like New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady, who promptly said he wasn\u2019t coming. (Although Brady, who has been banned from playing the first part of the next season would seem to have a lot of time on his hands.) Trump made a similar announcement about the Steelers\u2019 quarterback, with similar results.Even Tim Tebow, former college star turned failed professional football player turned inspirational speaker, is going to be a no-show. The Trump campaign said he was on the program. Then Tebow, who now runs a charitable foundation, posted an Instagram video bemoaning \u201crumors.\u201dOf course, none of us actually cares there aren\u2019t going to be any quarterbacks at the Republican convention. But if Trump can\u2019t negotiate some cheesy diversions, what makes anybody think he can negotiate a new trade deal with China?And by the way, were you curious about why Sarah Palin wasn\u2019t coming to the convention? Easy answer. The Republican Party\u2019s presumed presidential nominee says it\u2019s because Alaska is too far from Cleveland.Saying made-up things is a Trump stock in trade. Many of his fans defend his crazy statements about Muslims or Mexican walls or trade wars with a wave of the hand and a \u201cyou know he doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d But we are getting into Twilight Zone territory here. There\u2019s really no real.The convention comes after a week in which we watched the drama of Trump\u2019s vice-presidential selection. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was the lucky winner. Pence is a social conservative who hews to the Paul Ryan vision of government \u2014 low taxes on the rich, free trade and a trimming of the Social Security safety net.Big relief to the powers that be. But what about all those underemployed, alienated white workers who are expecting an anti-establishment, populist savior?I dunno. Go ask Tom Brady.The process by which Trump got to Pence was sort of stunning \u2014 several days of familial gatherings, muddied decision-making and an overweening sense that the Big Guy himself just couldn\u2019t nail the decision down.It should have been simple, and it was a monumental screw-up. Obviously, Trump\u2019s not the only candidate who makes mistakes. We\u2019ll be hearing a lot about Hillary and her emails. The difference is that Clinton, like most people at the highest level in the American political system, can balance her disasters with a history of achievements. Trump has, um, Mar-a-Lago.Based on the evidence we\u2019ve seen so far, try to envision President Trump handling a crisis of major proportions. Pretend Wyoming is lifted into a giant spaceship by aliens who demand to speak with our leader.1. Trump, who is off inspecting a new golf course in Sri Lanka, tweets that he\u2019s sending his top celebrity endorser, Wayne Newton.2. Newton says no via Facebook.3. Cabinet meets and votes to send Mike Pence.4. The president\u2019s inner circle \u2014 Trump\u2019s oldest daughter, two oldest sons, a son-in-law and 10-year-old Barron, who knows the most about the construction of spacecraft \u2014 hold an emergency meeting. The White House chief of staff is summoned from the basement and dispatched to fire the cabinet.5. Space aliens take Montana, too.6. After several days of conflicting reports, a new cabinet is formed with a mandate to build a dome over the remaining Plains states. President goes on TV and promises \u201ca really, really big dome.\u201d7. Flags are reconfigured with the new national motto: \u201cForty-eight is great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ve been plowing through stacks of them to make your life simpler. Here are some of my favorites.This is a tell-all of Mr. Martinez\u2019s experience in venture capital and later at Facebook, filled with insights about Silicon Valley \u2014 what he calls \u201cthe tech whorehouse\u201d \u2014 mixed with score-settling anecdotes that will occasionally make you laugh out loud. Clearly there will be people who hate this book \u2014 which is probably one of the things that makes it such a great read.The dedication page includes this gem: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d Mr. Martinez is particularly incisive when it comes to illustrating how failed ideas that happen to work are often spun into great successes: \u201cWhat was an improbable bonanza at the hands of the flailing half-blind becomes the inevitable coup of the assured visionary,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe world crowns you a genius, and you start acting like one.\u201dThe biggest surprise for me was that the most successful entrepreneurs didn\u2019t quit their day jobs to pursue their ideas; instead, they stayed at work until they had worked all the kinks out of their plans and gotten them off the ground. The other head-scratcher in this book? Procrastination is a great thing. (This was a terrific revelation.)The book is peppered with stories about the likes of Michael Milken, Bruce Wasserstein, Felix Rohatyn and Martin Lipton \u2014 a cast of characters who defined an age that irrevocably shaped corporate America today. But more than any book I\u2019ve read, Mr. Teitelman\u2019s has managed to capture how power shifted from a company\u2019s boardroom to its shareholders, a change that is often seen as positive but clearly comes with its own pitfalls.\u201cSo profound has been that revolution that memories of an earlier corporate identity \u2014 the patriarchal company managed for the stakeholders, the Platonic corporation \u2014 have grown dim, as if it had never existed,\u201d Mr. Teitelman writes.Mr. Gramm has collected a series of deliciously rich letters, many of which were never before published, sent to chief executives by investors by everyone from Warren Buffett to Ross Perot. They are eye-opening, often chilling and include fascinating lessons about business.My personal favorite is this letter from Mr. Loeb to the chief executive of Star Gas Partners: \u201cIt seems that Star Gas can only serve as your personal \u2018honey pot\u2019 from which to extract salary for yourself and family members, fees for your cronies and to insulate you from the numerous lawsuits that you personally face due to your prior alleged fabrications, misstatements and broken promises. I have known you personally for many years and thus what I am about to say may seem harsh, but is said with some authority. It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites. The matter of repairing the mess you have created should be left to professional management and those that have an economic stake in the outcome.\u201dMr. Greenspan is a fascinating subject because for so long he was considered a genius, only to later be blamed for the financial crisis. Mr. Mallaby does an exquisite job going beyond these two versions of the Greenspan narrative and taking the reader inside the complicated mind of a man who may have had one of the largest ever influences over our economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thumbelina\u2019s Secret Architect, Creating Fairy Houses on a New Jersey Trail", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosThey were delicate creations made largely of the natural materials one might find in the woods: a chair seat made of an acorn, a ladder of twigs, a seat back fashioned from a fungus fan, a sofa cushioned with moss.And they mainly dotted a part of the Rahway Trail in Locust Grove, a short walk from downtown Millburn that draws dog walkers and runners from the surrounding towns.There were 20 to 30 of them, new ones replacing old ones over the years, discreetly tucked in a tree hollow or artfully incorporated into a root. They all had a similar enchanting style and looked like the work of one person, but nobody seemed to know exactly who.\u201cIt was like a treasure hunt to find them and exciting and lovely,\u201d said Gail Waimon, a member of the South Mountain Conservancy, a volunteer group that maintains and leads hikes through the 2,110-acre nature reserve in Essex County.\u201cBut this year I noticed the houses multiplying by leaps and bounds,\u201d she said.In the spring, a new breed of fairy house started popping up along the same trail. They were crude by comparison: plastic toy houses with leaves stuck to the top; ready-made, paint-your-own wooden doll furniture, like one might find in a craft store; and even, in one case, a whiteboard with the words \u201cFairy House.\u201dSome were tastefully set back from the path, the way the originals had been, but others were plopped right at the trail\u2019s edge. They were a mishmash of styles. Some replicated the look of the original homes. Others looked like the work of children, painted garish unwoods-like colors and housing plastic toys like green army men.\u201cSome of them were getting a little tacky,\u201d Dennis Percher, the chairman of the conservancy\u2019s board of trustees, said. \u201cThey had Smurfs and stuff.\u201dRegular visitors to the woods were not pleased. And apparently neither was the mystery architect of the original fairy homes who, in response, etched a sign on a sheaf of wood and tucked it into a tree stump \u2014 \u201cFairies Like: Acorns, pine cones, shells, flowers and pretty stones. Not plastic.\u201dThe elfin ordinance, however, did not quell a rash of new construction.A steady flow of parents and their children and small Girl Scout groups started arriving at the reservation to hunt for the fairy homes, having heard about them from parenting blogs and the local news media. A few left behind their own creations.\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to make the kids creative,\u201d said Laura Chang of Madison, N.J., who brought her three children and the family dog for a shaded outing on a recent hot summer morning. \u201cIt sparks their imagination. It\u2019s something magical.\u201dMr. Percher and others in the conservancy were torn. They did not like the new creations, which violated the \u201ctake nothing, leave nothing\u201d spirit of the outdoors.Some conservancy members were reluctant to impose their own aesthetic, because, after all, who is to say what a fairy house is and is not, they reasoned. And anything that gets children into the woods must be a good thing, they thought.But the group objected to another development: the lime-green X marks and arrows that someone had painted on tree trunks, marking the fairy trail.So in June the conservancy posted its own sign at the trailhead: \u201cPlease follow the Fairy House rules! Natural materials only. No plastic or glass. Do NOT paint trees.\u201dThe group hoped the sign would encourage fairy enthusiasts to preserve the original work by the mystery person, someone a few members thought they had once met.A woman, some years ago, had identified herself to a couple of conservancy members as they worked at a table at an environmental event.\u201cShe was short and elfin like with a round friendly face,\u201d said John Verzani, a math professor at the College of Staten Island and a vice chairman of the conservancy.Indeed, the woman was the architect of the original fairy houses. Therese Ojibway, a 60-year-old special education teacher, chuckled at Mr. Verzani\u2019s description of her.Ms. Ojibway took to the woods years ago when her son, Clinton, who is now 25, was 3. He has autism, and the nature reserve has been a place of freedom for him and a retreat for her.Five years ago she started building the fairy houses, drawing upon a childhood she said was rich in fairy-tale lore and stories like \u201cThumbelina\u201d by Hans Christian Andersen, \u201cThe Borrowers\u201d by Mary Norton and the Flower Fairies, illustrations by Cicely Mary Barker.Ms. Ojibway said she was also influenced by the fairy homes on Monhegan Island in Maine.\u201cI started looking at the hollows of the trees and thought, \u2018If I were a fairy I would live there,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Ojibway says she loves that children have been inspired by her work to make their own creations.Children occasionally leave notes with instructions for the fairies, which Ms. Ojibway sometimes acts on. One child left a shell for her to make into a bed, which she did. Others have left their baby teeth for the tooth fairy.She does upkeep on her little houses about once a week, usually in the evenings with her son, and also removes some of the unsightly fairy houses.She avoids people as she works, but over the years she said she has occasionally been caught in the act and would explain that she was helping the fairies.Recently, Ms. Ojibway replaced some of the delicate wooden fairy doors with hardier ones, which she painted to hide the scratch marks caused by middle schoolers who she believes have vandalized her work.\u201cThere are some terrible hooligans in the woods,\u201d she said, adding that some of the fairy furniture occasionally gets stolen.Ms. Ojibway said she was also behind the anonymous Facebook group, which she started a few years ago. And she said she was also the person who painted the green marks on the trees \u2014 fairy wings, she said, to direct children.\u201cYeah, that was me,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to admit it because I think the conservancy got mad at that.\u201dAn article on Monday about the creation of little fairy houses in the woods of South Mountain Reservation in Millburn, N.J., misspelled the name of the place in Maine whose fairy homes helped influence Therese Ojibway to make similar creations in New Jersey. It is Monhegan Island, not Monehegan Island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Day 1", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementCLEVELAND \u2014 The theme of the evening was \u201cMake America Safe Again.\u201d The headline speaker was Melania Trump. I have a better chance of winning an Olympic gold in gymnastics than of connecting those dots. But why should Donald Trump\u2019s coronation be any tidier than his campaign? He indulges his whims. He goes with his gut. And the opening of the Republican National Convention here was a mirror of the man: visceral, rambling, sporadically mesmerizing, occasionally baffling, brimming with contempt for Hillary Clinton and beset by divisions within the G.O.P. It wasn\u2019t the star-studded, gee-whiz show that he once promised, and this, too, reflected Trump. His sales pitch is grand, even when the product is anything but. But there was oddity nonetheless, starting just after dawn. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager, used a string of morning appearances to denounce John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for not endorsing Trump, calling that calculation \u201cdumb, dumb, dumb.\u201d He thus focused attention on all of the prominent Republicans who were skipping this convention rather than on all of the prominent Republicans who did show up. How is that smart, smart, smart? And Melania\u2019s remarks were a reminder of the way in which a man who has had three families is somehow being presented to voters as the ultimate family man. \u201cDonald is intensely loyal,\u201d she said, though there\u2019s plenty in his biography to suggest otherwise. \u201cDonald intends to represent all the people, not just some of the people,\u201d she added, though there\u2019s nothing in the way he won the Republican nomination to give voters any assurance of that. Her 15-minute testimonial will be followed in the nights to come by speeches by all of his children except the one still in grade school. Indeed, his brood has been so present and peripatetic during this campaign that I imagine them as some contemporary political analogue to the Partridge family, clattering around the country in a gilded jet instead of a multicolored bus. For the most part, though, Melania simply stated over and over again what a one-of-a-kind talent her husband is and what an amazing president he\u2019d be. Her language didn\u2019t vary much, her details were few and her evidence, to the extent that she provided any, wasn\u2019t particularly compelling. She\u2019s his perfect match, not just in love but in vagueness. We learned nothing important from her, but we learned something important about him when he introduced her. It was an unusual move, coming into the arena like that, and it stirred speculation among observers \u2014 and fear among his supporters \u2014 that he\u2019d pull a stunt like he did when he monopolized the microphone at Mike Pence\u2019s big unveiling, letting his sidekick know just how far to the side he\u2019d be kicking. CLEVELAND \u2014 Andra Lance scolded me for not having heard that Bill Clinton, while he was Arkansas governor, had visited \u201crich hotshots who want to run the world\u201d promising them secret, special favors from his, and now his wife\u2019s, administration. Most liberals, who have their own like-minded news sites, have never heard of these websites. But they\u2019re where the alt-right gets much of its news. They\u2019re also where Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign got the Star of David artwork and the spurious black-on-white crime statistics for his tweets. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re right about everything,\u201d Ms. Lance said. \u201cBut they are right about a lot of things.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not much of a conspiracy theorist,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there could very well be something going on.\u201d \u201cOur enemy is not other Republicans,\u201d Pastor Mark Burns, from South Carolina, told the convention hall, \u201cbut is Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.\u201d Pastors on all sides of the aisle sometimes get carried away by their politics or ideology, but I can\u2019t remember ever hearing a minister give a benediction that described a political rival as the \u201cenemy\u201d and was so nakedly polarizing: Somehow Jesus\u2019 message morphed from \u201clove your neighbor\u201d to \u201cDemocrats are the enemy.\u201d God should sue the Republican National Convention for defamation. When I came upon the scene, all I could tell was that two men were shouting at each other at very close range. Then I realized the elderly man wearing a bedazzled jean jacket with the founding fathers on the back was Mr. King. The Republican National Convention so far is like South by Southwest for washed-up entertainers. People not granted access to the Quicken Loans Arena itself float from event to event, stopping to congregate in a mass around any vaguely recognizable C-list celebrity they see. Shortly before Scott Baio was slated to give a prime-time speech, Mr. King walked down Hudson Avenue with a small entourage. \u201cThis is fantastic! We are fighting for a better America!\u201d Mr. King told no one in particular. The man who had been grilling Mr. King in the doorway of the Marriott Hotel once again pressed him on his past, specifically his manslaughter conviction. \u201cYou killed a guy,\u201d the interrogator from the Marriott standoff said. \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Mr. King said absent-mindedly, before he registered the comment. \u201cWhat? Honestly, I accept a deep sympathy for the loss of a human being, but not for being human.\u201d He continued walking down Huron Road, destination unknown. \u201cDon King! Don King! I love you!\u201d a male Trump supporter yelled. A female Trump supporter stopped Mr. King to take a selfie with him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Baby. Look at me, look at me, look at me,\u201d she said, as if she were taking a photo of a puppy. I decided to embrace the enveloping abyss and ask Don King a semi-serious question: What did he make of the report that Reince Priebus did not want him to speak at the convention? \u201cI think he\u2019s been lost in a capsule, a time capsule. You know that guy \u2014 what\u2019s that guy, he needs to go back in time? What\u2019s his little name?\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cHe must be Rip Van Winkle. That\u2019s what it is. He is Rip Van Winkle! He\u2019s been asleep for 20 years because he don\u2019t know what time it is!\u201d It was the most astute political commentary I\u2019d heard all day. To hear Donald Trump talk, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2003 vote in favor of the Iraq war disqualifies her for the presidency. \u201cIn short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a policy speech in June. \u201cIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place.\u201d Of course, if he believed this, he\u2019d have to drop out of the race, too. Asked about the disparity, Mr. Trump did not even flinch. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said about Mr. Pence\u2019s pro-war position. The vote took place a \u201clong time ago,\u201d and Mr. Pence \u201cis entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,\u201d Mr. Trump added. But Mrs. Clinton is not? \u201cNo. She\u2019s not,\u201d he replied. As for his own past position on the war, he\u2019s giving himself a pass. Many of the speeches at the Trump convention promise to be interesting mostly in their awkwardness. (Watch as Paul Ryan pretends that his party is nominating Jack Kemp! Watch as Chris Christie enacts the final act of \u201cDoctor Faustus\u201d!) But anyone interested in the legacy of Trumpism as a movement, rather than just a one-election-cycle cult, should pay close attention to three speakers. Second, Ivanka Trump, speaking Thursday. The jokes about Trump considering his daughter as a running mate were (probably) just that, but it\u2019s clear that Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are the closest thing to a superego in the Trump campaign, and it\u2019s easy to imagine the father\u2019s ascent encouraging ambitions in his most impressive child. It\u2019s a bit harder to imagine Ivanka playing Marine Le Pen to Donald\u2019s Jean-Marie: A jet-setting New York socialite (and convert to Judaism) is an unlikely leader for an aggrieved heartland nationalism. But in a world where Trump can be the G.O.P. nominee, all manner of things seem possible, and her speech might drop a hint as to whether she feels any political temptations. In the media, who can tell the margins from the mainstream anymore? Video coverage of the Republican National Convention this week will be dizzyingly decentralized, with social media and regular media locked in a codependent death match \u2014 and everyman anchors, each with her own agenda, reporting or commenting on the event via social media in every conceivable digital dialect. And it\u2019s those competing dialects \u2014 among journalists, protesters, delegates, ideologues and the far-flung convention audience \u2014 that threaten to tilt into cacophony. Riots in the street have been predicted by some; riotous exchanges in the media are a certainty. From amateurs using social media, expect \u201cgotcha\u201d moments, or efforts to invent those moments, as well as the kind of \u201creverse surveillance\u201d that has recently allowed and even incentivized the filming of misdeeds by police, protesters and campaign workers. From the networks, look for a defensive crouch. They\u2019re fiercely guarding institutional authority by shooting video as if this convention were media business-as-usual, keeping their eyes on the podium and on benign cutaways (unless news they deem news breaks among the audience or protesters). While Facebook Live, the hugely popular live-streaming service, will be available as a platform for visual commentary to any of Facebook\u2019s 1.65 billion active monthly users, it also will feature C-Span\u2019s coverage front and center. This means it\u2019s not only offering polyglot and populist coverage but also monopolizing the cameras known for greatest comprehensiveness, beige-tone and neutrality. Twitter is streaming CBS\u2019s video, so the young and rambunctious service is now synced up with the Tiffany Network, which has authoritatively, even arrogantly, covered conventions (first as radio) for nearly a century. To witness CBS\u2019s god\u2019s-eye perspective streaming through Twitter\u2019s vox populi interface is sure to generate cognitive dissonance. The Republican National Convention\u2019s own robust app is live-streaming video from Google, using 360-degree cameras for, the app promises, \u201can immersive experience.\u201d The oligopoly that is Google serving as back end for the G.O.P.\u2019s self-coverage? Can anyone imagine ABC, say, playing vendor for the Republican Party in covering the convention? Public airways \u2014 and their F.C.C. mandate to provide balanced coverage \u2014 have all but disintegrated. Between cameraphone fragments and unlikely network-digital bedfellows, anticipated \u201cchaos\u201d in Cleveland this week may be mirrored, if not aggravated, by the thousands of skirmishing cameras, each with its own perspective. A: The most that I\u2019ve used is more than one million, but that\u2019s when we were going for world records. As far as the political conventions, I think the most we ever did was more than 200,000, and that was in 1992 down in Houston. In Cleveland this year we\u2019re over 100,000. A: I don\u2019t know the exact particulars; I feel bad for the people that were involved. Years ago, I developed a system when I required large amounts of labor, I would go to local high schools \u2014 primarily the music departments because I was a band geek myself back in high school. We give them a special shirt, we feed them, we pay for their buses, and at the end of the day we give them a nice honorarium that they can use for musical instruments. A: One hundred and twenty students and 20 adult chaperones. A: Oh yeah. I call the drop. It\u2019s almost like playing a piano. It\u2019s not just a cue, \u201cgo!\u201d and they all fall down. They\u2019ll come down in wave after wave after wave. There will probably be more than 20 different cues. A: We get to make the mess, but we don\u2019t have to clean up. Among the 25 prime-time speakers listed is a mother, Mary Ann Mendoza whose son was killed by an undocumented immigrant driving drunk the wrong way down an Arizona freeway. Another, Jamiel Shaw, lost his son, a high school football star, to another undocumented immigrant who had just been released from jail for offenses that probably should have gotten him deported. Patricia Smith\u2019s son died in Benghazi, Libya. The lineup also includes two siblings \u2014 the brother and sister of a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, fatally shot in 2010 on the Arizona-Mexican border by Mexican gangsters wielding an American gun they\u2019d picked up from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 much-criticized \u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d program. Mothers, this is your night. If you think that Donald Trump couldn\u2019t possibly appeal to female voters, given remarks he has made about breasts, Megyn Kelly\u2019s menstrual blood and women being \u201cdisgusting pigs,\u201d think again. Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who was recently hired by Trump\u2019s campaign, agrees. Asked by Katie Couric what Trump could do to capture women voters, she said: \u201cKeep talking about security, affordability, fairness and ethics. I call it the SAFE acronym.\u201d In a Fox News interview this month with six self-identified \u201csecurity moms,\u201d the women stressed the importance of \u201cnaming the enemy\u201d \u2014 jihadists \u2014 controlling immigration and helping them protect their children. Asked about the president\u2019s response to the killing of three police officers in Baton Rouge, La., Trump said: \u201cI mean, you know, I watched the president and sometimes the words are O.K.,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut you just look at the body language. There\u2019s something going on. Look, there\u2019s something going on and the words are not often O.K., by the way.\u201d To his credit, the host of the program, Steve Doocy, pressed Trump to explain what he meant. But of course, that\u2019s not how Trump operates. He puts ridiculous claims and accusations out there, sometimes obliquely, and refuses to take responsibility for them. \u201cThere\u2019s just a bad feeling, a lot of bad feeling about him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI see it, too. There\u2019s a lot of bad feeling about him. We have a country that has not been like this since I can remember it.\u201d What bad feeling, apart from the one among those who hate Obama because he is African-American? What kind of country does Trump mean? Who knows? The man who will be nominated as the Republican\u2019s presidential candidate this week has done this before. After the Orlando terrorist massacre, he also implied that Obama was on the side of terrorism. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable. There\u2019s something going on.\u201d There is something going on, indeed. Trump and his allies are running a campaign of racism, fear, xenophobia and social division that is horrifying, even by the standards of the current Republican Party. It has been turning itself over to these forces for decades now. Nothing that Trump says this week \u2014 if he indeed says anything unifying, moderate or conciliatory \u2014 can change that. \nSince at least 1952, no presidential candidate has overcome a polling deficit immediately after the party conventions and gone on to win the popular vote.\nOnce \u2014 in the days of Lincoln, the Roosevelts and Eisenhower \u2014 political conventions actually chose the nominee. Today, they feel like long infomercials. Yet it turns out that conventions still matter, more than many people realize. The conventions are the first time that many Americans tune into the presidential campaign. That\u2019s especially true for swing voters, most of whom don\u2019t vote in the two parties\u2019 primaries. The conventions may be infomercials, but they\u2019re infomercials that millions of people watch or otherwise pay attention to. But emerging from the conventions with a lead is a big deal. The closest thing to an exception over the last 60 years is Ronald Reagan, who was merely tied with Jimmy Carter immediately after the 1980 conventions. (George W. Bush trailed Al Gore modestly after the 2000 conventions, but, of course, also went on to lose the popular vote.) The typical pattern is for both candidates to get a boost from their own convention, but for the boosts to be different in size. And once the convention is over, any subsequent changes in the polls \u2014 yes, even after debates \u2014 tend to be small or fleeting. \u201cDebates don\u2019t have anywhere near the same effect\u201d as conventions, Erikson told me. Even more difficult, Trump will need to win over swing voters who helped elect President Obama. Somehow, Trump will have to persuade them that his string of offensive remarks about women, Muslims, Latinos, the disabled and others don\u2019t define him. He\u2019ll have to make himself seem presidential. Given Clinton\u2019s advantage and Trump\u2019s chaotic convention planning, he seems unlikely to have a great next two weeks \u2014 which would be a relief to all of us who are alarmed by the Trump phenomenon. But whatever your feelings, you shouldn\u2019t dismiss the conventions as a sideshow. Trump is, if nothing else, a skilled performer, and he has a chance to receive more focused, positive attention in Cleveland than he ever has. The next four nights represent probably his last best chance to reintroduce himself to the American public. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pavel Sheremet, Journalist in Ukraine, Is Killed in Car Bombing", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The red Subaru was making its way through an intersection in central Kiev on Wednesday when the driver\u2019s door suddenly blew ajar with a burst of smoke.The blast threw the driver, Pavel G.

The vehicle stopped then rolled backward, and for a moment, he seemed to be struggling to crawl free of the wreckage, closed circuit video showed.\u201cIt seems this was an act done with the intention of destabilizing the situation in the country,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cIn the conditions of war and aggression, I am not excluding the possibility of some foreign interest here.\u201dRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry posted a statement on its website saying Mr. Sheremet was indeed a critic of the Russian government but that he had never been threatened by \u201cphysical violence\u201d for those views while in Russia. \u201cThe incumbent Ukrainian government, supported by its Euro-Atlantic patrons for its purportedly successful democratic reforms, did not manage to protect him,\u201d the statement said.On Tuesday, another journalist was attacked in Kiev but survived, though it was unclear if the two cases had any connection.A knife-wielding man ran toward Maria Rydvan, a reporter for the Ukrainian version of Forbes magazine, in a park and stabbed her before fleeing. \u201cIt was all very strange,\u201d Ms. Rydvan wrote on her Facebook page. The police issued a statement saying they were investigating.Mr. Sheremet, 44, a onetime employee of Russian state television turned critic of the Kremlin, was among several prominent journalists who had moved from Russia to Ukraine, where restrictions on the news media are looser. Members of this group have also been highly critical of the new leadership in Ukraine.Mr. Sheremet had been a reporter for ORT, the leading Russian state television channel, until 2008. In Ukraine, he had a program on Radio Vesti \u2014 he was on his way to the studio when he died \u2014 and wrote for Ukrainska Pravda, an online news outlet.In 2000, a Ukrainska Pravda reporter, Georgiy Gongadze, who had been highly critical of the Ukrainian president at the time, Leonid Kuchma, was abducted and killed, a crime that still haunts Ukrainian journalists.Yevgeny A. Kiselyov, another Russian television news star who set up shop in Ukraine after a crackdown on the press at home, told Dozhd television he had seen Mr. Sheremet only recently, and the two had planned to get together. \u201cThis is what is called \u2018the meeting didn\u2019t work out.\u2019\u201d\u201cA journalist can be killed not only because he is carrying out a particular investigation, or he interviewed somebody who became offended,\u201d Mr. Kiselyov said. \u201cA journalist can be killed as an edifying lesson for others.

{"Headline": "Kevin Durant Reboots, Goes Digital", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byNotebookThere was a technical glitch. The Golden State Warriors, breakers of unbreakable records, failed to finish the season as repeat N.B.A. champions. Silicon Valley\u2019s hometown team lost to some guys from the Rust Belt. So this week the Warriors upgraded their operating system. An already-extraordinary lineup that included the league\u2019s two-time reigning M.V.P., Steph Curry, added the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Kevin Durant, the best scorer of his generation and the last M.V.P. before Curry.One study has found that the average American checks his or her phone 46 times a day. (Am I sick to admit that sounds kind of low?) There is a kind of paradox in the fact that much of what fuels those dozens of visits is content siphoned from the old citadels, New York and Hollywood. But no one reaches for Hollywood 46 times a day. Considered in that light, Durant joining the Warriors is the latest piece of evidence, if another were needed, that the cultural center of gravity has shifted from Los Angeles to Silicon Valley.All those celebrities sitting courtside at Lakers games (assuming they still go to Lakers games) \u2014 their influence has withered when set beside the rise of Netflix, Apple, Facebook and others. The video-game industry alone rivals the Hollywood box office. A different set of people, some 380 miles north of the Staples Center, now have their hands on the cultural levers. And they have the basketball team to prove it.Incredibly, Los Angeles hoped that Durant would spurn his other suitors and choose the Lakers. Once upon a time, that choice may have been tempting \u2014 the glamour, the celebrity, the movie deals. Durant didn\u2019t even take a meeting with the Lakers. (Though he did meet with the Los Angeles Clippers, the city\u2019s perpetual step-child. It went nowhere.)A snubbing like that would have been inconceivable not long ago, when the Lakers reigned: five championships in the 1980s, another five in the 2000s. You could see the city\u2019s swagger in the reflections from Jack Nicholson\u2019s sunglasses, Pat Riley\u2019s shiny slicked-back hair, Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s glistening pate.That was by design. Jerry West, a Hall of Famer who spent 40 years with the Lakers, recently published a memoir in which he recounts Jerry Buss\u2019s vision for the team, which Buss bought in 1979. \u201cJerry wasn\u2019t buying a basketball team,\u201d West writes. \u201cHe was buying the Lakers as a form of high-level entertainment, Hollywood style, including scantily clad girls.\u201dThe Lakers are no longer entertaining, haven\u2019t been in years. In the age of big data and performance-metrics analytics, the notion of sports as show business feels as dated as Busby Berkeley. Sports have become mathematics. Sports have become tech.West devoted virtually his entire life to the Lakers, first as a point guard, then as an executive. He was a Los Angeles icon through several Hollywood golden ages, a man so revered that his statue stands outside the Lakers\u2019 stadium. (As Buss put it at the dedication, \u201cHow many people ever get a statue?\u201d) Is it a coincidence that three months after the statue\u2019s unveiling, West agreed to join, of all teams, the Warriors? This is the team he now serves as a kind of spiritual adviser, bringing an aura of gravitas and success to the organization. Tech companies like to associate with graybeards in this way. And like so much else in Silicon Valley, the connection works. By several accounts, it was West\u2019s personal phone call to Durant that helped seal the deal.In his memoir, West doesn\u2019t say much about what drew him to Silicon Valley. His relationship with Lakers management had fractured. The Warriors\u2019 new tech luminaries, the owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, had an \u201centhusiasm for what they were hoping to achieve [that] was contagious.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to call Durant\u2019s move part of our long national migration west, dating back to the Gold Rush. (Through that lens, it\u2019s fitting that the team is named not after an actual city but a honeyed oasis called \u201cGolden State.\u201d) After all, where was the miserable address Tom Joad left behind? Oklahoma, same as Durant.But Durant\u2019s move to the Warriors brings a digital sheen to the story. He announced his decision in a letter posted to a relatively new site called The Players\u2019 Tribune, where his title is \u201cdeputy publisher.\u201d The site was created to bypass traditional gatekeepers, like The New York Times, by giving athletes a platform that does not require interacting with journalists. It implies nothing sinister to point out that The Players\u2019 Tribune has received millions in funding from New Enterprise Associates, one of the biggest venture firms in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s simply how the world works today.When I was growing up, my dad used to root against the Lakers because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see all those people in Los Angeles happy.\u201d Plenty of others felt the same way: \u201cBeat L.A.\u201d became a national chant. That distaste wasn\u2019t entirely, or even mostly, about the basketball team. It was about Los Angeles as a cultural Goliath. The place represented the unreality of American myth-making, embodied our love-hate relationship with Hollywood, schlock and all, and its dominance of pop culture. That power also made it an symbol of the rich always getting richer.Our new love-hate relationship is with our phones, those gorgeous little tyrants.

{"Headline": "Not Even Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Can Say No to \u2018Mozart in the Jungle\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byVENICE \u2014 It was after midnight on the Grand Canal here, and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was standing on a floating stage slowly motoring toward the Accademia Bridge, singing the opening lines of a duet from \u201cDon Giovanni.\u201dA soprano\u2019s voice answered from a second float heading to meet his, on which the actress Monica Bellucci, made up like Maria Callas in a teal gown and glittering diamonds, lip-synced seductively. The stages came together, and so did the voices.With this operatically over-the-top spectacle last week \u2014 which drew squeals and flurries of smartphone photos as people passed on a vaporetto, or water bus \u2014 Mr. Domingo became the latest classical star to shoot a cameo for \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d the Amazon comedy about a fictional New York orchestra.It was not always thus.David Gockley, the veteran American impresario, said that those television appearances drove a wider interest in the art form \u2014 and sold tickets. \u201cOur audience knew a lot of these names because they were on television,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the mainstream media paying much attention to opera these days, and it makes a difference.\u201dPeter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, said that dwindling television opportunities had forced the company to reach audiences in new ways \u2014 both by starting its Live in HD cinema simulcasts and through social media. Last season, he said, the Met\u2019s videos were viewed about 7.5 million times on Facebook and YouTube. \u201cWe have to create our own communications systems,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.The show, of course, has Mozart in its title, and is loosely based on the 2005 memoir of the same name by Blair Tindall, an oboist who set out to explore, in the words of her subtitle, \u201cSex, Drugs and Classical Music.\u201d So a good portion of the viewers who stream it may already be music fans. But with a cast that includes stars like Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Bernadette Peters, Malcolm McDowell, Lola Kirke and, in a small role, Jason Schwartzman, the series also draws viewers who may not (yet) have subscriptions to their local orchestras.Paul Weitz, who was directing the episode with Mr. Domingo and is an executive producer of the show with Roman Coppola and Mr. Schwartzman, said that the possibility of reaching those viewers was especially enticing to the musicians who have appeared.\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a huge issue, and it\u2019s something that is dealt with in the show a lot, about whether classical music is going to be passed on to a new generation,\u201d Mr. Weitz said between shots in his director\u2019s chair. \u201cAnd all these artists, the reasons that they\u2019re doing this show is because they feel like it\u2019s good for that aspect of the art \u2014 that it can bring the music to different people. And anecdotally, I think that\u2019s actually the case.\u201dMr. Domingo, who moved to Mexico as a child and maintains strong ties there, said that he was drawn partly by the chance to appear with Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal, a Mexican actor whose career he has followed since the film \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d more than a decade ago, and partly because he was intrigued by a new series that shines a light on the field.So Mr. Domingo, who remains one of the hardest workers in opera, recorded his vocals for the duet, \u201cL\u00e0 ci darem la mano,\u201d this month at a midnight session at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, right after finishing a performance there in the title role of Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimon Boccanegra.\u201d (The soprano part, which Ms. Bellucci, who is playing a fiery diva known as La Fiamma, lip-synced to, was recorded in San Francisco by the rising star Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez.)And last week he flew here for a one-night shoot, the day after singing in Verdi\u2019s \u201cI Due Foscari\u201d at Teatro Real in Madrid, where he sang the role of the Doge of Venice. \u201cWhen I finished,\u201d he said, \u201cI said, \u2018Tomorrow I\u2019ll go to my city to see how my people are behaving.\u2019\u201dMr. Weitz said that the aria struck the tone he strove for in the show \u2014 mixing ridiculous and comic elements with sublime moments, through music. \u201cNico\u2019s fake Amy Fisher opera actually achieves that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely preposterous and silly and at the same time \u2014 and this was very important, it\u2019s what I was hoping for \u2014 it\u2019s actually moving.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Confuse Veterans and Violence", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIT was clear the shooter had some training.When the news was breaking from Dallas, before we knew who he was, or even that there was only one shooter and not three or four, military veterans watched the horror unfolding on our computer screens along with the rest of America. And to our disgust, we recognized a few things.It turned out he was \u2014 he had deployed to Afghanistan as a mason and carpenter. Now, in Baton Rouge, La., we have a second shooter of police officers, this one an Iraq veteran, though again, not one who had seen combat, but a former data network specialist. Both of these men were part of our veterans\u2019 community, attacking another community we have always identified with: the police.In Iraq, I knew so many Marines with plans of joining their local police force back home it was almost comical, and the reserve units around New York City are chock-full of officers from the police force there. I was once caught going well above the speed limit and the officer who pulled me over saw the Marine Corps sticker on the back of my car. He didn\u2019t ask me if I knew how fast I was going; he wanted to know if I\u2019d been to Iraq. \u201cYeah, I just got back,\u201d I said. \u201cHow is it over there?\u201d he asked me, a little nervous. \u201cI\u2019m in a reserve unit, and we\u2019re deploying next year.\u201dBut now, two deadly attacks later, many Americans are looking at veterans and wondering what\u2019s going on.Clearly, the combination of training and access to assault weapons makes an individual more deadly than they would otherwise be. The Dallas shooter would not qualify as a sniper by the standards of the American military, but it doesn\u2019t take much to be lethal with the right weaponry.My job was about as POG (military slang for noncombat arms) as it gets, but I was still able to reliably hit a man-size target from 500 yards during my annual rifle qualification. Compared with a handgun, which isn\u2019t much use beyond about 30 yards, a competently handled assault rifle is incredibly deadly, especially against officers who are exposed, out on the streets.Or maybe the problem was that they hadn\u2019t seen combat, and instead they wanted the glory they missed overseas and decided to live out the quintessential American fantasy of being a \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d standing up against injustice. But in these shootings \u201cinjustice\u201d was represented in Dallas by officers from a reform-minded police force that had productively responded to the concerns of activists and radically reduced excessive force complaints, and in Baton Rouge, represented by good-hearted cops like Montrell Jackson, who just days before his murder had written on Facebook: \u201cI\u2019m working in these streets so any protesters, officers, friends, family, or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer, I got you.\u201d Who knows? Deciphering the intentions of the insane and the vile is a risky business.Even riskier, though, is using the actions of a few deranged men to represent an entire community, whether it\u2019s the activist community, whose nationwide protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, or whether it\u2019s the veteran community, which represents more than 20 percent of all adult males in the country. And though, yes, veterans will all have some training in violence, the percentage of veterans among state and federal prisoners has steadily declined over the past three decades.A truer image of the American veteran is seen not in these killers, but in their victims. Matthew Gerald, whom a friend called \u201cmade to serve the people,\u201d served three tours in Iraq, was a father of two and had been on the job only a short while before his murder in Baton Rouge. Patrick Zamarripa, a Navy veteran who had also deployed three times to Iraq, loved his job, was known to family and friends as a peacemaker, and died in Dallas. As Gen. John R. Allen recently told me of American military men and women, \u201cthe Republic doesn\u2019t hire them to kill, the Republic hires them to be prepared to die for something greater than themselves.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what those men did.Phil Klay is a Marine Corps veteran and the author of \u201cRedeployment,\u201d a short story collection.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Protect Privacy While Using Pok\u00e9mon Go and Other Apps", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byIn the last few days, security bloggers noticed that the game, which is free to download and made by Niantic Inc. in partnership with the Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo, requested permission not only to use a player\u2019s smartphone camera and location data but also to gain full access to the user\u2019s Google accounts \u2014 including email, calendars, photos, stored documents and any other data associated with the login.The flap highlights how clicking \u201cyes\u201d to whatever requests pop up when installing an app on a mobile device can compromise privacy, sometimes in insidious ways. In disclosures, some apps say they will hand over data to law enforcement officials or other private parties to respond to legal requests, for example, or even on their own volition.\u201cA number of these games are not only making money on the front end by selling you the game or things within the game, they\u2019re also collecting data about your habits and what you\u2019re doing on your phone, and selling that to third-party marketers,\u201d said Andrew Storms, vice president of security services at the security company New Context. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty much giving the rights to all your information to this company.\u201dSo what can be done to minimize the security risks that come with some apps? Here\u2019s a refresher on how to safeguard private information.Ari Rubinstein, a Silicon Valley security engineer, recommends paying close attention to the scope of access that apps request during installation \u2014 or to look up the details online \u2014 and say \u201cno\u201d if the demands make you uncomfortable.If you are unsure about the permissions you have already granted, check them on iOS by clicking on Settings and scrolling down for a list of apps that you can examine and change individually. On Android, click Settings and click Apps under the Device Settings, then choose an app and select Permissions.Permissions are not the only things to worry about; you also need to know what kinds of data an app is collecting from your phone. Information about those is typically contained in an app\u2019s privacy policies, which are often available within the settings of an app, or searchable online. If you cannot find the disclosures, or you are unable to understand their legalese, consider holding off until you learn more.As for Pok\u00e9mon Go, while the game may not be digging through emails, it is capable of tracking your location. And like those of many apps, its privacy policy allows it to give any data it has about you to law enforcement officials or private parties in response to legal requests or even to whatever it may deem an unethical or legally actionable activity. It can also share nonidentifying information about you with other companies for what it says are \u201cresearch and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes.\u201dBecause apps often use platforms like Facebook and Google to authenticate accounts, Mr. Rubinstein suggests regularly checking the access you have granted through the settings of these systems.With Facebook, go to your account settings and click on Apps to examine and revoke access. With Google, go to Privacy and Security Settings and click on Connected Apps and Sites to see or change the apps connected to your account.\u201cMost likely users have apps that they never use that put them at a similar risk\u201d to that from the Pok\u00e9mon app, he said.Advertisement"}

The project was hailed as a way to bring thousands of jobs to Mississippi, the nation\u2019s poorest state, and to extend a lifeline to the dying coal industry.The sense of hope is fading fast, however. The Kemper coal plant is more than two years behind schedule and more than $4 billion over its initial budget, $2.4 billion, and it is still not operational.The plant\u2019s backers, including federal energy officials, have defended their work in recent years by saying that delays and cost overruns are inevitable with innovative projects of this scale. In this case, they say, the difficulties stem largely from unforeseen factors \u2014 or \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201d as Tom Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, has often called them \u2014 like bad weather, labor shortages and design uncertainties.Many problems plaguing the project were broadly known and had been occurring for years. But a review by The New York Times of thousands of pages of public records, previously undisclosed internal documents and emails, and 200 hours of secretly though legally recorded conversations among more than a dozen colleagues at the plant offers a detailed look at what went wrong and why.Those documents and recordings, provided to The Times by a whistle-blower, an engineer named Brett Wingo, and interviews with more than 30 current or former regulators, contractors, consultants or engineers who worked on the project, show that the plant\u2019s owners drastically understated the project\u2019s cost and timetable, and repeatedly tried to conceal problems as they emerged.The system of checks and balances that are supposed to keep such projects on track was outweighed by a shared and powerful incentive: The company and regulators were eager to qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal subsidies for the plant, which was also aggressively promoted by Haley Barbour, who was Southern\u2019s chief lobbyist before becoming the governor of Mississippi. Once in office, Mr. Barbour signed a law in 2008 that allowed much of the cost of building any new power plants to be passed on to ratepayers before they are built.Seeing so many of the problems from the inside, at least one employee felt the need to speak up.\u201cI\u2019ve reached a personal tipping point and feel a duty to act,\u201d Mr. Wingo wrote in a 2014 email, which was among several that he sent to officials of Southern Company and Mississippi Power, the state utility that runs the plant, alleging that the company had broken federal law and engaged in corporate fraud. \u201cHope is not a strategy,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a high-profile project with many misguided enemies, so why give them free ammo?\u201dIn their recorded conversations with Mr. Wingo, at least six senior engineers from the plant said that they believed that the delays and cost overruns, as well as safety violations and shoddy work, were partly the result of mismanagement or fraud.\u201cIt has nothing to do with the design, it has nothing to do with the technology, it just has to do with poor project management,\u201d Landon Lunsford, an engineer at the plant, said during one recorded call with Mr. Wingo last December, when they discussed an email from Southern\u2019s legal department telling senior employees to retain all emails because of a continuing S.E.C. investigation.The company will never admit the project-management problems because they will attract more scrutiny from regulators, Mr. Lunsford said. \u201cAs long as they can talk away the results as attributable to something else other than just poor performance, the other public service commissions can\u2019t hold them over the fire as much,\u201d he added.Ed Holland, the former chief executive of Mississippi Power, added that one of the project\u2019s biggest mistakes was to start construction with little of the plant designed. \u201cWe still believe that from our investors\u2019 standpoint, this was a wise investment to prove the technology,\u201d he said in an interview.In the end, the Kemper project is a story of how a monopoly utility, with political help from the Mississippi governor and from federal energy officials who pressured state regulators in letters to support the project, shifted the burden of one of the most expensive power plants ever built onto the shoulders of unwitting investors and some of the lowest-income ratepayers in the country.Kemper\u2019s rising price tag and other problems will probably affect the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposed rules on new power plants, and also play into broader discussions about the best way to counter climate change. E.P.A. regulations in effect require new coal plants to have carbon capture technology but are being held up in federal court partly by arguments that the technology is not cost-effective.The importance of this technology grows, as well, after President Obama said last week that the United States would join Canada and Mexico in pledging to reach a shared goal of generating 50 percent of North America\u2019s electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2025, up from 37 percent today, with a power mix that includes wind, solar, hydropower, nuclear energy and coal or gas power paired with carbon capture technology.Coal represents a conundrum: It is among the dirtiest sources of fuel, producing roughly 45 percent of the emissions that contribute to climate change. And yet the world still relies on it for power, with more than a quarter of the electricity used globally coming from coal plants.Southern Company proposed a promising idea with the Kemper project. Providing a cleaner way to use coal, which is cheap and abundant in the United States, the plant also offered the means to preserve many coal-mining jobs that are fast disappearing in this part of the country.Kemper County, with mostly two-lane roads cutting through clay hills and pine forest, has an average per capita income of $14,837 and an unemployment rate roughly double the national average. To the region, the plant offered more than clean power: It promised hope, at least 12,000 jobs and long-term savings. As construction ramped up, the county took in over $8 million annually in extra tax money, which went toward repairing roads, bridges and schools, lowering local property taxes, and clearing debt.In the summer of 2005, as Hurricane Katrina toppled drilling rigs and uprooted pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico, the price of natural gas rose by more than 40 percent. In Mississippi, utility regulators saw the Kemper plant as a way to diversify its energy options in a state that relies on natural gas for nearly 80 percent of its electricity.A primer on carbon capture and storage, and why it has an uncertain future as a force for fighting climate change.The plant, which broke ground in 2010, would run on lignite, a type of coal that is difficult to process but is plentiful in the region. Most of the carbon dioxide produced by the plant would be captured, compressed, sold and piped to oil fields. There, it would be pumped underground in a process known as enhanced oil recovery, to help push up previously unrecoverable oil to levels where it could be reached.Though carbon capture technology is proven and widely viewed as a potentially important tool to slow global warming, the question has been whether it can be scaled up affordably.Carbon capture has been considered a holy grail for decades. For Ronald Reagan, it was a solution to acid rain; for Bill Clinton, an alternative to nuclear power. George W. Bush billed his FutureGen project as the world\u2019s first zero-emissions coal plant but mothballed it when it became too expensive.As the emphasis on fighting climate change grew, the Obama administration hung many of its hopes on Kemper. Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A. administrator, cited federal support for the project as proof that her agency was not anti-coal, despite strict new rules on power-plant emissions. The Energy Department repeatedly wrote state regulators emphasizing the importance of the project.By 2012, though, \u201cMiss Power,\u201d as locals called the state utility, was facing mounting criticism about the plant. In May of that year, after the utility said that the Kemper project was $366 million over budget, it announced a plan to raise its customers\u2019 rates by 13 percent.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to pay to build my home, and I don\u2019t want to pay to build your plant,\u201d John Gooding, a cabinetmaker from Bay St. Louis, who lost his home in Hurricane Katrina, said during a public hearing about the rate hikes. \u201cSome people are still living in trailers, and now you want to build a plant you can\u2019t guarantee.\u201dOther critics piled on. Environmentalists called the plant the \u201cSolyndra of clean coal,\u201d a reference to the heavily subsidized but failed federal solar project. They asked whether the plant\u2019s climate change benefits were overstated because the carbon it would capture from coal was going to be used to pump more oil.Why was Kemper being cited as a model worthy of replicating, they asked, given that other plants would not share one of Kemper\u2019s main advantages: a plentiful supply of cheap coal nearby.Alleging that Southern Company and Mississippi Power had overstated the plant\u2019s cost-effectiveness, the Bigger Pie Forum sued to unseal project records. To help make their case that the Kemper plant would be competitive with natural gas, which is coal\u2019s main competitor, utility executives predicted to investors and regulators that the per-unit price for natural gas would be higher than $11 by 2016. But gas remains less than $2 per unit, undermining the business case for the plant.The project did create jobs, but Mark Klinedinst, a retired economics professor from the University of Southern Mississippi, said that more were lost in the region as businesses laid people off to pay for the higher electrical bills caused by Mississippi Power rate increases from plant construction. The University of Southern Mississippi also raised annual tuition $236 per student, partly to offset its additional $1 million in higher electrical costs, he said.Mr. Wingo, 48, had lived paycheck to paycheck for years, working at small, struggling engineering firms. When he was hired in 2007 by a subsidiary of Southern, it was a big step up. He doubled his salary to become a midlevel manager to help oversee scheduling and some design decisions on a project that he believed would make history.Before long, Southern began flying him around the country to explain the project to others. He received glowing performance reviews and was awarded an annual $2,000 \u201cSouthern Excellence\u201d employee award.By 2012, though, Mr. Wingo had begun his transition to whistle-blower. About two weeks after state regulators renewed the license for the project to continue, Mississippi Power admitted to regulators that it had concealed cost overruns of about $366 million.In increasingly testy meetings and emails over succeeding months, Mr. Wingo told his supervisors that other scheduling information that Mississippi Power and Southern Company were providing to the public was infeasible and misleading.Ed Day, Mississippi Power\u2019s chief executive at the time, tried to tighten control over what was shared. \u201cI would like to remind everyone \u2018again,\u2019 no numbers, schedules, or information in general should be communicated to external parties until I review it/them first,\u201d Mr. Day wrote in an Aug. 8, 2012, email to senior staff.Others shared Mr. Wingo\u2019s growing concerns. Tom Theodore, a scheduling consultant who worked on the Kemper project for about eight months in 2012, described the company\u2019s stated schedule as little more than \u201ca pretty picture to show everybody that we\u2019re all doing wonderful as opposed to what reality showed on the ground.\u201dHis predecessors had altered the software so it no longer automatically adjusted the final price and completion date to reflect problems as they emerged, he said.Greg Zoll, who had been hired by the state to be the project\u2019s independent monitor, also grew skeptical. While engineering expenses and purchases went up, reported construction costs went down and scheduling timelines were shortened.\u201cThese trends are illogical,\u201d he wrote in of one of a series of highly critical reports that he filed with regulators from 2012 to 2014. Documents show that in a rush to qualify for federal subsidies, Mississippi Power started construction with less than 15 percent of the plant designed, Mr. Zoll told regulators.Mississippi Power rejected Mr. Zoll\u2019s criticism, responding that the delays were caused by glitchy software and shifts in design, and that the company was absorbing most of the additional costs.But Brandon Presley, now the chairman of the Mississippi Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, said that the project was troubled from the start and he voted against it. \u201cThe train left the station,\u201d he said, when, in a rush to qualify for millions of dollars in federal subsidies, the commission approved the project.He added that the problem was not the federal subsidies, which are necessary to develop innovative technology, but the failure by all parties to slow down and ask enough questions.On May 20, 2013, Mr. Day abruptly stepped down as chief executive. His replacement, Ed Holland, told regulators that Mr. Day had directed or allowed employees to withhold from regulators documents about cost overruns. That sparked public outcry because the information was withheld from the commission while it was deciding whether to reapprove the project. \u201cI will see that it never happens again,\u201d said Mr. Holland, according to news articles at the time.In February 2014, an argument erupted at the plant. Engineers told upper-level managers that the company should not promise to regulators and investors that the project would be done before the end of the year, emails and recorded calls show. Weeks later, the company did so anyway.The next day, the owner of the project\u2019s scheduling firm sent an email saying that he could not in good conscience continue to work on a project that did not \u201cfairly and accurately represent the work that still remains.\u201dMr. Wingo wrote in a subsequent email to an official at PricewaterhouseCoopers, an auditing firm that was helping to manage the project, \u201cThis has really put the entire project at a crossroads.\u201d The other engineers in his division were in \u201cutter disbelief\u201d that the company had published a false schedule, he added.On March 10, Mr. Wingo called Mr. Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, to ensure the message reached him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought this to me,\u201d Mr. Wingo said Mr. Fanning told him. \u201cI plan to get to the bottom of this.\u201dInstead, Southern Company and Mississippi Power focused in subsequent months at least as much on damage control as they did on rooting out wrongdoing.In meetings, Mr. Wingo and other engineers said that they were told by plant managers that they needed to present an optimistic timetable for the project or the utility risked \u201cfinancial Armageddon\u201d of lost tax subsidies, spooked investors, possible bankruptcy, and harsh criticism from the news media, regulators and lawmakers.After Mr. Wingo provided company officials with a binder of documents corroborating his allegations, he said he was ordered to stop sending emails on the matter because they could become public through litigation.After he told his manager in an email that most project engineers agreed that the plant could not be completed by 2014, the manager continued telling executives that \u201cto a man\u201d all of the plant\u2019s engineers thought that finishing by 2014 was feasible, Mr. Wingo said, and Mr. Lunsford, the engineer at the plant, reiterated in a recorded call that the manager\u2019s comment was false.Mr. Wingo, who began speaking to reporters, refused an offer of roughly $975,000 from the company to keep quiet, according to interviews and court records related to his whistle-blower claims. Southern was then granted a restraining order, later dropped, forbidding him from speaking publicly about the plant, court records show.Mr. Wingo said that he began recording his phone conversations in August 2014, hoping to protect himself. During those calls, at least two of Mr. Wingo\u2019s colleagues said that they strongly disagreed with what one of them called \u201chis grand conspiracy.\u201d A half-dozen other engineers told Mr. Wingo that they shared his views.The Times contacted each of the engineers whose conversations were recorded and shared by Mr. Wingo. All declined to comment.The recordings include commiseration among colleagues, and ambivalence from engineers who vacillated between criticizing and defending the project. They include typical workplace grousing about bosses who workers say are in need of \u201cViagra for the brain\u201d and are incapable of running even a Popsicle stand.They also reveal an internal struggle that Mr. Wingo faced: While still a believer in the possibility of clean coal, he was uneasy to find himself on the same side as environmental groups that oppose fossil fuels.\u201cMy enemy\u2019s enemy is not necessarily my friend,\u201d he said in one recorded conversation in February 2015.What troubled the engineers most was the poor quality of work: leaking gaskets, cracked ductwork, and pipes missing inspection records, valves and supports. Ryan Brown, a plant engineer, said during a phone call that he was having to \u201cgo back and do some sort of repair or rebuild\u201d for every piece of work handed to him by the plant\u2019s construction teams, which were under intense deadline pressure.In a call on Aug. 22, 2014, Mr. Wingo confronted one of his superiors, Brett Wingard, about photographs covertly taken by an inspector who was concerned about defective pipes at the plant. Mr. Wingard dismissed the threat, saying that the pipes were only in a section of the plant not yet in operation (part of the project is running on natural gas already). GPS information in the images indicates otherwise.Other workers recounted in phone calls to Mr. Wingo that they had discovered a large section of outdoor exhaust pipe that was glowing cherry red one night in September 2014 because 1,400-degree gases were misdirected through it. \u201cThat\u2019s so bad that it made people all over the company stand up and say this is ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Lunsford said in an October call with Mr. Wingo.Several co-workers warned Mr. Wingo against being \u201ca martyr.\u201d One engineer, Donald Falletta, told him in a phone call that jumping on a grenade \u201cwhen there ain\u2019t nobody else in the damn room don\u2019t save nobody.\u201d In a call six months later, Mr. Falletta added that he too believed that managers were being \u201ctold to lie\u201d about the pace of progress.In February 2015, Southern sued Mr. Wingo, alleging that he had agreed to a settlement but failed to comply with its terms, which included keeping quiet about the plant. Mr. Wingo said that he never signed or agreed to any settlement.Tim Leljedal, a spokesman for Southern Company, added that Mr. Wingo\u2019s allegations had been thoroughly investigated by the company and by outside counsel and were found to be unsubstantiated. He added that with any project of this scope, detractors are inevitable.Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Mr. Wingo\u2019s colleague, Robert Adams, called him to say that he was leaving the company and to ask whether he would be legally allowed to speak publicly about the plant at that point. \u201cOnce we resign, do you think they will try to silence us?\u201d asked Mr. Adams, who left the company shortly thereafter.In March, the company dropped its case against Mr. Wingo. \u201cHug that wife,\u201d Donald Falletta said in a phone conversation congratulating Mr. Wingo. \u201cShe\u2019s been through a damn roller-coaster ride.\u201dMeanwhile, engineers discussed the pressure to hurry construction. One of them, Brent Duncan, recounted in a phone call that he told a scheduling contractor how discouraged he was that managers were being allowed to \u201cscrew\u201d with the schedule and \u201cthen claim they can meet all these dates, and there\u2019s no way.\u201dThe engineers joked that Mississippi Power, eager to show progress to investors and regulators, overstated certain milestones. For example, it bragged of achieving the \u201cfirst fire,\u201d which involves the lighting of the gasifier, when what they did fell far short of the actual definition, according to Mr. Wingo.\u201cWe burned natural gas in a pilot\u201d light, Brandon Davis, an engineer, said during one phone conversation. \u201cI accomplish that every day in my garage.\u201dSome engineers wondered aloud whether accurate information was making it to the top. \u201cBy the time the message gets to Tom Fanning,\u201d Mr. Lunsford said in a September 2015 call, \u201cit\u2019s so muddled and messed up that he\u2019s not even hearing the truth.\u201dIn March, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alerted Southern that it had violated whistle-blower protections. The agency rejected the company\u2019s claim that it was justified in firing Mr. Wingo because he could \u201cnot be trusted to support the chain of command.\u201dIn April of this year, Southern informed the S.E.C. for at least the eighth consecutive month of a new delay and cost overrun, this time for $60 million, bringing the total spent on the Kemper project to about $6.7 billion. In May, the Obama administration said that it planned to cut spending on clean-coal technologies by 3 percent in next year\u2019s budget.Supporters of carbon capture say that Kemper\u2019s problems are not representative of the entire industry, and that one part of the plant \u2014 the gasifier that converts cheap coal into synthetic gas \u2014 is primarily causing the delays. But critics say that the principal challenge of carbon capture is cost, and that the gasifier\u2019s ability to use cheap coal has always been advertised as key to making the project affordable.As Mississippi Power and Southern Company have continued struggling to bring the plant online, Southern has repeatedly promoted in calls to investors its plans to help offset the project\u2019s cost by selling the carbon-capture technology abroad.For now, Mr. Presley, the chairman of the Mississippi Public Service Commission, says he is taking a wait-and-see approach, hoping that when and if the plant finally comes online, it works as promised. Mississippi Power has said that every month of delay adds more than $20 million to the overall cost, but it will charge customers for extra costs from the plant only with approval by the commission.Mr. Presley will eventually have to grapple with what he called the \u201cawful task\u201d of not pushing the utility into bankruptcy while determining how much electricity customers, taxpayers and investors should pay for the billions of dollars in cost overruns.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Refugee Family Resettles in Sweden, 9-Year-Old Nephew Dies", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byOn Friday, Ahmad Majid, a young Syrian refugee, learned he would be able to live in the peace and comfort of Sweden. Ten months after their arrival, he, his wife and their three children received a letter saying their application for permanent residency had been approved. Ahmad scrambled for an apartment and was on the road to his dream of opening an Arab grocery.But with sweet victory came sorrow.Ahmad\u2019s extended family of 14 arrived in Sweden last September, and three months later, authorities placed them in a traditional red farmhouse three hours outside Stockholm. When Grace and Mauricio and I visited there in April, the family lived as if in a commune; the men, women and children all shared in the cooking and cleaning.The family marveled over Donald J. Trump, wondering how Americans could fall for him. I told them that when I heard the words \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d I instinctively thought of terrorists. After that, Ahmad\u2019s older brother, Farid, said \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d to me at every opportunity, to tease me.On the road, they had called me \u201cMadame.\u201d Now they called me by my first name, and it seemed right.As Grace, the translator, and I were leaving, Farid, who had been kidnapped for ransom in Syria, asked me to leave something of mine behind, as a promise that I would return. I had only the blue silk scarf from Paris that my brother had given me. I held back. As soon as Grace and I got into the rental car and headed for the airport, I felt ashamed that I had not been more generous. They had been so hospitable, sharing their food, insisting that we stay in their house.After the call, we went to the hospital cafeteria with Nabih\u2019s Aunt Amina. Over tea, she remembered how much she adored her life as a French translator in Syria, before the war. Single and childless, Amina spent the last year at Nabih\u2019s bedside, supporting his exhausted parents. What would happen to her, she wondered, if Nabih got well enough to travel to Sweden to reunite with his family there. Would she be left behind?Ahmad\u2019s younger brother, Rezan, was also on sick duty in Turkey. He was on Facebook, constantly, trying to find blood donors for Nabih, who needed frequent transfusions. Rezan, the pampered youngest of four brothers, had gone to private school in Aleppo and was the only member of his family who spoke English. He hoped to study physics when the war was over. He was in his early 20s, the same age as my son. I laughed when I heard this, because he seemed older. And I felt a maternal tug.This summer, as the Majid family left Syria for Europe, The New York Times followed the group through weeks of defeat and triumph, disillusionment and determination.Rezan had been married a year before, despite his own reservations that he was too young. But he loved the girl, and he was afraid that if he did not marry her, someone else would. He left his wife and baby with his parents in their village in Afrin. He spent a lot of time walking the streets of Antalya, thinking, he said. When I left, he gave me a set of olive-wood worry beads from the flea market as a present.As soon as I returned to New York, I put my blue scarf in the mail and sent it to the family in Sweden. I wanted them to know I would be back.The Majids desperately wanted to get Nabih to a hospital in Sweden or Canada or the United States, where they thought he might receive better treatment. I consulted with my brother-in-law Kenneth Miller, a leukemia doctor at Tufts, who it turned out had trained one of the specialists, Yener Koc, working on the case. They did excellent work, my brother-in-law said; the survival rate at the Turkish hospital was as good as at any in Europe.But Nabih\u2019s condition worsened. He needed a bone-marrow transplant, and no one in the family was a perfect match. The hospital was capable of doing a partially matched transplant, but it was risky, my brother-in-law said. He had chosen not to do them. \u201cYou mean the boy could die?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere are things worse than death,\u201d he said, describing the tortuous side effects he had seen in patients who survived such a transplant.Nabih received a partial transplant from Amina, his aunt, on May 18, and at first, everything seemed to go well. The graft took. The cancer was eradicated.Relief was short-lived. Soon after the transplant, Rezan\u2019s 9-month-old baby, also named Nabih, choked to death in his crib. Rezan returned to Afrin. I looked at the worry beads he gave me and thought about how young and innocent he was. I wondered if the baby\u2019s death had changed him.In Sweden, the sick boy\u2019s sister, Widad, tried to pave the way for the rest of her family to follow. She and a cousin joined a local soccer team. One night after practice, the team jogged down to the beach and jumped into the water. \u201cThe soccer is opening new doors,\u201d her Swedish guardian, Christer Jansson, wrote to me in June.On Friday, 51 days after Nabih\u2019s transplant, Ahmad posted an image of his residency permit on Facebook. In a good mood, he sent me three pictures of his baby, Farida, born two months after they arrived in Sweden, her face, plump arms and bare chest smeared with chocolate. Farida had discovered Nutella.My friend Johanna Grussner, a jazz singer who has become the guardian of an Afghan refugee boy, agreed to help Ahmad find an apartment in the big city \u2014 maybe Karlstad or Stockholm \u2014 where job prospects were better.Now that he was legal, Ahmad wanted to get a visa to take Widad to visit her brother in Turkey.They had been speaking to the family in Turkey every day, and were told that some days Nabih was \u201ca little better,\u201d others worse. At this point, he had been on a respirator for two weeks; my brother-in-law told me that this was the end stage, but the family was in denial.On Monday, at 5:43 a.m. New York time, I received an email from Akif Yesilipek, chief of the pediatric stem cell transplantation unit at the hospital in Antalya. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the email said, \u201cwe lost Nabih two hours ago.\u201d Dr. Yesilipek went on to explain that the boy died of complications, including graft-versus-host disease, connected to the transplant.Advertisement"}

Twice \u00addivorced, with two grown daughters \u2014 one in college, the other \u201cone of those educated, New Age, stay-at-home supermoms who does everything, including working at home as a technical writer for Apple\u201d \u2014 she suffers from a common strain of middle-class, middle-aged inertia. Single and bored with her job, she nevertheless feels she\u2019s too old to make a meaningful change. The highlight of her week is Friday night, which finds her chatting up the young pizza delivery guy and watching \u201cLaw & Order: Criminal Intent.\u201dOne day Georgia discovers that the father of a new patient was one of her friends with benefits in college. When she learns he has since died in a car crash, she\u2019s overcome with grief and regret: \u201cI should\u2019ve told Ray I loved him before he graduated. I should\u2019ve taken the risk of finding out he didn\u2019t love me.\u201dThis news rouses Georgia from her lethargy. She resolves to track down all the men she once loved to tell them how she really felt and thank them for the roles they\u2019ve played in her life. To do this, she plans to put her cool house in the Oakland hills on the market and take a long train trip across Canada, in the process figuring out what to do with her life.That in the age of Google it takes about two minutes to find almost anyone is irrelevant to the novel\u2019s loose narrative. Georgia possesses the usual (hilarious) very-late-adopter awkwardness with social media, so it takes her until midway through the book to roll up her sleeves and do some serious drunken Facebook stalking. It hardly matters, because McMillan\u2019s true subject has always been the bonds between women, and Georgia\u2019s newfound determination to remake her life provides plenty of grist for boisterous discussions with her best friends, Wanda and Violet.McMillan, justifiably celebrated for her wisecracking dialogue, also pokes some fun at midlife reinvention. It\u2019s never as easy as Oprah makes it out to be. Just as Georgia\u2019s about to put her house on the market, her younger daughter drops out of N.Y.U. after a bad breakup and stumbles home. Then Georgia\u2019s business partner needs time off to tend to ailing parents, leaving Georgia to run the practice rather than take off on her cross-country adventure. Added to the mix are a few surprise pregnancies.Janis Joplin once described herself as passionate and sloppy, and the same could be said of \u201cI Almost Forgot About You.\u201d McMillan falls back on dialogue a little too often. For every sharp and well-\u00adobserved paragraph about the challenges of aging, or wise reflection on the unexpected benefits of a failed marriage, there are too many long, overstuffed expository conversations. In addition, seemingly important story lines are introduced, including a possible foreclosure, then simply evaporate, as if the author lost interest.For fans of McMillan, and they\u2019re legion, these shortcomings won\u2019t spoil anything.

{"Headline": "Dhaka Victims Were a Diverse Group of Global Citizens", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byHere is what we know about the victims.Simona Monti, 33, moved to Dhaka in September, but was thinking of moving back to Italy because she was pregnant. It would have been a difficult decision. She loved her hometown, Magliano Sabina, just north of Rome, but had left to find a job, said Alfredo Graziani, the town\u2019s mayor, who had known Ms. Monti.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t possible to stay here, to have a life,\u201d Mr. Graziani said. \u201cThere is no work for young people, even those of great quality.\u201dMs. Monti, who spoke four languages and had previously worked in France, Spain, China and Peru, had been working in the textile industry. She was \u201cmarvelous, full of life,\u201d Mr. Graziani said.\u201cI spoke to her at Easter. She was happy, she liked her work, but she missed Italy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she had found work, she would have returned.\u201dPatrizia D\u2019Antona told the Italian broadcaster RAI news that the last time she had talked with Claudia, her sister, they had spoken of car insurance and contracts. They did not speak of the possible dangers of living in Bangladesh.\u201cWe never spoke of terrorism,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Antona said. \u201cThey took precautions, but then they were never in an emergency situation.\u201dClaudia D\u2019Antona, 56, lived in Dhaka with her husband, Giovanni Boschetti, who survived because he had been called away by a phone call. When the attack started, he hid and called the Italian Embassy, which sent help, he told his sister-in-law. Mr. Boschetti said he had searched Dhaka\u2019s hospitals for his wife, before being told that she had been killed.Claudia D\u2019Antona had lived in India and Bangladesh for 18 years, her sister said. She said the couple \u201chad dined at that restaurant because they felt safe there, because of where it was, close to the embassy, where they were married.\u201dMarco Tondat, 39, was supposed to return to Cordovado, a town in northern Italy, on Monday, three days after the attack, his brother Fabio said.\u201cMy brother was a good man, very resourceful, with a great desire to live,\u201d Mr. Tondat said.\u201cHe left a year ago for this adventure, because it\u2019s difficult to find work here. So he set off on an adventure, and unfortunately this is the epilogue.\u201dVincenzo D\u2019Allestro, 46, was traveling in Bangladesh, said Raffaele Lettieri, the mayor of Acerra, near Naples, where Mr. D\u2019Allestro lived with his wife, Maria Assunta Gaudio.She was \u201cdistraught with grief,\u201d Mr. Lettieri said. \u201cShe still can\u2019t believe what happened.\u201dMs. Gaudio usually traveled with her husband, Mr. Lettieri said, but this time he had traveled alone.Nadia Benedetti, 52, had been living in Bangladesh for 25 years. She bonded quickly with Ms. Monti. They were part of a close-knit group of about 200 Italians living in Dhaka.\u201cIt\u2019s a small community. We are all very close \u2014 we\u2019re more like a family,\u201d said Tullio Ferri, an Italian who lives in Dhaka and was a friend of eight of the nine Italian victims. \u201cWe are all about the same age, between 45 and 55, and many of us went two or three decades ago. We grew up together professionally.\u201dMr. Hyder called her contributions to Bangladesh \u201cremarkable.\u201dAdele Puglisi, 54, from Catania, Sicily, had for years managed the Dhaka office of a large Italian company that makes children\u2019s clothes.\u201cShe had a smile for everyone,\u201d Sebastiano Costanzo, a childhood friend, said. \u201cShe was so amicable that she made friends everywhere she went.\u201dMs. Puglisi started working abroad more than 15 years ago. When she came back to Sicily once or twice a year, she \u201cnever forgot to call up her friends to meet up, even briefly,\u201d Mr. Costanzo said.She had planned to visit the weekend after she was killed, and her friends had organized a big dinner.Mr. Costanzo said Ms. Puglisi had loved her job, but had started feeling the fatigue of constant traveling.\u201cWho knows, maybe she\u2019d have decided to retreat here sooner or later,\u201d he said.Cristian Rossi, 47, was an entrepreneur from Feletto Umberto, a small town near Udine in northern Italy. He lived in Bangladesh for about 15 years before returning to Italy. He was on one of his occasional trips back on business, because he continued to import clothing from a Dhaka factory. He was married and the father of twin 3-year-old daughters.Maria Rivoli, 33, from the Bergamo area of northern Italy, was the mother of a 3-year-old. She worked in textiles and was on a business trip.Claudio Cappelli, 45, lived in the northern town of Barzan\u00f3, near Monza, his parish priest, the Rev. Giuseppe Scattolin, said on Italian television. He was an entrepreneur in the apparel business and left behind a wife and a daughter, Stella, 6.Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani reported from Rome.\u201cThe brilliance of living,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDancing and flying together in an even world.\u201dIn an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Agnese Barolo, an Italian resident in Dhaka, said she had been dining with the Italian ambassador when the guard alerted him that he had heard gunshots from the nearby restaurant. From her conversation with an Italian survivor, she said the three students had been dining in the garden when the attackers stormed in and ordered them to go inside.\u201cThey started to cry. They didn\u2019t want to\u201d go inside, she told the newspaper.\u201cToday, we remember each of the victims for their contributions as students and citizens of the world,\u201d the school said. \u201cThey were all incredibly gifted in their own way and we mourn their loss.\u201dLiam Stack and Katie Rogers reported from New York.Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, expressed anger that development workers had been targeted.\u201cThe victims were doing everything they could for Bangladesh,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m full of indignation at this unforgivable terrorist act.\u201dKoyo Ogasawara, 56, was an environmental impact assessment expert for Katahira & Engineers International. He previously spent four years in Kenya working on an expressway project there, according to NHK, Japan\u2019s national broadcaster.

{"Headline": "Part-Time Jobs and Thrift: How Unpaid Interns in D.C. Get By", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Dominic Peacock found out he had been selected for an unpaid summer internship at the National Congress of American Indians here, he looked up the airfare from Albuquerque, rejected the option, and boarded a bus and rode 44 hours.Now, after a long day thumbing through bills and working for legislation to protect tribal artifacts, he walks a few blocks to a hotel restaurant where he buses tables until 1 a.m. His workweek \u2014 60 to 75 hours long \u2014 affords him one day off to catch up on chores in his American University dorm room and explore the city.\u201cThis is the schedule that I want,\u201d said Mr. Peacock, a senior at the University of New Mexico and member of the Acoma Pueblo tribe. \u201cI\u2019m going to finish this. I don\u2019t care what it costs.\u201dThousands of interns like Mr. Peacock have descended on the nation\u2019s capital, hoping to gain connections and work experience answering phones, sorting mail and occasionally helping with larger projects in congressional offices, federal institutions, nonprofits and legal divisions across the city.Such interns may cost their employers nothing, but some economists worry such programs do carry a cost. Free labor could be depressing wages in Washington while turning the federal government and Capitol Hill into arenas where only wealthy students can afford to work. In turn, children of privilege get another leg up on their less fortunate classmates.\u201cIf your parents are living paycheck to paycheck, how are you going to do it?\u201d said Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that focuses on labor and economic issues. \u201cIt restricts access to jobs in government to a narrower group of people.\u201d\u201cThe costs of living in the intern capitals \u2014 New York, Los Angeles, D.C. \u2014 are beyond the reach of most low-income and even middle-income students,\u201d she wrote last year.And people willing to take unpaid internships do not necessarily parlay that selflessness into success. The survey also showed that almost 60 percent of paid federal interns received full-time job offers when their internships ended, while nearly 40 percent of the unpaid interns were hired on permanently.For those working in Washington gratis, a little help from the parents goes a long way. Courtney Schneider, an unpaid intern for Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, saved up money from her job at the Clemson University recreation center pool and now takes weekend shifts as a lifeguard in the Northern Virginia suburb where she grew up. But her parents, a private school admissions director and a global controls manager at Exxon Mobil, pay her rent.\u201cI definitely think it would be more difficult without some kind of help,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cEveryone I know has to get help from family or a scholarship.\u201dInterns connect at mixers and online in Facebook groups, and Washington embraces these students with its bars, monuments, museums \u2014 and even paddleboarding on the Potomac River.Bars and clubs cater to the summer flood of students with discounted drinks or cover charges for interns who show their badges at the door. Even with intern-friendly deals, though, going out in the city can strain a student\u2019s budget, said Zachary Feldmann, a sales intern at the power tool manufacturing company Hilti.\u201cLiving in D.C. was on my bucket list,\u201d said Mr. Feldmann, a graduate student studying business at the University of Maryland. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I could put down roots here just because it\u2019s so expensive.\u201dSome students think they know exactly what to expect during their Washington internship, only to be surprised by the city. Rachel Molsberry, a law student at the University of Minnesota, expected a tougher town when she arrived in May to intern for the general counsel\u2019s office at the National Institutes of Health.\u201cIt shocked me how nice everybody is here,\u201d said Ms. Molsberry, who will graduate from law school next year. \u201cYou hear about the East Coast attitude, but I haven\u2019t experienced that at all.\u201dWhen Mr. Peacock is not at his internship or busing tables, he likes to visit the Lincoln Memorial because it reminds him of his tribe\u2019s history. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln officially recognized the sovereignty of several Pueblo tribes in New Mexico for the first time. Mr. Peacock said the monument reminds him of the importance of his home in the \u201csky city,\u201d a collection of Acoma homes built atop a mesa.A striver now, Mr. Peacock said he hopes his summer of sometimes 70-hour workweeks will help him gain an edge when he applies to law school after graduation. He worked as an intern in Washington last fall, as well, and said he really wanted to return to the National Congress of American Indians for the summer even though he knew he would have to work long hours to pay his way.\u201cIf you really work hard then you\u2019re going to be victorious,\u201d Mr. Peacock said. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m doing something that benefits the tribe, that\u2019s O.K. with me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A few days later, he reached out to her through their friend\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cI wanted to flirt with her,\u201d he said. \u201cI friended her on Facebook to try to ask her out for coffee or a drink.\u201dThat initial message surprised Ms. Dutton, but she didn\u2019t make much of it.\u201cI was a bit na\u00efve when he first reached out,\u201d Ms. Dutton said. She remembered calling another friend, Jamie Isaia, and telling her how Mr. Nichtern had asked her out for coffee and how sweet she thought that was.In a very un-Zenlike manner, Ms. Isaia responded, \u201cHoney, he doesn\u2019t want to be your friend.\u201dBefore responding to his friend request, Ms. Dutton went through his Facebook profile and tried to put together whether Mr. Nichtern had had a girlfriend recently, and the answer seemed to be no.After about a month of banter on Facebook and through text messaging, they had their first date, dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and it was pretty much kismet.\u201cShe got my jokes, but that doesn\u2019t mean she necessarily thought they were funny,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to explain my references or my humor to her.\u201cShe brings a California-meets-New-York-art-fashion-world sweet sharpness to analyzing culture and spirituality. Honestly, it helps me not take my meditation and Buddhist practice too seriously, which is a really great thing.\u201dMs. Dutton disappointed her co-workers, who had become used to being entertained by tales of the terrible first dates she had endured. \u201cThis time when I came back, everyone was gearing up for another funny story, like another tale of Marissa\u2019s dating drama,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I almost burst into tears. I felt like, \u2018I think I found my person.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI was looking for someone who was centered and grounded and real,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that in New York we get fooled a lot by people who are trying to be something they\u2019re not, or trying to social climb. He wasn\u2019t looking for me to get him anywhere.\u201dBut he did move somewhere (to her Williamsburg apartment) after just three months. She had been practicing meditation for years, but she took only what is known as a vow of refuge in Buddhism after meeting Mr. Nichtern.\u201cI think that what binds us is that we both have a pretty serious meditative side, but we\u2019re both working in New York City,\u201d Mr. Nichtern said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re both trying to figure out how to be mindful people in this crazy world.\u201dWhile the transition to living together was generally smooth, there were instances when their powers of meditation were put to good use. \u201cEthan definitely has his aesthetics and how he likes things, but I don\u2019t think he is as particular or as fixated on things as I am,\u201d Ms. Dutton said. \u201cThe forks have to be in sideways, and certain jars have to be facing a certain way in the cabinet. He said: \u2018Why? I just don\u2019t understand why.\u2019 \u201dThat fastidiousness initially put Mr Nichtern on edge: \u201cI remember feeling, \u2018Oh, does she think I\u2019m incompetent right now?\u2019 I remember feeling that sort of fear.\u201dBut meditation helped him get past that. \u201cYou open up to say, \u2018Wait, what are they trying to do right now?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think for an intimate relationship, actually staying connected to what the other person\u2019s intention rather than an assumption is really important.\u201d\u201cSometimes you find out if the person\u2019s intention is not that compassionate,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not just Pollyanna.\u201dIn Ms. Dutton\u2019s case, he said, her intentions were \u201cincredibly good.\u201d\u201cShe just likes things organized in certain ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about having things my way, it was about the fear of being perceived as incompetent in my own organizational or aesthetics skills. Once I could recognize that, it was a million times easier to let her have things her way, because at the end of the day, the way she likes things is better. She thinks about these things in an insightful way.\u201dThey were married June 18 on the grassy expanse at Shadow Lawn, a historic farmstead in High Falls, N.Y. Sharon Salzberg, a Buddhist teacher and author, officiated.During the ceremony, Katie Down, a musician seated on a blanket, played several instruments including a set of singing bowls made of quartz that rang like celestial bells when struck with a mallet; a shruti box, a harmonium-like instrument; and a monolina, a kind of hammer dulcimer.Ms. Salzberg and others discussed the six \u201cperfections,\u201d actions that, if cultivated, lead to a more fulfilling life. In Shambhala Buddhism they are meditation, generosity, discipline, patience, joyful effort and wisdom.Myra and Roger Dutton, the bride\u2019s parents, whose marriage of 44 years may well make them experts on the topic, were chosen to discuss patience.Mr. Nichtern\u2019s father talked about wisdom as a \u201cnative intelligence\u201d that one can use to clearly see what\u2019s really happening \u2014 a useful skill for a couple.Janice Ragland, the groom\u2019s mother, spoke of discipline as \u201cbuilding step by step a relationship, home and family that is kind and nurturing.\u201dA week or so after the ceremony, the groom, who is writing a memoir about Buddhism, meditation and relationships, was reminded of his earlier take on rom-coms, and asked to expound a bit about the \u201cinteresting\u201d part of relationships that begin where the stories in those films ended.\u201cWe have this phrase in Shambhala, \u2018cool boredom,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt refers to a space where not much new is happening, but you really appreciate your senses, your connections to others and the present moment. A committed relationship includes a lot of familiarity and repetition, and I think cool boredom is a great phrase to describe how you have to practice after the credits roll, so to speak.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the ability to appreciate each other when there isn\u2019t a huge plot moment, you probably aren\u2019t going to last long. In meditation, you get to practice cool boredom with yourself. In a relationship you get to practice it even more powerfully with another person. I really like getting bored with Marissa.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strategy to Build Police-Citizen Trust", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byFixesFirst of two articlesThe horrors of the last few weeks \u2014 eight police officers assassinated, at least two more unarmed black men to add to a long list of those killed by police \u2014 have produced increasingly desperate calls for unity and understanding. How can Americans build empathy and trust between their police and their minority communities? How can they stop the killings? And is there a way to do this while reducing crime?On July 17, Eric Jones, the police chief in Stockton, Calif., spoke at Progressive Community Church, an African-American church on Stockton\u2019s south side. On Sunday evening, people from three different churches gathered at Progressive to talk about police-community relations. The police department streamed the speech live on Facebook, where it has 94,000 followers.Jones talked about the murdered police officers. But his real subject was black lives, not blue ones. \u201cThere was a time where police were used to be dispatched to keep lynchings \u2018civil,\u2019 \u201d said Jones, who is white. \u201cThe badge we wear still does carry the burden, and we need to at least understand why those issues are still deep-rooted in a lot of our communities.\u201d And injustice continues, he said: \u201cWe know that there are disparities in arrests and shootings across the country.\u201dStockton was devastated in the 2008 recession. A quarter of the police force was laid off. The unemployment rate soared to over 20 percent by 2011, twice the national average. The city, with 300,000 people, has been one of America\u2019s 20 most violent ever since.But the force, now back to nearly its former size, is known as one trying to do something \u2014 about crime, and about creating a different relationship with the community. These are related, said Jones, who became chief in 2012.\u201cTraditionally, we\u2019d go into a neighborhood with a highly visible police patrol and zero-tolerance enforcement,\u201d Jones said in an interview. \u201cThat did reduce crime \u2014 but only for a brief time, and at great cost to community trust.\u201d He decided that winning trust was crucial.\u201cWe will never impact violent crime the way we need to if we\u2019re not gaining community trust in the work we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said at the church. \u201cIt makes our job safer, we solve more crime and we are legitimate and credible in the eyes of the community.\u201dTom R. Tyler, now a professor at Yale Law School, first framed the idea in his 1990 book, \u201cWhy People Obey the Law.\u201d He wrote that people obey the law not because they fear punishment, as commonly thought. They obey it largely because they believe the authorities have the right to tell them what to do; in other words, the law has legitimacy.And what gives the law legitimacy is how people are treated. \u201cWhat people actually pay attention to when assessing behavior of people in legal authority is not how good they are in reducing crime or whether they get a ticket,\u201d said Tracey Meares, also a professor at Yale Law School and a leading researcher of, and advocate for, procedural justice. \u201cWhat people care about is how they\u2019re treated and how they\u2019re treated in particular ways.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t learn this in the first instance from social science literature,\u201d Kennedy continued. \u201cYou learn it from your mother.\u201dJones began to try new approaches. The force began to work closely with clergy and the community. Then Jones learned about procedural justice. The Chicago Police Department had developed a course and was training all its officers. Stockton sent three officers to take the course, and then three more.Stockton adapted Chicago\u2019s curriculum and began training officers, cadets in the police academy and other members of the community.The course has had two parts so far (Part 3, on implicit bias, starts next month). Part 1 covers basic principles, and the effects on officers of a constantly hostile relationship with the community \u2014 the stress, burnout and cynicism. That lesson gets particularly high marks from trainees, said Capt. Scott Meadors, who runs the training.Perhaps surprisingly, so does a lesson on the history of police-minority relations. There\u2019s a photo tour of law enforcement\u2019s hall of shame: lynchings, internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II, Stonewall, Rodney King and Abner Louima, among others. There\u2019s George Wallace on the steps of the Alabama capitol in 1963 shouting \u201csegregation forever!\u201d \u201cAnd who\u2019s standing next to him?\u201d said Meadors. \u201cWe are. Law enforcement. Most of our officers weren\u2019t born then, but we inherited that history, and we have to understand that.\u201dPart 2 applies the idea to what police face on the job. For example: Police officers have typically dismissed residents trying to enter a blocked-off street with a terse \u201cYou can\u2019t go there.\u201d The course teaches them to say instead something like: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a report of an armed person in the neighborhood. Let us sort this out and you can get back to your house. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201dThe trainers also talk about something that happened to one of them, Sgt. Gary Benevides. A man having a mental health crisis had barricaded himself in a car and was revving the engine. Other police officers had been unable to persuade him to come out. Benevides, however, had met the man a few weeks before, and used that connection \u2014 forged in a brief but positive exchange \u2014 to get him to abandon the car.I asked Meadors how the police would traditionally have handled the situation. \u201cWe would negotiate, negotiate and negotiate and create that connection,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s very difficult if every encounter a person ever had with the police is negative.\u201dTraining is the easy part. It\u2019s much harder to integrate new ideas into the day-to-day running of the department. Stockton is trying. The department is overhauling its general orders and incorporating procedural justice, said Joseph Silva, the department spokesman. And officers\u2019 evaluations, which affect promotions and transfers, now include how well they use the strategy.A neighborhood impact team of chaplains and officers now goes into a community the day after a traumatic or otherwise significant event, knocking on doors to talk to residents about what happened, and other community issues. Silva said that in addition to improving relations, such outreach has led to tips from residents who didn\u2019t want to be seen coming up to an officer at a crime scene.The department also employs four strategic community officers, each assigned to a single neighborhood. One is Sonia Diaz, who spends her days in Sierra Vista, a public-housing project.Diaz grew up about 40 miles from Stockton, in a largely Hispanic area where all the police were white and didn\u2019t speak Spanish. Her brothers were repeatedly stopped, she said. When she was 12 she was standing in front of her house with a friend, and a sheriff asked the girls if they were prostituting. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what it was,\u201d she said.Diaz responds to call about criminal activity in Sierra Vista, but her main job is building a relationship between the community and the police. She has time to talk to people. One morning last week, a group of children excitedly showed her their scooter tricks; she gave them stickers.\u201cWhen I started in January, nobody would talk to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t wave at me. I\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, how are you guys doing,\u2019 and they would scatter. It took about four months to develop that relationship.\u201d She said that now, tenants stop her to ask for help with problems like child custody and a brother\u2019s mental health issues.The research on procedural justice suggests that such changes could have significant impact. In minority communities, it is important in itself to reduce the sense that police are an army of occupation.Still, although Stockton is probably among the handful of police departments in the country that are doing the most thorough job of implementing procedural justice, it continues to have one of the country\u2019s highest rates of violent crime. (Unlike many other cities, however, it did not see a rise in homicides last year.) The training module used all over the country is known as the Chicago model. Yet the Chicago police department itself is a model for no one right now.There is crime. There is police brutality. But that doesn\u2019t mean procedural justice is a failure, or not worth doing. We cannot yet see its impact at a city level. But many factors govern police behavior, and even more govern crime. Some of these are extraordinarily powerful and hard to change. I\u2019ll look at this next week.Advertisement"}

While it stops short of the full encryption that other messaging services like WhatsApp have adopted, it gives Messenger a heightened mode of security that Facebook hopes will attract global audiences to download the app.\u201cThe fact that we have 1.65 billion people on Facebook already makes Messenger the best live, self-updating address book in the world,\u201d Mr. Marcus said in an interview. \u201cBecause of the scale of our network, I feel like we really have a shot at this.\u201dThe moves put Facebook Messenger increasingly into competition with messaging apps that have risen to prominence in their particular regions or countries. WeChat, the mobile messaging app owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, dominates China. Kakao, another app, is widely used throughout South Korea, while the Line smartphone app is popular in Japan.\u201cJust look at how successful WeChat has become for Tencent,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson, an internet analyst with eMarketer. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of ubiquity Facebook wants to achieve with Messenger.\u201dEven as Messenger has been drawing new users, it has yet to make money. The app is free to download and Mr. Zuckerberg has said Facebook typically does not try to generate revenue until a service has a billion users.A recent American Express Messenger bot, for instance, may send someone a Facebook message with restaurant recommendations for a city they have recently bought plane tickets to visit using their American Express card. The CNN bot sends news stories based on topics a user is interested in. Airline service bots could handle customer problems in one thread.Some of Messenger\u2019s early bot offerings have been criticized as half-baked and underdeveloped. Facebook said that while early versions of bots may not be as impressive as the hype, more than 21,000 developers have signed up to develop bots since the platform\u2019s introduction.Adding more encryption with secret conversations, which Facebook plans to roll out widely by the end of the summer, is aimed at coaxing people to use the service for more communication. Someone could set a message to disappear after a period of time, which may make them more willing to exchange personal information with a company\u2019s customer service representative on Messenger. People have to opt in to use secret conversations, the company said.To keep Messenger\u2019s momentum going, Mr. Marcus said he expected the fast pace of product releases for the app to continue.\u201cTo make Messenger your preferred and primary communication platform, we have to build capabilities different from anyone else,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Day 4", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementCLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump has said and done many offensive things during his presidential campaign, but the greatest insult was his overarching motive. With every boast about his poll numbers, every celebration of his victory margins and every sorting of the world into winners like him and losers like just about everybody else, he seemed to be on something other than a political quest or civic mission. It was pure ego trip. I suspect it still is. But what was most striking about his remarks on the final night of the Republican National Convention was the way in which they sought to refute that very notion. They were much, much, much too long, as if he were trying to prove his worthiness for the presidency with sheer oratorical stamina. They rambled. But they recognized that perhaps the tallest obstacle between him and the White House isn\u2019t his lack of experience or even his recklessness but his epic and all-too-obvious narcissism. When Americans go to the polls, it\u2019s not the final episode of the kind of reality show that he once starred in, nor is it the final minutes of the kind of beauty pageant that he once owned. They\u2019re not bestowing a crown. They\u2019re electing a leader, someone who can ideally soothe their anxieties and improve their lives. Is Trump finally and fully getting that? His speech suggested so. It wasn\u2019t an adolescent frenzy of self-congratulation like last Saturday\u2019s unhinged introduction of Mike Pence as his running mate. In its straightforward, unadorned sentences, \u201cI\u201d ceded plenty of space to \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cwe.\u201d It even went so far as to turn the tables, casting Hillary Clinton as the candidate on a gilded path of self-aggrandizement. \u201cMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt reads: \u2018I\u2019m With Her.\u2019 I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \u2018I\u2019m with you, the American people.\u2019 I am your voice.\u201d \u201cI am with you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI will fight for you. And I will win for you.\u201d Winning was still his obsession, but it was framed as an act of altruism. Thus the inveterate braggart became the humble servant, or at least tried to restyle himself that way. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see if the makeover takes and a man who lost control of Cleveland can gain control of himself. The fiercest blast of energy came from Ted Cruz\u2019s flamboyant snub of Trump. And the second biggest story was the plagiarism in Melania Trump\u2019s tribute to her husband. Day after day, disruptions and distractions eclipsed whatever the message was supposed to be. \u201cThe people\u2019s champion,\u201d said his daughter Ivanka Trump, who introduced him \u2014 and who assured Americans that they don\u2019t really understand him. She vouched for him as \u201ccolorblind and gender-neutral\u201d and said that what he taught her and her siblings was that they \u201ceach had a responsibility to work not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world.\u201d Much of Trump\u2019s speech was familiar and expected, underscoring a Nixonian strategy to win the White House by stoking Americans\u2019 fears. He painted an almost unbearably dark portrait of a country reeling from lawlessness \u2014 he emphasized illegal immigration in particular \u2014 and a world stalked by terrorists. He placed some of the blame for that jihadist terror at his Democratic opponent\u2019s feet. \u201cThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be America\u2019s legacy.\u201d He invoked her emails and excoriated her ethics. But in other ways, his speech was a departure, for the convention as well as for him. Although prior nights focused on reassuring staunch conservatives that they could trust Trump, he in a few passages sought to reassure other Americans that he stood for them as well. He remembered the \u201c49 wonderful Americans\u201d who were shot dead in a gay nightclub in Orlando and pledged to protect the \u201cL.G.B.T.Q. community,\u201d laboring over the politically correct cluster of consonants. When the delegates in the convention hall applauded that, he digressed from his prepared remarks to acknowledge it. \u201cI have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said,\u201d Trump told them. This was less a general-election pivot than a general-election lunge. But his most remarkable course correction was away from a perverse fixation on the glory of Donald Trump. At the beginning of the speech, when he did indulge one of his customary brags about his vote count in the Republican primaries, he shared the credit, referring to what \u201cwe\u201d accomplished, meaning him and his supporters, and putting asterisks around that pronoun. \u201cI say \u2018we\u2019 because we are a team,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cEvery day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.\u201d \u201cThese are people who work hard but no longer have a voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI am your voice.\u201d Trump may be a master salesman, but can he really sell that? Trump, whose buildings are billboards on which he can write his name in big, gold letters? Trump, whose entrepreneurial energy has gone into luxe resorts with luxe golf courses? Trump, who has profited from so many ventures that left others diminished? I\u2019m doubtful. But I\u2019m impressed that someone who used a debate to assure us of his prodigious manhood kept his vanity so zipped. Ivanka Trump glided onstage to the Beatles\u2019 \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d It was apt. She was sun-kissed, her blond hair perfectly sleek, blowing photogenically, no doubt from a fan in the podium. The fashion entrepreneur\u2019s blush-pink sheath and stilettos looked Fifth Avenue chic. The 34-year-old ornament to the Trump brand was like a beautiful sunny morning in the midst of a dark, lashing hailstorm. She was glossy, both in how she looked and how she spoke. She glossed over all of her father\u2019s ugly rhetoric and incitements, his erratic behavior and lack of any policy depth or even any policy, and offered a gauzy, idealized vision of a Bobby Kennedy-style figure as her father channeled Richard Nixon in \u201968. She hailed her dad as a fighter against injustice, a boss who is \u201ccolorblind and gender neutral,\u201d who hires people of all ethnicities and backgrounds. She glossed over the entire ideology of the G.O.P. and the regressive party platform for women and presented her father as a feminist who fights for women in the Trump organization and who would fight as president for child care, \u201caffordable and accessible for all,\u201d and for women\u2019s rights, equal pay and maternity leave. \u201cI will fight for this, too, right alongside him,\u201d she said, serving, once more, as the classy conjurer of the Moderate, Sane Donald in place of the Dark, Ugly Donald. One impediment to joy, as Ivanka tried to channel Hillary: The Boston Globe\u2019s Matt Viser reported last month that men in the Trump campaign earn about 35 percent more than the women in his campaign. Trump would never make the eat-your-peas pivot to professionalism, comity and civility, so Ivanka did it for him. She called her father \u201cthe people\u2019s champion\u201d and \u201cthe people\u2019s nominee,\u201d making him sound like Princess Diana, the people\u2019s princess. She offered sweet anecdotes to personalize her father, but she was so sunny that her portrait of him was almost unrecognizable. More like a jolly Santa than a short-fingered vulgarian. She said she remembered him, when she was a child playing with Legos in the corner of his skyscraper office, tearing stories out of the newspaper about someone facing some injustice or hardship and writing a note in his black felt-tip pen to find the person and have them brought to Trump Tower, where he could get in their corner when they were down and give them a job or a break until they could feel that life is great again. She said her father had \u201cempathy and generosity,\u201d and threw in \u201ckindness and compassion\u201d for good measure. Hopes are often reposed in family members. Everyone hoped that Barbara Bush was secretly working to make H.W. Bush more liberal on choice issues. Everyone hoped that Laura Bush was secretly working on W. to get Donald Rumsfeld fired. But Ivanka Trump has a stupefyingly harder task. Everyone is hoping that with her calm and gracious air, she is secretly working to turn Donald Trump into a completely different being, to make him stop acting self-destructive and crazy and nasty. She offers herself as that bright promise. But, as much as she might try to steer her willful father, we know that it is not really possible to curb his impulsiveness and narcissism or to moderate and modernize his positions. He is too in thrall to the roar of the crowd, too old to develop impulse control. So it just turns her into a fabulous fabulist. She said her father advised her when she was growing up: \u201cIvanka, if you\u2019re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\u201d And what can be bigger thinking than making the most divisive, disliked candidate in modern history seem like noble Atticus Finch \u2014 though it would be hard to imagine Atticus saying, as Donald Trump once did of his own daughter, that he would like to date a full-grown Scout if she weren\u2019t, in fact, his daughter. She said he taught his kids to have a moral compass \u2013 with a straight face. Ivanka has, at times, played the charming sidekick to Trump in his more unsavory business dealings. In 2006, she helped sell spots in a future Baja California condo complex that bore the Trump name. While the Trump organization earned $500,000 for their branding and sales efforts, all the people convinced by her and her father\u2019s promises lost their money when the outside developer failed to build anything. She denied any fault, telling CBS News that her family had \u201clived up to our obligation under a license agreement.\u201d The 2016 Republican platform condemns the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which granted same-sex couples the freedom to marry. It also states that \u201ctraditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society.\u201d But Mr. Brookman said he\u2019d heard a different message from speakers the previous night who talked about the G.O.P. as \u201ca big-tent party.\u201d Elsewhere on the floor, Barbara Paulus, a delegate from Kansas, said her ideal party platform would not mention L.G.B.T. issues, except to say \u201cthat everyone has the same rights as an American.\u201d For Lisenne Dudderar, a delegate from Arkansas, the perfect platform would say nothing on the topic. Later in the evening, the crowd applauded when the venture capitalist Peter Thiel said he was \u201cproud to be gay.\u201d Mr. Brookman, a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, had found convention delegates, including those from conservative states, receptive to his message. He was hopeful that an inclusive spirit would prevail under a Donald Trump presidency. Mr. Trump \u201cis historically very supportive of L.G.B.T. rights,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care as long as you perform.\u201d Mr. Brookman wasn\u2019t always on Team Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t start there but I\u2019m actually very, very excited to end there.\u201d What gives Mr. Thiel such confidence in Mr. Trump? He said he likes Mr. Trump because \u201che is a builder and it\u2019s time to rebuild America,\u201d that he wanted to end \u201cstupid wars.\u201d And he said Mr. Trump understands that fake culture wars are a distraction. He followed that up by saying he was a proud Republican and a proud American, to cheers from the crowd and chants of USA USA USA. Ted Cruz really is Canadian. Because if he were a true Texan, he would know, yes, when to hold \u2019em and when to fold \u2019em. We happened upon the El Paso branch of the Texas delegation at the Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse. The delegates, wearing matching white cowboy hats and red, white and blue shirts with a lone star, were still fit to be tied at Cruz\u2019s withholding convention speech and truculent meeting with them this morning. It was a case of Andrew Marvell irritation: Had we but world enough and time, this coyness, sir, were no crime. Cruz thought his coy, smart-alecky refusal to endorse or even boost Donald Trump in his prime-time speech was a springboard to 2020. Instead, he\u2019s riding a bronco called Trump. If he had wanted to stand on principle and not play patty-cake with Trump like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, many here felt, Cruz should have stayed home. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone commit hara-kiri on national television,\u201d said Mark Dunham. \u201cMr. Cruz, whether he realizes it or not, he turned himself into Omarosa. It was political suicide. I cannot rationalize his thought process other than he\u2019s taking it way too personally and making it more about himself than God and country.\u201d Adolpho Telles, the owner of Rosa\u2019s Cantina in El Paso, agreed: \u201cI am so annoyed with him. He should have accepted what occurred and moved on with his life. You\u2019ve got to support your candidate 100 percent.\u201d The bright side, he said, was that the anger at Cruz had brought the delegates together and distracted them from the worries some have that they are not yet totally in love with their erratic, dictatorial Gotham mogul. Telles was not buying Cruz\u2019s defense this morning to them that he was not \u201ca servile puppy dog\u201d who would tell Trump \u201cthank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\u201d Telles said he was thinking: \u201cThis is not about you or your wife. It\u2019s about Trump. And it\u2019s about America.\u201d An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a member of Donald Trump\u2019s staff. She is Omarosa Manigault, not Amarosa.\nLauren Tamaki is live-illustrating the speech, with your input.\n\u201cThe font is good for you, Dad?\u201d Ms. Trump asked. \u201cFor me it would be great to have it a tiny bit bigger.\u201d \u201cThen you get fewer words,\u201d replied Mr. Trump. The font was left as is. Mr. Trump then read aloud the words on the glass: \u201cFour score and seven years ago \u2026\u201d Presumably he was reading teleprompter dummy copy. Unless he plans to inflict an Abe impersonation on what\u2019s left of the party of Lincoln. CBS News captured this candid video of the Trumps discussing the legibility of the electronic cue cards. And then @CBSNews spun the video as something of a gotcha on Twitter. \u201cWatch as @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump tweak the teleprompter at the #RNCinCLE.\u201d But it\u2019s surprising that this mild video by CBS News could even pass as a Twitter gotcha. The companionable exchange among the engineers and the Trumps is far too benign to qualify for the usual Twitter scrum. But the CBS News video is about as spiky as media coverage has gotten this week, in spite of predictions that the convention coverage would be vertigo. But the convention has also failed to explode in another way. In spite of nervousness over how to cover a fractious convention and anticipated protests, the television networks ended up fitting this year\u2019s unconventional convention into their decades\u2019 old template for event coverage. When dissent among Republican delegates was put down on Day 1, the networks did not themselves dissent or send cameras to follow the disaffected parties out of the room. Instead, they largely put the disruption behind them, and continued to cover Mr. Trump as if there were party consensus about his nomination. Yesterday, Mr. Trump underscored the point suggested by the media\u2019s camerawork: \u201cOther than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is very united. Great love in the arena!\u201d All week off-camera Mr. Trump has been playing media critic, as usual, on Twitter. He tweeted regular praise of Fox News and denigrated CNN and others for biased coverage and low ratings. Mr. Trump\u2019s posts suggest that he never takes his eye off the media, and that he\u2019s prepared, whatever else he\u2019s up to, to smack the wayward ones whenever they get out of line. Is it possible that, just as the mainstream media seems to have tamed social media for now, the Trump campaign has managed to subdue the mainstream media? No doubt Cruz believes that it will help him \u2014 that the party\u2019s many anti-Trumpers will remember his refusal to abase himself, and that enough Trump voters will forgive him if he runs on populist and anti-establishment themes. But there are good reasons to think otherwise, starting with the fact that Cruz couldn\u2019t win this year\u2019s nomination even though he ended up the last man standing against a candidate the party had every reason to reject. If his \u201cvote your conscience\u201d speech cements his standing with many conservatives and wins him strange new respect from anti-Trump moderates, it\u2019s also turned his radio-talker supporters against him and added to his lengthy list of party enemies \u2014 which means that in future presidential cycles it might put a harder ceiling on his support. And throughout Trump\u2019s rise, far too many Republican politicians have gotten lost in this mostly-futile gaming-out of options. From Paul Ryan\u2019s temporizing \u2014 criticize but don\u2019t oppose, withhold your endorsement and then offer it reluctantly \u2014 to Marco Rubio\u2019s #NeverTrump, no, wait, #NeverHillary lurches, there\u2019s been a futile quest for some perfect political balance that keeps every option open and every faction happy, that distances you from Trump in one breath while normalizing with him with the other. That\u2019s what Cruz earned himself last night: not a better chance at the presidency, but a profile in political courage that will be remembered no matter what happens to his political ambitions henceforth. And it\u2019s yet another irony of this most ironic year that it would be the most overtly Machiavellian of Republican politicians who would keep his honor, and pass a test that so many politicians of more conspicuous high-mindedness have failed. Much has been said about Donald Trump\u2019s reputation as a connoisseur of women \u2014 mostly by him. So it is interesting to see which women \u2014 besides the glossy Bond girls in his family \u2014 are stepping up to the podium to give testimonials to the Beauty of Trump. Ordinarily at a Republican convention, you get a lot of pasty-faced white guys droning on about policies that would yank rights away from women. But G.O.P. officials jammed all the Teanderthal \u201cMad Men\u201d stuff in the platform a week ago. The Trump convention is a blithely policy-free zone, \u201cthe ultimate reality show,\u201d as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, called it. Some Washington think tanks even canceled their usual policy seminars. What was the point? In the absence of the usual suspects \u2014 G.O.P. stars and a few A-list celebrities from movies where things get blown up \u2014 a selection of random women have stepped into the void. Convention planners are hoping there has to be another way besides Ivanka to improve Trump\u2019s abysmal favorability numbers with women and to provide some counterprogramming to the harsh calls for execution or imprisonment, or both, of the first woman to head a major party ticket. But delegates sometimes looked a little mystified by the parade of obscure women, some of whom offered no explanation of how or even if they knew Trump. Somehow, in this unorthodox gathering, an avocado farmer and former soap opera actress who won two awards from Soap Opera Digest for being Outstanding Villainess ended up in prime time, standing before a screen the exact color of guacamole in a Trump Tower taco bowl. \u201cMany of you know me from one of your favorite soap operas \u2018The Young and the Restless\u2019 and \u2018The Bold and the Beautiful,\u2019\u201d Kimberlin Brown said, adding that since she had only One Life to Live, she pursued other dreams. Kerry Woolard, the general manager of the Trump Winery, made Trump\u2019s turnaround of the Virginia vineyard sound like Eisenhower at Omaha Beach: \u201cQuickly and decisively,\u201d she said, he went \u201cto work replanting the vines.\u201d We also enjoyed the stylings of Michelle Van Etten, a statuesque blonde with a disjointed speaking style and karate-chop hand motion that seemed to alarm some delegates. Balancing out Trump, called the \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d by Spy magazine, Von Etten has unusually long fingers. She told the traumatic saga of going to her 20th high school reunion. She saw that her former classmates were driving BMWs and \u201clooked like Barbie,\u201d while she was 30 pounds overweight and driving a minivan. \u201cI began to dream again,\u201d she said, adding that she started a fashion business in Florida and \u201cafter two years, I was able to retire my husband\u201d and he was able to home-school their kids. Natalie Gulbis, the 441st best female golfer in the world who was in the second season of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d told the story of how she hit the links once with Trump and he helped her realize her dream of opening a Boys and Girls Club. \u201cThese words previously fell on deaf albeit well-intentioned ears, but that day was different,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cThey finally fell on ears that cared enough to take action.\u201d Trump\u2019s caring ears must have burning. Donald Trump 1) Seems to be a very affectionate father. 2) Did a good job rebuilding that skating rink in Central Park back in the 1980s. 3) Have I mentioned the children? O.K., sorry. He\u2019s a much more pleasant person in private than he seems in public. Hillary Clinton 1) Despite her fame, eagerly spends much of her time interacting with average people under less than glamorous conditions. 2) Had a better health care plan than Barack Obama in 2008. 3) Never folds under pressure. What on earth is BitTorrent News? At this point, it\u2019s no surprise when an organization experiments with ways to use technology to advance the distribution of news. The New York Times is one of many doing so. BitTorrent \u2014 a company based, of course, in San Francisco \u2014 is using news to advance technology. Until fairly recently, BitTorrent didn\u2019t have a news site. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really a website at all. It\u2019s a \u201cprotocol\u201d \u2014 a bunch of software used to transfer files across the internet. BitTorrent\u2019s technology, now about 12 years old, was a success among companies that distribute large amounts of data to large numbers of people at the same time, like Facebook or the online gaming company Blizzard. More notoriously, pirate websites use the technology to offer illegal downloads. Erik Schwartz, a vice president for the company, was quick to say that his company does not offer those services, but its software is open source. After a while, BitTorrent started to focus on video streaming, which is how Netflix delivers movies and TV shows to your computer, and found the available technology lacking. \u201cDuring the 2014 World Cup, we\u2019d be watching ESPN online and Twitter would explode with \u2018GOAL!\u2019 and then you\u2019d watch little guys running around on a soccer field for four minutes until you saw the goal being scored,\u201d Schwartz said. While the future of scripted video programming like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d lies in the kind of on-demand streaming that Netflix offers, sports and news have bigger audiences and have to be offered live. So BitTorrent looked for a live event to test their technology, and along came the 2016 New Hampshire primary. BitTorrent rented some space in the Radisson Hotel in Manchester, N.H., and BitTorrent News was born. The company hired a news director and some young people with video and journalistic experience. Now it has a mini-studio here in Cleveland, next to The Times\u2019s work space, with an on-camera staff and people behind the scenes, like Benjamin Ratner, 24, who said he edited his first video in seventh grade. BitTorrent has bigger ambitions, which do not seem to include Emmy Awards or Pulitzer Prizes. In May, it started a multichannel TV-like application, which is free, for now. In the future, it hopes to provide an alternative to broadcast and cable networks for things like football games or the World Cup. Meanwhile, the BitTorrent team is having fun covering political conventions. I\u2019m a veteran reality-TV producer. In my field, character is everything, and shows work best with a diversity of recognizable character types: the everyman, the alpha female, the clown, the wizard, the villain. Mr. Trump has always played an antihero in the mold of Simon Cowell on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d: a character with flaws, but someone we tune in to see. Reality-TV villains differ from villains in other narrative forms in that they don\u2019t necessarily have a unique agenda \u2014 they don\u2019t want to kill James Bond or destroy Gotham. They want what all the other characters want: to win the competition, to remain on the island, to receive a rose, to be president. What sets them apart are six simple words: \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends.\u201d This could very well be Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign motto. Likewise, Mr. Trump won the Republican primary competition, his strategic alliance with Chris Christie paying dividends against a threatening Marco Rubio. The convention, however, is exposing the vast difference between the reality-TV star and the man who must lead his party and, perhaps, this country. For Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, the experience in Cleveland must be extremely disappointing. Mr. Trump promised a dazzling showbiz convention packed with A-listers from the sports and entertainment world. For an audience raised on the production values of shows like \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the convention, plagued with a glitchy Jumbotron and cringe-worthy Republican dancing in a half-empty arena, has a state-fair vibe. And while Mr. Trump has been immersed in the alternate universe of reality-TV stardom for years, surely he cannot consider the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Willie Robertson, the golfer turned apprentice Natalie Gulbis, or the \u201980s trivia answer Scott Baio to be A-list. On most reality shows, a savvy producer can steer cast members back on track. The Trump show has one fatal flaw: Mr. Trump is producing it himself. And reality-TV villains, by their very nature, are bad at uniting a cast. If the Master Negotiator couldn\u2019t negotiate an endorsement from Ted Cruz, how will he negotiate his promised concessions from America\u2019s allies and enemies? Mr. Trump may yet turn the convention around. He\u2019ll need a good surprise. Something fun and unexpected, like Arnold Schwarzenegger descending a zip-line to introduce him, or Sarah Palin snowmobiling in to save the day. In his big speech, he could humanize himself by opening up about vulnerabilities that he\u2019s heretofore avoided \u2014 the death of his alcoholic brother, his struggles with bankruptcy \u2014 or maybe even his lifelong fight to overcome narcissistic personality disorder. But that\u2019s not Mr. Trump\u2019s character. If nothing else, this convention has given undecided voters a preview of a Trump presidency: divisive, ineffective and designed mainly for ratings. As for Hillary Clinton, her weakness is politics and a penchant for secrecy and self-inflicted injuries, and her strength is policy \u2014 she\u2019s smart as a whip and has a real passion that goes back decades for disadvantaged children, who constitute the single most neglected constituency in America today. Sit down with Clinton, and on this topic she\u2019s a policy wonk able to talk in detail about policies that would help, including home visitation and pre-k. She understands that the key to addressing poverty is to help young children. She also cares deeply about addressing gender inequities around the world \u2014 human trafficking, child marriage, girls pulled out of school \u2014 which to me constitute some of the world\u2019s great injustices. Moreover, although Republicans today despise Clinton and are debating whether it\u2019s best to jail her or shoot her, Clinton had a good record in the Senate and at the State Department of working with Republicans to get things done. For me, the hope of a Hillary Clinton administration is that we might actually make progress in addressing some of the greatest inequities at home and abroad. Holy Cuyahoga, Republicans! \u201cWe don\u2019t just put on red jerseys and blue jerseys,\u201d he told the delegates. \u201cThis is about principles and ideals.\u201d He added that he\u2019s not \u201ca servile puppy dog.\u201d The Texans were yelling. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get over it,\u201d said one. \u201cThis is politics.\u201d \u201cNo, this is not politics,\u201d Mr. Cruz fired back. Maybe he\u2019s got a point \u2014 this is the battle of the Constitutional Conservative vs. the Network TV Star. Don\u2019t go to Essos because you could become a love slave to a Dothraki prince. And stay away from Westeros because Cersei is about to get into some carnage that will make the Republican chaos look like child\u2019s play, and don\u2019t forget winter is here with the Whitewalkers. On an amusing side note, I asked D.B. Weiss, one of the cool creators of the show, whether Trump reminded him of any GOT character. \u201cHodor,\u201d he replied. Ms. Winfrey \u201conce famously asked my father if he envisioned running for the presidency of the United States,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said. \u201cHis answer? \u2018Only if it got so bad that I had no choice.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat day has come.\u201d In that 1988 interview, Donald Trump told Ms. Winfrey he probably wouldn\u2019t run for president. But, he said, \u201cIf it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what\u2019s happening with this country.\u201d The Winfrey interview is now part of Trump lore, serving as evidence that Mr. Trump never sought high office, but is now ready to renounce his business career in service of the people. \u201cTo whom much is given, much will be required,\u201d Eric Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the very belief that compelled my father to make this great sacrifice, to run for the most powerful yet unforgiving office in the world.\u201d Actually, it seems Donald Trump has been willing to make this great sacrifice for some time \u2014 it\u2019s just that this year, he might actually get the chance. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness,\u201d Gov. Pence went on. \u201cHe\u2019s his own man.\u201d Speakers all night had been coyly invoking Mr. Trump\u2019s aggro provocations \u2014 and trying manfully to reframe them. Mr. Pence had begun to practice this art earlier in the week on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d when he used a Trump family default description: \u201cTrump speaks from the heart.\u201d For months, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have been leaning hard on those words to turn his vengefulness and vigilantism into a virtue. Earlier in the day, in an interview with CNN, Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka had protested that her father is neither sexist nor racist. Instead, she said, \u201cHe is authentic.\u201d She went on: \u201cHe\u2019s bold. He\u2019s unabashed.\u201d Showing amused tolerance of bigotry as a foible of a colorful, charismatic, impolite, rough, direct, brutally honest, authentic, bold and unabashed \u2014 but ultimately endearing \u2014 old so-and-so seemed contrived when Mr. Obama tried it. And it seems contrived now. But the sincerity excuse persists. \u201cI speak from here\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump said in June, pointing to his head \u2014 \u201dand from the heart.\u201d On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Pence to discuss their partnership. The go-to phrase surfaced when Mr. Pence was asked why he had once objected to Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on foreign Muslims. After fumbling for a bit, Mr. Pence explained that Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t speak like a politician.\u201d Then, as if cued like one of the hypnotized in \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cHe speaks from the heart.\u201d Casting Mr. Trump\u2019s incitements to xenophobia and violence as heartfelt evidently makes them slightly less terrifying. A through-line of the convention has been to set up a powerful antagonism between \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d the province of the hypocritical, intellectual and weak-willed, and \u201cspeaking from the heart,\u201d as a province of \u2026 Donald Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s children, maybe because they\u2019re naturals to liken him to Mr. Obama\u2019s benign \u201cold uncle,\u201d have especially seized on the power of \u201cfrom the heart\u201d to extenuate almost anything. Revving up to give his speech at the convention tonight, Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric turned the phrase on himself. The speech \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t something I was going to outsource,\u201d he said, perhaps inadvertently slighting other Trumps \u2014 Donald Jr., Melania \u2014 who notably used speechwriters for their own addresses. He concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s just too important to me. I\u2019m going to speak from the heart tonight.\u201d The phrase sounds smarmy. It compromises the Republican Party\u2019s usual claim of hardheadedness over and against the bleeding-heart emotionalism of the other party. But it\u2019s probably the only possible rhetorical move of the Trump campaign. It\u2019s become impossible for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters to lend reason or logic to his vendettas, daft misogyny, thoroughgoing racism and bloodlust. Instead, they advertise it as lovable. \nThe Times columnists discuss Ted Cruz, the developments in Cleveland and answer questions from readers.\nScreaming matches between delegates. Past nominees who refused to attend. Speakers who seem allergic to mentioning the nominee\u2019s name \u2013 or policies. The runner-up refusing to endorse the winner. Plagiarism. Lies about plagiarism. Talk of Lucifer from the stage. Humanizing stories about the nominee relegated to obscure time slots. Multiple speakers calling for the jailing of the opposing nominee. A prominent delegate calling for that nominee\u2019s execution by firing squad. It\u2019s time to ask where the Republican National Convention of 2016 ranks on the list of modern history\u2019s worst political conventions. By worst, I\u2019m not making a moral judgment, though that wouldn\u2019t be kind, either. I\u2019m talking instead about effectiveness \u2013 judging the conventions as a dispassionate political professional would. Relative to many of this year\u2019s speeches, though, Mr. Buchanan\u2019s looks mild. And the full Houston convention was more successful than many people recall. Mr. Bush rose 6 points in the polls afterward, according to the political scientists Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. It\u2019s hard to put on a convention that doesn\u2019t create a polling bounce. A second entry on the list is more recent: the Republicans, in Tampa, four years ago. A hurricane cut it short by a day. Clint Eastwood had a bizarre conversation with an empty chair. And Mitt Romney received no noticeable bump in the polls. But I think the two worst conventions to date were both Democratic ones \u2013 in the topsy-turvy years of 1968 and 1972. The Democrats, like the rest of the country, were riven by the Vietnam War in 1968, and a sense of conflict and violence dominated the Chicago gathering. Security guards shoved Dan Rather of CBS while he was on the air, and outside the convention hall a clash between protesters and the police turned into a riot. The Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, dropped slightly in the polls after the convention. Oh, and this may sound familiar: Some top Democrats were not at the convention, because of intraparty fights. Mr. McGovern fell a remarkable 10 points in the polls after it ended and ultimately lost in a landslide to Richard Nixon. His caveat \u2013 so far \u2013 is the reason we can\u2019t yet make a final judgment. Donald Trump still has to deliver the convention\u2019s most important speech, and the polls still have to offer the public judgment\u2019s. Perhaps Mr. Trump will somehow find a way to appeal to disaffected voters who are perfectly happy to watch him anger the Republican establishment. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a $2 Roadside Drug Test Sends Innocent People to Jail", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "FeatureWidespread evidence shows that these tests routinely produce false positives. Why are police departments and prosecutors across the country still using them?Supported byAlbritton, 43, had dressed up for the trip \u2014 black blouse, turquoise necklace, small silver hoop earrings glinting through her shoulder-length blond hair. Wilson, 28, was more casually dressed, in a white T-shirt and jeans, and wore a strained expression that worried Albritton. One officer asked him for his license and registration. Wilson said he didn\u2019t have a license. The car\u2019s registration showed that it belonged to Albritton.The officer asked Wilson to step out of the car. Wilson complied. The officer leaned in over the driver\u2019s seat, looked around, then called to his partner; in the report Officer Duc Nguyen later filed, he wrote that he saw a needle in the car\u2019s ceiling lining. Albritton didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. Before she could protest, Officer David Helms had come around to her window and was asking for consent to search the car. If Albritton refused, Helms said, he would call for a drug-sniffing dog. Albritton agreed to the full search and waited nervously outside the car.Helms spotted a white crumb on the floor. In the report, Nguyen wrote that the officers believed the crumb was crack cocaine. They handcuffed Wilson and Albritton and stood them in front of the patrol car, its lights still flashing. They were on display for rush-hour traffic, criminal suspects sweating through their clothes in the 93-degree heat.As Nguyen and Helms continued the search, tensions grew. Albritton, shouting over the sound of traffic, tried to explain that they had the wrong idea \u2014 at least about her. She had been dating Wilson for only a month; she implored him to admit that if there were drugs, they were his alone. Wilson just shook his head, Albritton now recalls. Fear surging, she shouted that there weren\u2019t any drugs in her car even as she insisted that she didn\u2019t know that Wilson had brought drugs. The search turned up only one other item of interest \u2014 a box of BC Powder, an over-the-counter pain reliever. Albritton never saw the needle. The crumb from the floor was all that mattered now.At the police academy four years earlier, Helms was taught that to make a drug arrest on the street, an officer needed to conduct an elementary chemical test, right then and there. It\u2019s what cops routinely do across the country every day while making thousands upon thousands of drug arrests. Helms popped the trunk of his patrol car, pulled out a small plastic pouch that contained a vial of pink liquid and returned to Albritton. He opened the lid on the vial and dropped a tiny piece of the crumb into the liquid. If the liquid remained pink, that would rule out the presence of cocaine. If it turned blue, then Albritton, as the owner of the car, could become a felony defendant.Helms waved the vial in front of her face and said, \u201cYou\u2019re busted.\u201dAlbritton was booked into the Harris County jail at 3:37 a.m., nine hours after she was arrested. Wilson had been detained for driving without a license but would soon be released. Albritton was charged with felony drug possession and faced a much longer ordeal. Already, she was terrified as she thought about her family. Albritton was raised in a speck of a town called Marion at the northern edge of Louisiana. Her father still drove lumber trucks there; her mother had worked as a pharmacy technician until she died of colon cancer. Albritton was 15 then. She went through two unexpected pregnancies, the first at age 16, and two ill-fated marriages. But she had also pieced together a steady livelihood managing apartment complexes, and when her younger son was born disabled, she worked relentlessly to care for him. Now their future was almost certainly shattered.The officers allowed her to make a collect call on the coinless cellblock pay phone. She had a strained relationship with her father and with her son\u2019s father as well; instead she dialed Doug Franklin, an old friend who once dated her sister. No one answered. Near dawn the next morning, guards walked Albritton through a tunnel to the Harris County criminal-justice tower\u2019s basement, where they deposited her in a closet-size holding room with another woman, who told Albritton that she had murdered someone. Albritton prayed someone would explain what would happen next, tell her son she was alive and help her sort out the mess. She had barely slept and still hadn\u2019t eaten anything. She heard her name called and stepped forward to the reinforced window. A tall man with thinning hair and wire-rim glasses approached and introduced himself as Dan Richardson, her court-appointed defense attorney.Richardson told Albritton that she was going to be charged with possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine, at an arraignment that morning. Albritton recalls him explaining that this was a felony, and the maximum penalty was two years in state prison. She doesn\u2019t remember him asking her what actually happened, or if she believed she was innocent. Instead, she recalls, he said that the prosecutor had already offered a deal for much less than two years. If she pleaded guilty, she would receive a 45-day sentence in the county jail, and most likely serve only half that.Albritton told Richardson that the police were mistaken; she was innocent. But Richardson, she says, was unswayed. The police had found crack in her car. The test proved it. She could spend a few weeks in jail or two years in prison. In despair, Albritton agreed to the deal.Albritton was escorted to a dark wood-paneled courtroom. A guilty plea requires the defendant to make a series of statements that serve as a confession and to waive multiple constitutional rights. The judge, Vanessa Velasquez, walked her through the recitation, Albritton recalls, but never asked why she couldn\u2019t stop crying long enough to speak in sentences. She had managed to say the one word that mattered: \u201cguilty.\u201dBut this has proved to be a meaningless prohibition. Most drug cases in the United States are decided well before they reach trial, by the far more informal process of plea bargaining. In 2011, RTI International, a nonprofit research group based in North Carolina, found that prosecutors in nine of 10 jurisdictions it surveyed nationwide accepted guilty pleas based solely on the results of field tests, and in our own reporting, we confirmed that prosecutors or judges accept plea deals on that same basis in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Newark, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Diego, Seattle and Tampa.The Houston jail where the officers transported Amy Albritton after her arrest.Even trained lab scientists struggle with confirmation bias \u2014 the tendency to take any new evidence as confirmation of expectations \u2014 and police officers can see the tests as affirming their decisions to stop and search a person. Labs rarely notify officers when a false positive is found, so they have little experience to prompt skepticism. As far as they know, the system works. By our estimate, though, every year at least 100,000 people nationwide plead guilty to drug-possession charges that rely on field-test results as evidence. At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions.After Amy Albritton was arrested, Officers David Helms and Duc Nguyen submitted an incident report and a subsequent laboratory evidence form to the Houston Police Department.\u201cHOLD + ANALYZE FOR COURT,\u201d Helms wrote by hand. And then, with no court case pending, the evidence sat on hold, one of several thousand samples in the laboratory\u2019s backlog of untested pills, plants, powders and assorted crumbs and pebbles.Albritton served 21 days of her 45-day sentence. When she was released, she took a taxi to the motel where she had planned to stay with Wilson, whom she never saw again after the arrest. (Helms and Nguyen would not comment for this article; Wilson did not respond to requests.) The manager had kept her clothes, so she took a room again and waited for her friend Doug Franklin to fly in from Louisiana. The plan was that he would lend her the money to get her impounded car and keep her company on the drive home. When they retrieved the car, it had been sitting in the summer heat for more than three weeks. Albritton was overwhelmed by the smell of rotting hamburgers.When Albritton pleaded guilty, she asked Franklin to explain the situation to her bosses at the rental-property firm, but Franklin decided it was safer to say nothing. She was going to be fired in any case, he reasoned, and alerting an employer about the drug felony would only hurt her future prospects. Albritton had managed the Frances Place Apartments, a well-maintained brick complex, for two years, and a free apartment was part of her compensation. But as far as the company knew, Albritton had abandoned her job and her home. She was fired, and her furniture and other belongings were put out on the side of the road. \u201cSo I lost all that,\u201d she says.Albritton\u2019s older son, Adam, then 24, had been living on his own for years and learned of his mother\u2019s arrest only after she had begun her sentence. While Albritton was incarcerated, her younger son, Landon, remained with his father, who had threatened in the past to seek custody but never followed through. Albritton\u2019s father, Tommy Franklin (no relation to Doug), was openly skeptical about her claim of innocence. \u201cIf the law said you had crack, you had crack,\u201d she recalls him telling her.Albritton gave up trying to convince people otherwise. She focused instead on Landon. Using a wheelchair, he needed regular sessions of physical and occupational therapy, and Albritton\u2019s career managing the rental complex had been an ideal fit, providing a free home that kept her close to her son while she was at work, and allowing her the flexibility to ferry him to his appointments. But now, because of her new felony criminal record, which showed up immediately in background checks, she couldn\u2019t even land an interview at another apartment complex. With a felony conviction, she couldn\u2019t be approved as a renter either. Doug Franklin allowed Albritton and Landon to move in with him temporarily, and Albritton took a minimum-wage job at a convenience store.Through all of this, the crumb of evidence remained in storage in the Houston crime lab. It was a closed case, and the prosecutor, as was standard practice, had filed a motion to destroy the evidence. Only some final paperwork \u2014 a request from the lab and a judge\u2019s signature \u2014 was needed. But this was an extremely low priority in a complex bureaucracy.When Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August 2005, more than 250,000 mostly black refugees streamed into Houston, and local authorities openly anticipated a crime surge in which the refugees were portrayed as would-be perpetrators. Charles McClelland, who retired in February as Houston\u2019s police chief and was then an assistant chief, says the department decided that pursuing drug-possession charges would also help suppress the number of predicted robberies and burglaries. \u201cAnecdotally, it makes sense: Where does a person who has a substance-abuse problem get the money to buy drugs?\u201d McClelland argues. \u201cOne could easily make the connection that they\u2019re committing crimes.\u201d The city distributed thousands more of the color field tests than usual to patrol officers, and drug evidence swamped the controlled-substances section of the lab. Even as the Katrina refugees gradually left Houston, the emphasis on low-level drug enforcement remained. By 2007, annual submissions to the lab had climbed to 22,000, even as budget cuts had reduced the staff, leaving the scientists with far more samples than they could competently analyze.James Miller, the lab\u2019s controlled-substances manager, had long practiced a kind of evidentiary triage. Evidence tied to pending drug manufacturing, sale or possession cases \u2014 50 a year on average \u2014 would receive immediate attention, because only laboratory analysis would be admissible in court. But evidence from cases in which the defendants pleaded guilty before going to trial \u2014 the overwhelming majority of the remaining thousands of submitted drugs samples \u2014 would also be tested. The city had no legal requirement to confirm that the substances were the illegal drugs the police claimed they were. But in Miller\u2019s lab, everything would be checked, even if it took years. \u201cAll along, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re about the science,\u201d he says \u2014 not securing convictions. So the evidence sat, waiting.The forensic scientists in Miller\u2019s lab keep untested samples in Manila envelopes locked in cabinets below their work benches. Some sat there for as long as four years, lab records show. Albritton\u2019s evidence stayed locked up for six months. On Feb. 23, 2011 \u2014 five months after Albritton completed her sentence and returned home as a felon \u2014 one of Houston\u2019s forensic scientists, Ahtavea Barker, pulled the envelope up to her bench. It contained the crumb, the powder and the still-unexplained syringe. First she weighed everything. The syringe had too little residue on it even to test. It was just a syringe. The remainder of the \u201cwhite chunk substance\u201d that Officer Helms had tested positive with his field kit as crack cocaine totaled 0.0134 grams, Barker wrote on the examination sheet, about the same as a tiny pinch of salt.Barker turned to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, or GC-MS, the gold standard in chemical identification, to figure out what was in Albritton\u2019s car that evening. She began with the powder. First the gas chromatograph vaporized a speck of the powder inside a tube. Then the gas was heated, causing its core chemical compounds to separate. When the individual compounds reached the end of the tube, the mass spectrometer blasted them with electrons, causing them to fragment. The resulting display, called a fragmentation pattern, is essentially a chemical fingerprint. The powder was a combination of aspirin and caffeine \u2014 the ingredients in BC Powder, the over-the-counter painkiller, as Albritton had insisted.Then Barker ran the same tests on the supposed crack cocaine. The crumb\u2019s fragmentation pattern did not match that of cocaine, or any other compound in the lab\u2019s extensive database. It was not a drug. It did not contain anything mixed with drugs. It was a crumb \u2014 food debris, perhaps. Barker wrote \u201cN.A.M.\u201d on the spectrum printout, \u201cno acceptable match,\u201d and then added another set of letters: \u201cN.C.S.\u201d No controlled substance identified. Albritton was innocent.In early 2014, Chandler took a call while sitting at her desk, encircled by stacks of case files and pictures of her toddler twins. Eric Dexheimer, a reporter at The Austin American-Statesman, told her he had noticed a series of unusual exonerations coming out of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He\u2019d tracked 21 drug convictions across Texas that had been reversed because labs had found that the drugs in question weren\u2019t really drugs. The laboratory results came after defendants had already pleaded guilty. Did Harris County have any other bad drug convictions beyond what the courts had overturned? Chandler didn\u2019t know, but she said she would try to find out.Chandler called Miller, the controlled-substances manager at the lab, and asked him if there was something wrong with any of their drug convictions. Miller was not surprised to hear from Chandler. He explained that the lab had indeed found problems with their drug convictions; when his forensic scientists found discrepancies in the evidence \u2014 officially labeled \u201cvariants\u201d \u2014 they sent the details by email to the district attorney\u2019s office, and they had been doing so for years. Chandler hadn\u2019t known any of this. She found the email inbox for lab notices, and it did indeed contain hundreds of messages that were sent from the lab. One after another, the lab notices said, \u201cNo Controlled Substance.\u201d In cases involving drug possession, that meant the defendants were not guilty. (Drug manufacturing and selling charges can hold even if the underlying substance is not illegal.)Amy Albritton received this letter informing her that she was prosecuted for a criminal drug offense in error years after she had spent weeks in jail and lost her job and her home.It was unclear if anyone had ever followed up on the notices. When Chandler entered several of the court case numbers into the district attorney\u2019s records-search system, however, she found that a majority of the convictions remained in place. She started a list. Over the course of the following year, she found that the district attorney\u2019s office had failed to correct 416 \u201cvariants\u201d between January 2004 and June 2015, all of them in cases that ended in guilty pleas. Some variants were legally ambiguous \u2014 the field test was positive, but for the wrong drug; the drug weights were incorrect; or there was too little of the evidence to analyze \u2014 but in 251 cases, the results were simple: \u201cNo Controlled Substance.\u201dAnderson, a former district-court judge, had been the top prosecutor for only seven months. Her husband, Mike Anderson, who took office as district attorney in January 2013, died of cancer eight months into his term, and Gov. Rick Perry appointed her to replace him. Now, as Chandler described the problem, Anderson felt sickened. The litany of wrongful convictions was not just enormous \u2014 it was still growing. Her office, she says, was to blame for \u201ca breakdown at every point in the system.\u201d She hired a former prosecutor to research the cases and find the defendants. \u201cIt may sound corny, but it\u2019s true: Our duty under Texas law is to seek justice,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s convictions, but it\u2019s justice.\u201dBased in part on the information gathered by Marie Munier, the former prosecutor Anderson hired to examine the drug convictions, we determined that 301 of the 416 variants began as arrests by the Houston Police Department, with the rest coming from surrounding municipalities, and that 212 of those 301 arrests were based on evidence that lab analysis determined was not a controlled substance, or N.C.S.In our own examination of those 212 cases \u2014 thousands of pages of arrest reports, court filings and laboratory-testing records, along with interviews of prosecutors, police executives, officers, defense attorneys and innocent defendants who pleaded guilty \u2014 we saw a clear story about both who is being arrested and what is happening to them. The racial disparity is stark. Blacks made up 59 percent of those wrongfully convicted in a city where they are 24 percent of the population, reflecting a similar racial disparity in drug enforcement nationally. Patrol units, not trained narcotics detectives, appeared to be the most prolific field-test users.The kits, or the officers interpreting them, got it wrong most often when dealing with small amounts of suspected drugs. Sixty-three percent of the N.C.S. cases involved less than a gram of evidence. The smallest possession cases are the ones in which a field test can be of greatest consequence; if officers find larger quantities of white powder in dozens of baggies or packaged in bricks, they have sufficient probable cause to make an arrest regardless of what a color test shows. (Though in those cases, too, they are generally required to test the drugs.) It\u2019s widely assumed in legal circles that these wrongfully convicted people are in fact drug users who intended to possess drugs. Barry Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit group that seeks to overturn wrongful convictions, says some who work toward exoneration have complained to him that those exonerated of drug charges often are just accidentally not guilty, and shouldn\u2019t be added to the National Registry of Exonerations. The assumption is not entirely without basis \u2014 162 of the 212 N.C.S. defendants had criminal histories involving illegal drugs. However, 50 had no criminal history involving drugs at all.All of the 212 N.C.S. defendants struck plea bargains, and nearly all of them, 93 percent, received a jail or prison sentence. Defendants with no previous convictions have a legal right in Texas to probation on drug-possession charges, even if they\u2019re convicted at trial. But remarkably, 78 percent of defendants entitled to probation agreed to deals that included incarceration. Perhaps most striking: A majority of those defendants, 58 percent, pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, during their arraignment; the median time between arrest and plea was four days. In contrast, the median for defendants in which the field test indicated the wrong drug or that the weight was inaccurate \u2014 that is, the defendants who actually did possess drugs \u2014 was 22 days. Not only do the innocent tend to plead guilty in these cases, but they often do so more quickly.She had struggled to rebuild her life as a felon. The hours at the convenience store were erratic, so she started waiting tables and tending bar as she tried to find work in property management again. In 2013, she heard about a small set of rentals in Baton Rouge that needed someone to run them day to day. The pay was low compared with what she had made at Frances Place, and there was no free apartment. But the owner agreed to interview Albritton, even with her drug felony, and quickly hired her. She had almost nothing to pack besides her clothes and Landon\u2019s before relocating to the state capital. The reason this property owner was willing to hire a drug felon became apparent soon enough. The apartments were in disrepair, with broken heaters and plumbing, and the owner forced his property manager to deal with angry tenants. She had gone to work for a slumlord.Albritton quit and took a bartending position at the restaurant attached to a Holiday Inn near Louisiana State University. Tips included, she was earning about $15,000 a year, but she liked her co-workers and impressed her bosses. One of them tried to promote her to shift supervisor, Albritton recalls, but the promotion was denied when a criminal-background check by the hotel chain\u2019s corporate office flagged the Houston conviction. She could pour drinks and do nothing more. She remembers how desperate she had been to leave her jail cell, na\u00efvely believing that the punishment for pleading guilty would end with her sentence. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not ever free and clear of it. It follows you everywhere you go.\u201dIn the two years since the efforts to overturn wrongful convictions began at the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office, Inger Chandler and her colleagues at the integrity unit have struck 119 N.C.S. convictions from the record. At least 172 remain. They haven\u2019t been able to locate all of the wrongly convicted, at times even after hiring private investigators, and some defendants they have reached have declined to interact with the courts, even to clear their record. Last year, as we examined records in Harris County, we came upon Albritton\u2019s file and decided to search for her ourselves to find out what had happened to one representative figure out of hundreds. Her case fit the larger pattern of convictions for no controlled substance: It moved rapidly, with Albritton pleading guilty within 48 hours of her arrest, and it involved an exceedingly small amount of supposed drugs. We searched for Albritton in public databases, finding likely relatives but no phone numbers or a current address. We called her sister, who said that Albritton was in Baton Rouge and provided a cellphone number. It was disconnected. But knowing where Albritton lived now, we found a Facebook profile she had been updating regularly with details of her life, including her work. Interestingly, we also found that Albritton had pleaded guilty to a 2008 misdemeanor, a D.U.I. conviction in Louisiana, despite breathalyzer results showing her blood-alcohol level at 0.0. When we asked her about this, she said that she had caused a collision by pulling onto the wrong side of a two-lane highway, and because she was guilty of that, she did not protest the other charges; she\u2019s still unable to explain why she confessed to a crime there was no evidence she committed.In August, we called and left a brief message for Albritton at the Sporting News Grill. She returned the call a couple of hours later, her voice small, wondering what this was about. When we described the details from the lab report and the letter from the district attorney that she never received, Albritton gasped. She didn\u2019t make a sound for several seconds before shouting into the phone: \u201cI knew it! I told them!\u201dCrime labs have been moving away from drug cases to focus on DNA and evidence from violent crimes. In some instances, the shift has been extreme. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s forensic laboratory analyzes the evidence in, on average, 1,757 drug cases a year. Many of its 8,000 annual possession arrests depend on field-test results.The United States Department of Justice was once among the leading voices of caution regarding field tests, and encouraged all drug evidence go to lab chemists. But in 2008, the Justice Department funded a program developed by the National Forensic Science Technology Center, a nonprofit that provides crime-lab training, to reduce drug-evidence backlogs. Titled Field Investigation Drug Officer, the program consisted of a series of seminars that taught local police officers how to administer color field tests on a large scale. In its curriculum, the technology center states that field tests help authorities by \u201cremoving the need for extensive laboratory analysis,\u201d because \u201cthe field test may factor into obtaining an immediate plea agreement.\u201d The Justice Department declined repeated interview requests.Field tests provide quick answers. But if those answers and confessions cannot be trusted, Charles McClelland, the former Houston police chief, says, officers should not be using them. During an interview in March, McClelland said that if he had known of the false positives Houston\u2019s officers were generating, he would have ordered a halt to all field testing departmentwide. Police officers are not chemists, McClelland said. \u201cOfficers shouldn\u2019t collect and test their own evidence, period. I don\u2019t care whether that\u2019s cocaine, blood, hair.\u201dJudges, too, have the power, and a responsibility, some argue, to slow down the gears of the system. Patricia Lykos, the Harris County district attorney from 2009 to 2013, says that when she served as a criminal-court judge in the 1980s and 1990s, she would ask the defendants questions about their lives and the crimes they were accused of committing. If she wasn\u2019t satisfied that the defendant was guilty of the charge, Lykos says, she wouldn\u2019t accept the plea. At times the situation is even easier to decipher, says David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. The defendant can be heard arguing his or her innocence to the appointed attorney. In such drug-possession cases, when the prosecutor doesn\u2019t have a lab report, \u201cif I\u2019m that judicial officer, this case is continued\u201d \u2014 adjourned \u2014 \u201cuntil everybody can do their job,\u201d LaBahn says.But that means the defendant, depending on his or her custody status, could go back to jail until the case proceeds, presenting a significant dilemma. Last year, Devon Anderson, the current Harris County district attorney, prohibited plea deals in drug-possession cases before the lab has issued a report. The labs issue reports in about two weeks, but defendants typically wait three weeks before they can see a judge \u2014 enough time to lose a job, lose an apartment, lose everything. And yet since Anderson implemented the rule, case dismissals have soared 31 percent, primarily because the lab has proved defendants not guilty.People plead guilty when they\u2019re innocent because they see no alternative. People who have just been arrested usually don\u2019t know their options, or even that they have an option. \u201cThere\u2019s a fail-safe in there, and it\u2019s called the defense lawyer,\u201d says Rick Werstein, the attorney now representing Albritton as she seeks to finalize her exoneration. Defense lawyers can demand a lab analysis, and they exist to help defendants navigate the consequences of the jail time while they wait, even as they explain the even higher costs of a felony conviction. They are fully authorized to pursue alternative deals.In fact, Richardson, Albritton's original court-appointed lawyer, says the prosecutor offered her a deferred adjudication, in which she may have been able to wait for the results of a lab test outside the walls of a jail cell. Richardson, who first said he had no memory of their conversations, says he told her about the offer but she refused it. Albritton says she has never heard of anything called deferred adjudication. Neither could explain what actually happened. Perhaps they simply accepted that the field test, with its promise of scientific inevitability, would eventually convict her. \u201cThe entire country works on these field-test kits, right?\u201d Richardson asks.In the past three years, people arrested based on false-positive field tests have filed civil lawsuits in Sullivan County, Tenn.; Lehigh County, Pa.; Atlanta, Ga.; and San Diego, Calif. Three of the four cases also named the manufacturers Safari\u00adland Group or Sirchie as defendants. Three of the cases have already been settled. In one of them, the Sullivan County case, Safariland secured a gag order on the plaintiff, explicitly to prevent media coverage, before entering settlement negotiations. The plaintiffs in each of the suits were people who were arrested, refused to plead guilty and were detained for a month or longer. So far, we have been unable find anyone who pleaded guilty based on field-test results and later filed suit, though Werstein said he and Albritton are considering their additional legal options.The Texas Criminal Court of Appeals overturned Albritton\u2019s conviction in late June, but before her record can be cleared, that reversal must be finalized by the trial court in Houston. Felony records are digitally disseminated far and wide, and can haunt the wrongly convicted for years after they are exonerated. Until the court makes its final move, Amy Albritton \u2014 for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of housing, for the purposes of her own peace of mind \u2014 remains a felon, one among unknown tens of thousands of Americans whose lives have been torn apart by a very flawed test.An article on July 10 about roadside drug tests described incorrectly one aspect of the procedure involving a closed drug-possession case. As was standard practice, the prosecutor \u2014 not the Houston Police Department \u2014 filed a motion to destroy the evidence.An article on July 10 about roadside drug tests erroneously included an analysis of cocaine field-test results used by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The sampling did not represent a broad submission of results to the department\u2019s lab \u2014 it was an isolated group of field-test failures including officer mistakes and false positives \u2014 and the data should not have been used to calculate an error rate. The article also misstated the average number of drug cases analyzed by the police department. It was an average of 1,757 cases per year, not 73. And the article overstated the role field tests play in Las Vegas\u2019s possession arrests. According to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, forms of evidence other than field tests can lead to drug-possession arrests. They are not based exclusively on field-test results.Advertisement"}

Venture capitalists have a special term for investment opportunities that offer the potential for a big return but also carry a great deal of risk: high beta. For Silicon Valley\u2019s political aspirations, Mr. Thiel\u2019s speech is the ultimate high-beta performance.On the one hand, an emissary from tech will have a national platform to push the industry\u2019s agenda and, more important, its worldview. By the end of Mr. Thiel\u2019s speech on Thursday night, it\u2019s possible he will have succeeded in showing off an ideology that is rarely encountered in public \u2014 the hands-off-my-stuff, techno-libertarian vision that is a hobbyhorse of Mr. Thiel and a few other Silicon Valley bigwigs.On the other hand, this could end quite badly.Here\u2019s how we analyzed the third night of the Republican National Convention, which featured Mike Pence, Ted Cruz and more.The danger, then, is that not only could Mr. Thiel\u2019s public embrace of Mr. Trump backfire on him, but it could also become another plot point in the larger story line that Silicon Valley is exclusionary and narrow-minded and that its innovations are advancing global inequality.What\u2019s more, the speech could spoil what had been growing areas of overlap between the Republicans and the tech industry. In the Obama years, much of Silicon Valley has become very close to Democrats. This year there was an opportunity for a Republican to make overtures to tech \u2014 but with Mr. Trump, that chance seems to have passed.\u201cWhere Trump has stood on immigration reform, or how he called for a boycott of Apple, or on a number of other issues, it almost seems like he\u2019s gone out of his way to smite Silicon Valley leaders on the issues they care about,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Silicon Valley Republican who has worked for several presidential campaigns, including Mitt Romney\u2019s and John McCain\u2019s. Mr. Harrison said he would vote this year for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential candidate.Mr. Harrison was one of the few Silicon Valley Republicans willing to chat openly about their options this year. Virtually every prominent Republican in the industry whom I called declined to comment or was willing to speak only anonymously about the strained connection between the tech industry and the Republican Party.Mr. Thiel, a billionaire known for his unusual positions, does not appear to be too bothered by kryptonite. And some on the right said they were open to hearing what Mr. Thiel had to say in defense of Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is our democratic process, and I don\u2019t think we should try to shout down Peter Thiel because he\u2019s not saying the same thing that everyone else here is saying,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Initiative, a tech-policy research group.

{"Headline": "House Republicans Back Away From Gun Vote After Conservatives Rebel", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders on Wednesday backed away from plans to vote on a gun measure that already faced broad Democratic opposition after their own conservative members said they would also reject it.Speaker Paul D. Ryan had promoted legislation that would allow the government to block the sale or transfer of a gun if officials demonstrated to a judge within a few days that the buyer might have links to terrorism. But on Wednesday, Mr. Ryan stepped back from an itinerary that had included voting on that measure by the end of the week, saying that the bill still had a path to passage but that the House would vote on it \u201cwhen we\u2019re ready.\u201d\u201cWe have members from both sides of the aisle who want to make improvements, who want to make changes to the bill,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe want to make sure we get it right.\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s comments came after some Republicans \u2014 many of them anti-establishment conservatives who are part of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 began to voice vehement opposition to the bill, saying it would empower the government to infringe on constitutional rights without due process.Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said the legislation would be \u201camong the most egregious gun control measures ever to pass either house of Congress.\u201dThe House Rules Committee, which sets the parameters for consideration of legislation, postponed its plans to examine the bill on Tuesday night, saying it wanted to give members more time to examine and discuss the bill. The committee will need to review the bill and decide whether to allow amendments to be added, for instance, before the House votes on it.The House overwhelmingly approved legislation on Wednesday to expand and improve mental health care, a bill Republicans said would help address gun violence.The bipartisan gun legislation had emerged as lawmakers headed home for the Fourth of July break, a sort of \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d reply to Democrats\u2019 sit-in protest on the House floor. Democrats broadly opposed it, continuing to demand votes on measures that would expand background checks and prevent those on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms.The Senate recently rejected a similar measure, making it clear that even if the bill were to clear the House, it would probably be dead on arrival in the other chamber.Senate Democrats are hoping to resurrect legislation to prevent those on the government\u2019s terrorist watchlist from purchasing guns.But Republican opposition appeared to stymie plans to forge ahead with the measure with just a week and a half to go before Congress breaks for a seven-week recess, as conservatives demonstrated once more their ability and willingness to derail even their own majority-party\u2019s legislation.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, and other Democrats appeared again with advocates outside the Capitol on Wednesday, continuing to prod Republicans.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of Americans want action to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists and criminals \u2014 real action, not a bill written by the gun lobby that they\u2019re going to try to bring up today that will do nothing to keep our community safe,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cBut the Republican House still refuses to disarm hate and allow a vote on common-sense gun violence protection.\u201dDemocrats have worked to keep up the momentum, even holding events during last week\u2019s recess to try to energize wary advocates and prod Republicans. But Republicans have hardly been conciliatory, with House leaders saying Tuesday that they are looking at punishing Democrats for rules they may have violated during their protest, including a prohibition on streaming video from the House floor.A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.Mr. Ryan met late Tuesday with Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John B. Larson of Connecticut, Democrats who organized the recent sit-in. Both sides said it was a pleasant meeting, though Mr. Ryan did not acquiesce to the Democrats\u2019 request for votes on their measures. Mr. Larson said Mr. Ryan did not invite them to offer suggestions to improve the pending legislation.Democrats are working largely behind the scenes to strategize \u201cmoment to moment\u201d about the next steps of their protest, Mr. Larson said. He said that should the rules committee examine the pending bill, the 13-member panel can expect a lot of company at its hearing \u2014 specifically, Democrats demanding votes on their measures.\u201cI think you will see the Rules Committee, that generally doesn\u2019t have an awful lot of participants, you\u2019re going to see a lot of people there wanting to hear about the two bills \u2014 the \u2018no fly, no buy\u2019 and expanded background checks \u2014 and ask for that vote,\u201d Mr. Larson said.In the meantime, Democrats have found themselves standing in unfamiliar company against the current bill. Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said Wednesday that he would not support the pending bill in light of the burdens it could place on ordinary citizens who might erroneously be placed on a terrorist watch list.Moreover, Mr. Gohmert \u2014 who caused a stir during the sit-in weeks ago when he demanded to know why Democrats were not focusing on the role of terrorism in the shootings in Orlando and nearly came to blows with another lawmaker \u2014 said the legislation amounted to rewarding Democrats for seizing the floor.\u201cThere was just a massive violation of rules, and there are supposed to be consequences, and so far the only consequence that we\u2019ve seen is they\u2019re going to get a gun vote, like they were demanding,\u201d Mr. Gohmert said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically giving them what they want.\u201dvideovideoAdvertisement"}

(Convention planners had less time than anticipated to get Quicken Loans Arena ready, thanks to the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 run in the N.B.A. finals.)In a normal election year, a party\u2019s convention would attract a high-profile slate of speakers, including up-and-comers. (A young state senator named Barack Obama made his national debut at the 2004 Democratic convention, for example.) But this is not a normal election year, and a stunning number of Republican leaders have decided not to attend the convention.Apart from the question of star power, there is the question of money. Conventions, like the Olympics, can be a branding boost for the host cities, which is why they lobby so hard to win bids.Despite talk that the polarizing campaign would make it difficult to fund-raise for the convention this year, David Gilbert, the president and chief executive of the nonpartisan Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, said his group has raised more than 90 percent of the $64 million it was given the task of getting, \u201cfar more than any other convention in history.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve always said this was not about red or blue; it was about green,\u201d he said.Even companies that decided to stay in the convention tried to distance themselves from the presumptive Republican nominee, according to Rashad Robinson, a spokesman for Color of Change PAC. He recalled talking to an AT&T representative who stressed the company\u2019s support for immigration reform, in contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\u201cIf any one of their employees came to work and said the things that Donald Trump says in front of the media, on the campaign trail, they\u2019d be fired,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last three standard-bearers for the Republican Party aren\u2019t even going to the convention, so why do these companies feel that they need to?\u201d\u201cTo me, they\u2019re supporting democracy and the democratic process,\u201d said Chip DiPaula, a Baltimore businessman who helped organize the Republican conventions in 1996 and 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s an important celebration of American ideals that are over and above any particular nominee.\u201dMr. Robinson disagreed.\u201cThose companies are on the wrong side of history,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t give credit to people who have empathy. History gives credit to people who stand up and make decisions that are sometimes tough.\u201dMr. Gilbert, the Cleveland convention president, said this year presents \u201ccertainly a more politically charged convention cycle than we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d but added that he felt the city is well prepared.\u201cOne of the problems with this is, it\u2019s just like running any big event,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can prepare. You can plan. But until the event is over, it\u2019s not over.\u201dManaging a convention can make even the most absurd logistical problems seem important. Maria Cino, who has been attending Republican conventions since 1984, and was president and chief executive of the 2008 convention in St. Paul, recalled a particular problem in 1996. The Republicans met in San Diego that year, and the convention center\u2019s ceilings were just 25 feet high, making a traditional balloon drop unfeasible. Instead, engineers shot balloons into the air from cannons. Ms. Cino said it was \u201ca bit of a nightmare.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we would do that again,\u201d she said.Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton, said scenes from this year\u2019s Republican convention could mirror the protests and riots seen outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. That year, the Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, tried to maintain some semblance of order. Mr. Trump, in contrast, isn\u2019t too big on sober discourse.\u201cThere\u2019s an element of Trump that would just thrive if there was chaos going on outside the convention,\u201d Mr. Zelizer said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of his overall rambunctious style of politics. The more controversy, the more confrontation, the more it works to his advantage, the more people cover it.\u201dMr. DiPaula said the foremost concern for any convention planner is pulling off the week smoothly and safely.\u201cThe best feeling was when the convention was over and everybody was safe,\u201d Mr. DiPaula said. \u201cIt was a huge feeling of relief.\u201dDoes he think people\u2019s concerns about the safety at the Republican convention have been overblown? He paused. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s over,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this essay incompletely described Barack Obama\u2019s position when he spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was an Illinois state senator; he was not yet a United States senator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jewish Settlers, Attacked, Needed Help. A Palestinian Doctor Didn\u2019t Hesitate.", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byDAHRIYA, West Bank \u2014 The Palestinian doctor was on his way to Jerusalem to join in Ramadan prayers when he made a decision that many in Israel found inspiring: He helped save the lives of Jewish settlers.Dr. Ali Shroukh, 45, was driving with his brothers along a West Bank road on Friday when they came upon a car that had flipped over onto its roof. The vehicle \u2014 big and boxy, with room to fit many children \u2014 seemed easily identifiable as belonging to a Jewish settler.The car had crashed after a Palestinian gunman fired on it, killing the driver, Rabbi Michael Mark, 46, a father of 10. His wife was critically injured, and one of the two children in the car, a teenage girl, was seriously wounded. The family was on its way to Jerusalem to visit Rabbi Mark\u2019s mother.Dr. Shroukh did not realize that he was witnessing the aftermath of a terrorist attack. His instinct was simply to help.His response was an act of kindness in a conflict that is often bereft of it, particularly amid the violence of the past nine months, when Palestinians have killed more than 30 Israelis. Over 210 Palestinians have also been killed, many while committing an attack or intending to do so.Who is treated, and who is not, has been a particularly contentious issue.A senior Israeli military official said the military constantly checks in with its medics to make sure they understand its policy to treat Palestinian attackers quickly.Since the news of Dr. Shroukh\u2019s selfless actions broke, international and local news media have beaten a path to his tiny urology clinic above a shopping center in Dahriya, a rural border town. His phone continues to ring with Israeli officials who want to thank him.In an interview, Dr. Shroukh said politics were not on his mind on Friday after he was issued a one-day permit to enter Jerusalem. He wanted to pray at the Al Aqsa Mosque compound on the last Friday of Ramadan, a particularly holy day.At a bend in the road, he saw a Palestinian man diverting traffic around the smashed vehicle.The man called out, \u201cBrother, there\u2019s a wounded girl in my car.\u201dThe man and his wife had put the girl in their car while they waited for medics. The couple, who later spoke to an Israeli media outlet and were not identified, said they had been trying to comfort the Marks\u2019 daughter Tehila, who was injured in her abdomen.Dr. Shroukh compressed the girl\u2019s wound with a towel. She was crying and asking questions, but Dr. Shroukh, who does not speak Hebrew, could not understand her.His brother Mahmoud, a day laborer in Israel who speaks some Hebrew, intervened.\u201cShe asked, \u2018What happened to my family?\u2019\u201d Mahmoud Shroukh said. \u201cI said: \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid. My brother is a doctor, and we will take care of you.\u2019\u201d\u201cAre my parents dead?\u201d Mahmoud recalled her asking. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your mother and father are O.K.,\u201d he told her. He did not want to distress her, he said.Then, Dr. Shroukh and his brother checked the vehicle for survivors.They found Rabbi Mark dead. His wife, Chavi, 44, had a serious head injury and was unconscious. Dr. Shroukh and his brother smashed open a window and extracted her.Soon after, an Israeli ambulance came to attend to the victims and take them to a hospital.Then the reality of the conflict sank in: A Palestinian medic who had arrived urged the brothers to leave. This was an attack, not a car accident, he told Dr. Shroukh. Israeli soldiers could arrest him, suspecting him of being an accomplice because he was not dressed as a doctor and was covered in blood. Vengeful Jewish settlers could attack him, thinking he was the gunman.The brothers drove away. Even so, Dr. Shroukh said, he left only after he was sure the victims were being cared for. It was his duty to help, even if he thought he was at risk.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if somebody is a settler, a Jew or an Arab,\u201d he said. \u201cThank God we helped them.\u201dThey reached Al Aqsa Mosque in the evening, breaking their fast and praying.The small moments of compassion did not end there.When some people described Arabs as \u201cmurderous\u201d and \u201cscum of the earth\u201d on the Facebook page of Rabbi Mark\u2019s daughter-in-law, she responded by writing that Palestinians had tried to help, too.The Palestinians \u201cstayed with them in those difficult moments,\u201d wrote the daughter-in-law, Yiska Mark. \u201cI think you should write terrorist, and not Arabs.\u201dIn nearby Otniel, Rabbi Mark\u2019s nephew, Rabbi Menachem Kelmanson, 28, and his wife, Ayelet, 27, sat shiva for their uncle on Monday.Ms. Kelmanson gestured to their street: Three adults, all parents, had been killed in militant attacks since the surge of violence began in October, she said.Still, they maintained good relations with the Palestinians they knew who worked in Otniel, Ms. Kelmanson said, even if they were locked, as a people, into conflict.\u201cWe know Arabs,\u201d Mr. Kelmanson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in revenge.\u201dRabbi Kelmanson asked about the Palestinian doctor who had tried to save his uncle\u2019s family, then began weeping. \u201cTell him thank you, thank you, from all my heart,\u201d he said.Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Night at the Coup", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIstanbul \u2014 AS I walked by the military museum in the Harbiye neighborhood of Istanbul on Friday evening, I was expecting a silent end to a busy week. I was on my way to an adjoining coffee shop where I planned to drink a cup of hot cocoa and read a literary magazine. The museum was eerily silent, but I didn\u2019t think much of it, passing the human-sized mannequins of Ottoman-era janissary soldiers displayed in the windows.It was after 10 p.m. In the coffee shop someone said that, shortly before, soldiers had closed public access to the Bosporus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges, which connect Istanbul\u2019s European and Asian sides. I didn\u2019t think much of that either, linking the news to anxiety about another terrorist attack. The soldiers were probably just there to protect the city\u2019s residents.It was only when I saw, on my phone, videos of fights between police officers and soldiers near the president\u2019s offices that I thought: military coup. I asked the waiter to put my cocoa in a paper cup and headed for Gezi Park, the center of major protests in the summer of 2013. But last night it was breezy and silent, filled with silhouettes of other night-strollers. The park seemed oblivious to politics.My cleaning lady called to ask when things would \u201creturn to normal.\u201d I told her, \u201cSabah ola hayrola,\u201d a Turkish expression that advises waiting until the morning, after things have settled down. Then a friend called to tell me I should stock up on supplies, especially pasta, water and bread. \u201cThe market is still open,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis may be last your chance. Go there now.\u201dThe supermarket nearby was packed with hipsters who alternated between checking their smartphones and checking out one another, tattooed arms leaden with groceries. I ran into a friend who was talking on the phone to a mother full of wisdom acquired during the 1980 coup. It was the same advice: Buy pasta, water and bread.I brought plenty of that back to my apartment. Amira, a curator friend who works in a contemporary art gallery nearby, sought refuge there: Cabs weren\u2019t taking passengers, she said; she couldn\u2019t get back home, in the Anatolian part of the city. We started watching the street through the window. Five minutes later, about 50 youths started running in panic, looking over their shoulders, jumping into open-air cafes. What was going on? I was reminded of the mayhem in Nice, France, the day before.In the living room, we watched as someone on CNN Turk used FaceTime to interview President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and former president Abdullah Gul. They seemed angry, and yet somehow managed to speak calmly. Mr. Erdogan was scheduled to arrive at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, the site of a terrorist attack last month. The pundits on CNN Turk were saying that all would be fine, that things were returning to normal.It was only when Amira and I opened a bottle of white wine to calm ourselves down that the most spectacular events of the evening happened. Military helicopters started bombing Parliament in Ankara while CNN Turk was broadcasting footage of parliamentarians inside. One member of Parliament could be seen pointing her iPhone at the destroyed corners of the building. Then soldiers barged into CNN Turk\u2019s headquarters, made an on-air appearance in the studio and cut off the broadcast.Meanwhile, Cihangir remained deserted, except for the flickering iPad screens I could see from my window in other apartments. The neighborhood was silent, like a classroom of students after the headmaster walks in.According to Facebook, though, people in Tophane, a neighborhood nearby, were marching toward the Bosporus Bridge or taking their cars and heading to the airport. Turkey\u2019s General Directorate of Security had taken to Twitter urging the city\u2019s residents to hit the streets and fill the squares \u2014 an extraordinary request coming from cops.Then it was Mr. Erdogan who sent his own text messages to millions of Turks, calling on them to rally and march. \u201cOur nation hunted coup plotters instead of Pokemons last night,\u201d one journalist tweeted. \u201cThis is how the Turkish nation is.\u201dNot knowing what else to do, I went to bed. It was already time for the morning prayer from the Cihangir mosque. The imam was asking the people to stand with the government. I heard the sound of jets again. Then there was silence, and I fell asleep.When I woke up, around 7 a.m., birds were chirping in the trees. Just half a day after I\u2019d first heard news of the coup attempt, I went for a walk by the Bosporus Strait, magazine in hand, and joined sandal-wearing Istanbul residents who were talking about the events of the night before \u2014 events that killed hundreds of people \u2014 as if they\u2019d only been part of a TV show. In the background was the waterway, a burning sun and two bridges that span two continents, where just hours before tanks had been firing shots.Kaya Genc is a Turkish novelist and essayist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Slain Officer\u2019s Example for Us All", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBaton Rouge, La. \u2014 I was sitting in our church service, which was packed more than usual, when a peek at my Facebook feed revealed the grim news. I elbowed my wife, who was trying to silence our 2-year-old twins. \u201cOfficers shot,\u201d I whispered, discreetly flashing her my phone screen. The look on her face conveyed all of the heartbreak I\u2019m sure everyone else in Baton Rouge, La., felt when they heard the news. We both knew that the fragile steps toward normalcy that our community was beginning to make had instantly unraveled. We were back at square one. Or worse.Once I shared the tragic news with my wife, I couldn\u2019t sit still. I left the sanctuary to make calls, desperate for more information. It was possible to feel the weight of the grief as word spread throughout our church, a majority black congregation. There was a surreal quality to the events unfolding before us. Where were we? How did Baton Rouge become the subject of so much attention and the site of so much public pain?Just the day before, a friend and I crossed paths in the grocery store and spoke of our shared exhaustion. The past two weeks have left us feeling so exposed. While we knew that the investigation into Mr. Sterling\u2019s death would lead to more scrutiny for our community, we discussed the need to reclaim some sense of normalcy. Our conversation reflected what I am sure is a broadly shared sentiment: We were ready to move into the next phase of the healing and rebuilding process.My wife always jokes that I think I know everyone in Baton Rouge. She\u2019s not completely off. Growing up as a fourth-generation resident of the city, I have always felt that way. My grandparents went to high school with my friends\u2019 grandparents. Our parents went to school together as well. Mine is a common story. Baton Rouge has always been an insular community with few natives leaving and few outsiders moving in. That has changed somewhat as the city has grown rapidly in recent decades. Baton Rouge is now the anchor for a metropolitan region with more than 800,000 residents. We\u2019re almost as big as our iconic sister city to the south, New Orleans. But we still have a relatively close-knit feel. That\u2019s why I feel like I know everyone, and that\u2019s why the past two weeks have been so hard.I know members of the Sterling family. Yesterday, I learned that I have friends who were close to our slain police officers. Like so many in this community, I wrestle with the political and human dimensions of this moment. The tragic loss of Officers Jackson, Gerald and Garafola so close to Mr. Sterling\u2019s death and the ensuing protests understandably present an existential dilemma for some. They see the pursuit of justice in one killing as antithetical to maintaining respect for law enforcement. They wrongly blame those calling for justice for Mr. Sterling for the killings of our police officers.In these difficult times, we must reject these false choices. Acknowledging that black life has historically been devalued does not inherently devalue the lives of others. Advocating for more and better community policing can happen in a manner that doesn\u2019t marginalize law enforcement. Bearing witness to the legacy of racial division in our community does not undermine the necessary steps toward progress. It is possible to deplore and mourn the conditions surrounding the death of Mr. Sterling and those of Officers Jackson, Gerald and Garafola. We can oppose unnecessary, excessive force just as zealously as we oppose violence against the police.I\u2019m tired physically and emotionally. Disappointed in some family, friends, and officers for some reckless comments\u2026. I swear to God, I love this city but I wonder if this city loves me. In uniform I get nasty, hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat\u2026. I\u2019m working in these streets so any protesters, officers, friends, family or whoever if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer, I got you.That quotation was shared with me in the initial hours after the shooting. Before the news released the names of the officers, friends of the families were hearing through social media. Upon learning of his death, a friend showed me Officer Jackson\u2019s Facebook page. My friend described him as a \u201ctrue community police officer.\u201d Officer Jackson\u2019s haunting comments caution us against reductionist thinking. He openly wrestled with his identity as a police officer and a black man. He called on his family and his colleagues to not let hate infect their hearts. He understood the complexities of the moment. He set the example for how we all must proceed.In a community as interconnected as Baton Rouge, we simply don\u2019t have the luxury of separating the personal and the political. Our hearts are big enough and our vision is broad enough to process the seemingly oppositional mandates of this moment. The big questions we have to answer will be here for a long time. We must address them. We must make necessary changes. But for now we prepare ourselves for more funerals.Advertisement"}

It is powered invisibly by forces that any city would envy: a green grid that is highly energy-efficient and a superfast one-gigabit internet connection.\u201cPeople would kill for this internet connection,\u201d said Tom Torti, president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cFor us to grow our tech network, we needed to double down on fiber network.\u201d The new Burlington economy is going to be knowledge- and skills-based, he added.This digital superhighway runs through beautiful Burlington, a small city sandwiched between the distant Green Mountains and the 125-mile-long Lake Champlain. It is an outlier as far as emerging technology hubs and so-called smart cities go. But Burlington, which has a lower unemployment rate than Silicon Valley, is now spawning a wave of technology pioneers.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give people an unfair advantage,\u201d said David Bradbury, president and fund manager at VCET. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing too big that you can\u2019t dream here. And the snowball is moving faster.\u201d\u201cSmart cities and new technologies have the potential to change everything,\u201d said Mr. Schirling, a former Burlington police chief. \u201cWhen you put in the right building blocks, you get a collision of ideas, which can become self-generating. It\u2019s attitude and infrastructure. \u201dA result is that Burlington, once a timber port, has a stunningly low unemployment rate of 2.3 percent. On the downside, the city is also experiencing a skilled-labor shortage; hundreds of coding jobs alone languish on job boards. Burlington was named a TechHire city by the White House in 2016 to help link local employers with local workers, and to help these workers get the skills they need for a fast-changing economy. The designation does not come with funding, but it does help Burlington get grants for free training.The TechHire mandate in Burlington is to train 400 technology workers through 2020.\u201cWe want younger people to know that there are career opportunities here,\u201d Mr. Torti said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to grow our work force rather than importing it.\u201dA nonprofit organization known as Vermont Hitec is a crucial part of that vision.It works in partnership with local companies to offer boot camps online and in classrooms that teach skills such as medical coding and programming that lead to good-paying jobs with benefits.Vermont Information Processing, which develops software for the beverage industry, has been working with Vermont Hitec so that it can retrain or recruit employees as its business grows and it becomes less interested in outsourcing.Colleges like the University of Vermont, which offers a biotechnology program, and Champlain College are also helping solve the employment puzzle. Champlain College offers degrees in high-demand careers like digital forensics and game programming, along with a special program for federal employees who can get online degrees in high-growth fields.\u201cWe\u2019re responsive, nimble and entrepreneurial,\u201d said Don Laackman, president of Champlain College. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection between employment needs and sources offered.\u201dBurlington got its first push into technology start-ups when IDX Systems, a health care software maker, was founded there in 1969. It was sold to General Electric about 10 years ago.\u201cIDX created a lot of wealth and talent, and these people could be angel investors,\u201d Mr. Bradbury said. \u201cIt was a tipping point.\u201d\u201cIn the future, there will be several $50 million to $100 million exits here,\u201d Mr. Lane said, \u201calong with other larger ones mixed in.\u201dHe credits Vermont\u2019s community and socially conscious spirit with his success. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy the philosophy that we had to be in a hot spot,\u201d said Mr. Lane, who returned to Vermont after working in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cEven Zuckerberg realized that he could have been anywhere to build Facebook.\u201d\u201cIn Burlington, I can call anyone and learn from their experience,\u201d said Ms. Dibble, who was born in a small Vermont town with no ZIP code. \u201cThe degrees of separation are lessened here. There\u2019s a shared Vermonti-ness.\u201dThe energy to power GameTheory\u2019s innovation comes from Burlington\u2019s green grid, which is owned by the city. The state has long been one of the country\u2019s greenest. But in 2014, Burlington upped the ante by turning only to wind, water and biomass to power the city \u2014 one of the first cities in the nation to do so. There are also incentives for reducing energy. Landlords, for example, can choose to have free energy audits, and more than 100 have done so.Other Burlington businesses also work hard to save energy on their own. Seventh Generation, which makes environmentally conscious household products and was founded in Burlington, gives its employees bonuses for helping reduce greenhouse gases. Like many other companies in Burlington, Seventh Generation also aims to be socially responsible and was formed as a B Corp, which means it has to meet social, environmental, accountability and transparency standards.With this focus on energy efficiency, the city\u2019s electricity rates have not risen in eight years, said Neale Lunderville, general manager of the Burlington Electric Department. \u201cAnd there are no rate increases on the horizon,\u201d he said, \u201csince we\u2019re not chasing the next kilowatt-hour.\u201dElectric cars even have their own parking spaces with chargers.Burlington will eventually become a net-zero city, said the mayor, Miro Weinberger. \u201cOur isolation promotes a commitment to pride and place,\u201d he said.The city that helped propel Senator Bernie Sanders also has its own nonprofit urban farm called the Intervale Center. The land was once an abandoned dumping ground with old tires and cars. That space now contains 350 acres with bee hives, commercial farms, greenhouses and other projects. Through its food hub, local foods are delivered to area businesses and individuals.Intervale\u2019s farm incubator, a five-year program, even teaches new farmers the ropes, said Travis Marcotte, executive director of Intervale Center. \u201cThey then transition out of the Intervale,\u201d he said, \u201cSo we\u2019re spinning off whole farms.\u201dIt is a hopeful message, Mr. Marcotte said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 2", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementPHILADELPHIA \u2014 His life took off, he said, when he fell in love with \u201cthat girl.\u201d He told a familiar love story, recounted in his memoir, about springtime at Yale Law School in 1971 and a \u201cmagnetic\u201d girl with thick blond hair and big glasses and no makeup and a long, white flowery skirt. He said when he first saw her in a political and civil rights class that he wanted to tap her on the shoulder but he knew if he did, he would be starting something beyond his control. With a sky-blue tie and silvery hair and an easy smile, the 69-year-old looked healthier than he has on the trail. And he was sharp. The Big Dog basked in the unique historic moment: a former president and a husband and a wannabe first lad making the case for a former first lady, a wife and a wannabe first woman president. In an act of amazing self-restraint, the man who relishes the word \u201cI\u201d managed to make the talk, as he prefers to call his folksy speeches, all about her. He was positively uxorious. She \u201ccalls you when you\u2019re sick, when your kid\u2019s in trouble or when there\u2019s a death in the family,\u201d Bill said of his partner of 40 years. It has been said that the essence of the Clinton marriage is coming to each other\u2019s rescue in critical moments. Or maybe more precisely, their byzantine conjugal dynamic works like this: One of them creates chaos \u2014 usually Bill \u2014 and then they get out of it together. Or as a former aide described the Clinton pattern: \u201cHubris. Funk. Reintroduction.\u201d \u201cOne of the most seductive characters we\u2019ve seen in American politics in our lifetime,\u201d as David Axelrod calls Bill Clinton, had to melt the sphinx-like aura of his guarded wife. Hill and Bill both have 100-percent name ID but Bill\u2019s task was to reintroduce her as \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever met in my entire life.\u201d A quarter-century after Clinton aides wrote memos about how to warm up and round out Hillary by raising her profile as a mother, Bill was still trying to drive that point home. It is another example of the overcorrecting that marks Hillary\u2019s career. In trying to feminize and maternalize Hillary, Bill almost went overboard about that \u201cgirl,\u201d as he called her three times. He poured on the estrogen, presaging his role as helpmeet in the East Wing. He never mentioned Donald Trump, the man he used to be friendly with and play golf with. He simply alluded to the way the Republican convention had tried to turn Hillary into a \u201ccartoon\u201d villainess. \u201cLife in the real world is complicated and hard,\u201d he said, and \u201ca lot of people think it\u2019s boring.\u201d \u201cOne is real, the other is made up,\u201d he said of the caricature of Hillary. \u201cYou nominated the real one.\u201d He implicitly compared his wife to her gilded rival, limning her as someone genuinely seeking a life of service. He talked about her summer sliming fish in Alaska and all her work for poor children. Hillary has said that she never realized how hard it was to be as great a persuader and performer as Bill until she tried to do it herself. Bill has now given 10 convention speeches and he has had awful moments and great ones. I was there in 1988 when he talked for 33 minutes and the Dukakis delegates began cheering when he finally said \u201cIn closing\u2026\u201d And I was there in 2012, when he won raves for selling Barack Obama\u2019s agenda, after the articulate-but-aloof president somehow wasn\u2019t able to, and had to appoint Bill as \u201cSecretary of Explaining Stuff.\u201d This speech was slightly over 40 minutes. Donald Trump had a soap opera actress speak at his convention but the Clintons easily topped that. Their lives have been an astonishing soap opera in which Bill has played many starring roles \u2013 the loyal spouse, the betraying spouse and the subconscious saboteur. Hillary chafed at eight years of the anachronistic role of first lady, even through slights like getting stationery with the restored middle name of Rodham missing as her husband campaigned for the White House. (She sent it back.) \u201cThat girl\u201d put up with the humiliations of Bill\u2019s hound-dog ways with \u201cthat woman\u201d and others, and let him hide behind her skirt. Bill tried to augment Hillary\u2019s sparse vision, talking about how she would be the right pilot for \u201cthe ride to America\u2019s future.\u201d PHILADELPHIA \u2014 If the media won\u2019t come to you, you go to them.Vermont cast its votes last, and Mr. Sanders smiled tearfully as the room applauded his effort in the Democratic primary. It was Mr. Sanders\u2019s latest show of graciousness in conceding the nomination to Mrs. Clinton. But for his most die-hard supporters in the audience, that was not an acceptable end to his time as a presidential candidate.\u201cWALK OUT! On the DNC and corporate politics,\u201d a neon green flyer distributed to the delegates read. \u201cAll participating delegates to walk out as one group.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s supporters marched to the huge media tents. Most of the protesters were silent, and some wore duct tape over their mouths as a sign of them being \u201csilenced\u201d by the Democratic National Committee. They walked into the media filing tent and were immediately mobbed by reporters.They held up handmade signs: \u201cDNC, you\u2019re fired\u201d; \u201cThis is what a stolen election looks like\u201d; \u201cThe Democratic Party just elected Donald Trump.\u201d Some used the hashtag #DemExit, a reference to Brexit.Kimberly Tucker, a Virginia delegate for Mr. Sanders, said she can\u2019t support Mrs. Clinton \u201cbecause I\u2019m not sure that she actually won.\u201d She said that while other die-hard supporters of Mr. Sanders\u2019s had been talking about leaving the Democratic Party, she intended to stay.\u201cI know a lot of people took their things and they\u2019re leaving, and I stand in solidarity with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also need to have Democrats that stay and force change from within, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201dRashane Hamby, a young Sanders delegate from Kansas, said she hopes Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters will keep working on the movement at a local level \u201cafter the cameras are gone.\u201d\u201cThe thing is with Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t know who she is. Donald Trump shows me who he is each and every day. Hillary Clinton switches her position depending on who she\u2019s talking to,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not with Black Lives Matter, but I know that my son\u2019s life matters, and if Hillary is in office, she needs to know that she will be held accountable. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201dMs. Hamby, who is black, said she is frustrated with both Mrs. Clinton and President Bill Clinton\u2019s response to Black Lives Matter protesters, and said she wished other people in the black community demanded more from them.\u201cWe give our vote away each and every presidential election, hoping that the person that spoke to the most churches will do something for us. Senator Sanders was the only person who handed his microphone over and allowed Black Lives Matter to use his platform,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really changed me.\u201dChris Pumpelly, another young Sanders delegate from Kansas, took a more pragmatic approach.\u201cBernie Sanders didn\u2019t win the nomination, and he just told us that we need to be supporting the Democratic Party and the most progressive platform that this party has ever seen. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of my friends disagree with supporting the party up and down the ticket. I understand that. But I see Donald Trump as an existential threat to the world.\u201dSusan Eacker, an Ohio delegate for Mr. Sanders, said she didn\u2019t know about the walkout until just before it took place.\u201cTell Bernie we said sorry we rained on his parade, but he taught us too well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he was younger, he\u2019d be doing the same thing.\u201dPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Oh, remember those simple days when bizarre utterances disqualified a candidate?In his convention speech, Howard Dean, the former presidential candidate and governor of Vermont, just reminded us of those times when he reprised \u201cthe Dean scream,\u201d the call to arms he yelped after the Iowa caucuses in 2004. It effectively halted his presidential run that year and all but ended his electoral career.Then walked off the stage, laughing. Probably to tweet something.If you judge by America\u2019s ugly, raucous, invigorating and inspiring political history, it\u2019s clear that the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, just lost her job for doing it. Politicians are not popes. The leader of the D.N.C. must be a tough pol, more Rahm Emanuel than Barack Obama. Good leaders protect their party\u2019s interest fiercely, as Wasserman Schultz did in opposing a candidate who spent decades boasting of his disdain for her party. Today, with primaries empowering party members, not bosses, D.N.C. chairs are supposed to be neutral, but few pull it off. In 1976, Robert Strauss managed it, staying neutral and focusing on unifying Democrats once the surprise nominee, Jimmy Carter, emerged. The most successful recent D.N.C. chairmen have been passionate partisans like Ronald Brown and Terry McAuliffe, both big Bill Clinton fans. In 2008, Howard Dean, trying to preserve his grass-roots 50-state strategy, was better at balancing between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Let\u2019s stop pretending and welcome the mess. Even the emails speculating about trying to exploit Bernie Sanders\u2019s supposed atheism make sense: Politicians drill down on these perceived weaknesses because many voters care about them. Both parties need leaders who will defend partisan interests vigorously and assess the political environment honestly, as Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, repeatedly. Her successor will make similar moves \u2014 or she will fail her party. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The slow-motion withdrawal of Bernie Sanders and his increasingly obnoxious Bernie-or-Busters was not actually the first clenched-teeth confrontation between a losing leftie and a winning Clinton.It may be too late for Sanders to tame his following now, but that problem is largely of his own making. Sanders took far too long to concede that he lost the nomination race, and his endorsement speech for Clinton was a case study in churlishness. He talked mostly about himself and encouraged his supporters to go on fighting.He did praise Clinton\u2019s position on big issues, but gave the impression that he mostly wanted to take credit for getting her to agree with him. \u201cIt is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,\u201d he said, and added: \u201cBut I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee, there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns.\u201dThe platform? Seriously? The last time any candidate mentions the platform is on the day it is adopted. The job Sanders had to do was to get his followers to realize that if they stay home on Election Day, they will be helping Trump, especially the young ones who tend not to vote in large numbers anyway.He said it, sort of, in the middle of his long speech. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe this election is important, if you think you can sit it out, take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties, equal rights and the future of our country,\u201d he said.Then he skated on to talk about all the people he met during the primary campaign who really loved him.Perhaps Sanders was too worried that his supporters would riot if he did something like that. Or maybe he\u2019s just too cranky.In any case, Sanders waited until the very end of the long roll call \u2014 when even his own state had voted \u2014 to move that the \u201cofficial record\u201d show that Clinton won by acclamation.Exit Bernie Sanders, stage left.\u201cIt was 1969. I lived in Philly. I was going to Haverford High School and my 24-year-old brother, Sydney, was alarmed at my lack of dating. He was the one who introduced me to things that were \u2026 temptations. He went to Wesleyan, same school I went to. He got a master\u2019s in urban planning but he never used it. He became an automobile mechanic in Berkeley in 1973.\u201cMy dad died when I was a kid. I had just turned 8 but he\u2019d been sick for two and a half years. He had intestinal cancer. Anyway, my brother raised me to a large extent. He was seven years older and he knew what was hip. He decided he was going to set up a double date. So he asked which girls I knew, and he stood beside me while I made the phone call and then I had a list of, like, six conversation topics so I wouldn\u2019t run out of things to talk about with this girl I hardly knew, Sherry Lefevre.\u201cAnd he said, `You gotta come see this band, they\u2019re really good.\u2019 So he got the tickets and we went down to the Electric Factory & Flea Market to see a band called Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin. Well, I didn\u2019t know who she was but I immediately went and bought the record.\u201cSo we did double date and the four of us went down together and in those days, South Street was pretty funky. They didn\u2019t have a green room so the musicians, all the instruments were on the stage, but they stepped through the crowd. And we were all sitting cross-legged on the floor of this big concrete warehouse and Janis Joplin steps right over me and she pauses to say something to someone, and she had a paisley skirt on, a full-length paisley skirt, and she was just stopped there. And I wanted to see if it was silk or cotton and I just touched it, and she looked at me and went \u2018Down, boy.\u2019\u201cI was 17, I didn\u2019t know what to do. So then they played an amazing set. It was just when the record \u2018Cheap Thrills\u2019 came out and it had that song `Down on Me.\u2019 That was their closer, it was just a kick-ass.\u201d\u201cOnce a teacher, always a teacher,\u201d said Ms. Warren, a former Harvard Law professor. The slide show featured vintage photos of Ms. Warren mixed in with sleek graphics about the shrinking of the middle class in the last 50 years. \u201cThings were not perfect,\u201d she said, citing the racism, sexism and homophobia of past eras. \u201cBut over time, we were bending in the right direction, and these government investments in education, in infrastructure, in research, let us turn our hard work into real success.\u201d She then launched into a point-by-point indictment of trickle-down economics, offshore tax havens, predatory lending, corporate loopholes and the corrupting influence of money in politics. This was far from a political attack on Donald J. Trump, though she has proven adept at going after the Republican nominee. Instead, she gave the Warren wing of the party a mini-dissertation on the roots of economic inequality, and what she thinks the government should do to fix it. After a night of political theatrics, she seemed eager to get and get back to the wonky discussions she made a name for herself with. As Ms. Warren said that spending on direct lobbying has increased sevenfold since 1983, a slide showed the Capitol getting showered in gold coins. Another graphic demonstrating income inequality showed a scale with a Boston Red Sox baseball cap representing the bottom 90 percent of earners on the lower end, and a top hat representing the top 10 percent at the higher end. Per Professor Warren: In 1980, 90 percent of Americans got 70 percent of all new wealth generated. In 2016, the same share of Americans received less than 1 percent of the new wealth generated. She ended her speech by telling attendees to demand four things of the people they vote for: that they work to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, increase Wall Street regulation, raise taxes on the top 10 percent of earners, and increase funding for welfare programs. But she could barely get the word \u201cloophole\u201d out of her mouth before a man in the audience started clapping in agreement. \u201cAll I can say is, you\u2019re my kind of guy,\u201d she said. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 In presidential election after presidential election, Republicans have presented themselves as the champions of \u201cfamily values,\u201d which is their synonym for a certain kind of traditionalism and religiosity, and they often chose a nominee who wore that label well. That was certainly the case in 2012, with Mitt Romney. It\u2019s not with Donald Trump. He has been married three times. He made much of his money from casinos. His lifestyle connotes showy materialism and hedonism. And he has a history of inflammatory remarks, including sexually blunt ones that objectify women. His perch is not exactly the peak of Walton\u2019s Mountain. And that may allow for some new positioning by Democrats, as Michelle Obama\u2019s speech to the Democratic National Convention made clear. Her message was squarely directed at American parents. It specifically concerned their kids. While it never mentioned Trump by name, it definitely asked what kind of example he\u2019d set, unmistakably advancing the idea that he\u2019d be a threat to any family trying to instill certain values \u2014 decency, empathy, politeness \u2014 in children. Watch and listen for other Democrats and for the Clinton campaign to continue taking this tack. Right near the start of her speech, the first lady described the challenges of getting her own children \u201cto ignore those who question their father\u2019s citizenship,\u201d to hold on to their dignity when \u201csomeone is cruel or acts like a bully,\u201d and to disregard \u201cthe hateful language they hear from public figures on TV.\u201d Is it possible that she had Trump in mind? \u201cWith every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us,\u201d she said of herself and the president. \u201cWe as parents are their most important role models. And let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady, because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country, kids who tell us, \u2018I saw you on TV.\u2019 \u2018I wrote a report on you for school.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s aimed at a group of voters who have favored Republican presidential candidates but, in the eyes of many Democrats, could be pried away from Trump. \u201cThe crassness of some of his commentary has potentially opened up an opportunity for Democrats to be the family-friendly party for a specific cohort of voters in particular: suburban mothers with kids,\u201d said Chris Lehane, a prominent Democratic strategist. He noted that in 2012, Romney won among married women in general and among women in the suburbs in particular. Kathleen Rice, a Democratic congresswoman from the Long Island suburbs of New York City, framed Trump\u2019s liability \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 opportunity \u2014 this way: \u201cYou can\u2019t be the party of family values if the values you\u2019re teaching your kids are hate and bigotry.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s lost on any parents in this country,\u201d she told me. \u201cDemocrats have the opportunity to regain the ground on the long-told political falsehood that Republicans are the party of family values.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t exactly surrendered the mantle of dutiful, loyal family man: Four of his five children spoke at the Republican National Convention, praising him as a terrific father and demonstrating obvious affection and respect for him. And he has drawn fresh attention to Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities, reminding Americans that the Clintons, as a family, have known plenty of mess themselves. Only 25 percent said that about Trump. The Trump children shone last week like beams in a storm: Tiffany (adorable); Donald Trump Jr. (enthusiastic); and Ivanka Trump (as polished and upbeat as a corporate recruiter, if about as credible). Melania Trump added elegance to the proceedings until she disgraced herself. And then there was Michelle Obama, who soothed the agitated, uplifted the fearful and gently pointed out our duty to unite in the face of the enemy, all with the steady warmth expected of a mom in chief. When you compare the United States with constitutional monarchies, you see that the president combines the roles of prime minister and king. (This is a political theory clich\u00e9, not an original observation.) Presidents rule executively, through the formal channels of power, and they rule symbolically, embodying the human qualities we hope to perceive in our bureaucratic state: strength, fatherliness, charisma. The Trumps\u2019 prominence also communicated an important message: that Donald J. Trump runs his business tribally, nepotistically, allocating power according to kinship rather than merit. Also, that he\u2019s not just a man, he\u2019s a corporate entity. Rule by Mr. Trump will be rule by the Trump Organization, whose day-to-day responsibilities fall more on the children than on the chief. I don\u2019t think Ivanka Trump was lying when she attributed family-friendly policies to her father that he has never endorsed himself. I think she believes she can talk him into them because she\u2019s always been his brain trust and he\u2019s never been a detail man. And she\u2019s Daddy\u2019s girl. None of this is unique to Mr. Trump. The Clintons are also a family business, also a reality show, also a fairy tale \u2014 a deconstructed, feminist fairy tale. The queen stands poised to take the reins of power. The once-great king verges on buffoonery. The princess\u2019s role is uncertain, but her young motherhood will surely be put to good political use. At various boo-spattered moments throughout yesterday\u2019s proceedings, both puckish conservatives and fretful liberals began wondering if the Democratic Party could end up having a more chaotic convention than the party of Trump did in Cleveland \u2014 more disrupted, more divided, with more overt hostility to the nominee.But even amid the heckling from Bernie Sanders\u2019s die-hards, what\u2019s striking about the Democratic Party\u2019s problems is how normal they seem compared with what\u2019s happened to the Republicans.Yes, the Sanders insurgency may betoken future divisions that ultimately split the Democratic coalition. But for today, in this election cycle, it has reached a very typical sort of endgame, characteristic of right-wing and left-wing primary challenges alike. His campaign clearly shifted the party and its nominee leftward, albeit not as far as his more zealous partisans had hoped; now he has endorsed the nominee and called for unity, like Bill Bradley in 2000 or Jesse Jackson in 1988 or Pat Buchanan in 1992. The only question is whether a minority of a minority of his supporters might vote for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson or just stay home.Of course the Democrats would rather that minority of a minority were firmly in their tent. But having a loosely attached fringe is a very normal political situation. (See, for instance, the Ron Paulistas in the G.O.P. in 2008 and 2012.) And so is the Democratic National Committee\u2019s collusive response to this fringe\u2019s champion, which our dear friends in Russia may have oh-so-helpfully exposed.There was schadenfreude from the beleaguered folks in the Republican National Committee as they watched Debbie Wasserman Schultz twist in the wind this week. But Schultz went down, in part, for doing the kind of very normal thing that they so egregiously failed to do \u2014 steering the party\u2019s nomination away from the candidate of a passionate plurality and toward the candidate who (for all her many flaws) is closer to the party\u2019s center, its consensus and mainstream.In other words: Schultz lost her job but kept her party; Reince Priebus kept his job but let a hostile takeover happen on his watch.And because the Democrats didn\u2019t endure such a takeover, the major evening speeches (which is all that most nonpolitical junkies see) should be unifying events in a way that nothing at the G.O.P.\u2019s Trump week could match. Instead of Melania Trump\u2019s plagiarism, Michelle Obama\u2019s eloquence. Instead of Ted Cruz\u2019s defiance, Bill Clinton\u2019s honeyed sales pitch. Instead of the party\u2019s past presidents and nominees as no-shows, a president with 50-plus approval ratings blessing his would-be successor.Because Trump\u2019s whole appeal is premised on the idea that our elites think things are under control when they actually are not, and his only path to victory is as a coalition-scrambling, both-parties-upending force. And what this convention is showcasing is a Democratic Party that\u2019s fully prepared to beat him under the normal rules of politics \u2026 but is not necessarily ready to adapt if events go wildly off that script.But there\u2019s yet another reason she was so raptly heard and rapturously received. She didn\u2019t speak as a politician. Just ask Hillary Clinton. As she stepped down from her position as the secretary of state and in the year afterward, a significant majority of Americans liked and respected her, as easy as that is to forget now. According to the Pew Research Center, 65 percent of Americans viewed her favorably in December 2012, 56 percent in October 2013 and 58 percent in August 2014. That was down to 43 percent by last August, which was about four months after she declared her presidential bid. Yes, her rosy period of above-50 ratings came before the revelation of her use of a private email server and her initial, clumsy attempts to shrug the whole thing off. Yes, it was before Republicans intensified their chant of Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi and refocused their fire on her in other ways. Yes, it was before a bruising Democratic primary battle in which Bernie Sanders painted her as a compromised tool of corporate interests. But her popularity during that period had as much to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t in the news every day, being forced to render opinions and stake out positions, and she wasn\u2019t making any self-serving requests of Americans. A campaign may be framed and pitched in terms of public service and patriotism, but it also comes across as precisely such a self-serving request. Clinton\u2019s path from first lady to senator, secretary of state and, now, Democratic presidential nominee guaranteed that there\u2019d be speculation about Michelle Obama\u2019s political future. But Obama\u2019s own actions have done nothing to encourage that guessing. \u201cWhen they set off for their first day at their new school, I will never forget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just 7 and 10 years old, pile into those black S.U.V.s with all those big men with guns,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only thing I could think was, \u2018What have we done?\u2019 \u201d She cited concern for her children when she addressed her future plans in a speech at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., in March. \u201cI will not run for president,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, nope, not going to do it.\u201d She added that while she intended to use her stature to effect change, she ideally wanted to do that in a nonpartisan fashion and \u201cimpact as many people as possible in an unbiased way.\u201d And then, there she was, the actual first lady, not a montage. As she spoke, the auditorium fell silent for the first time that night. \u201cWith every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country, kids who tell us, \u2018I saw you on TV, I wrote a report on you for school.\u2019 \u201d I watch her, with avid eyes, and even as I do, I am afraid of my own avidity, of all of ours. These past eight years has been a time of watching her with my heart in my throat. I read the news and I am afraid of how quickly in this country admiration \u2014 especially for women, especially for women with big brains and hearts, especially for black women who have both \u2014 how quickly admiration can curdle into ridicule. It is a fine, fine line to walk. I watched Hillary Clinton walk a version of it when I was young. I thought a first lady who quotes African proverbs, who says, \u201cIt takes a village,\u201d has to understand me and the struggles of my family, and then I became, as the years went by, disillusioned. Twenty-four years ago, I was so unabashedly excited for Mrs. Clinton to be first lady that my sisters and I stayed up late to watch her at the convention. We made a Hillary Clinton button for our cat. I don\u2019t know that as an adult I will recapture that kind of blind devotion to a public figure, and I would argue, that\u2019s what growing older and asking questions is all about. But Mrs. Obama, somehow, is different. I watched her stand on stage (\u201cI think she\u2019s in body armor,\u201d a friend posted to Facebook) and saw how underneath the glare of the lights she didn\u2019t blink. She said this line, knowing it would be dissected and pilloried by many the next morning. But she said it, calmly, knowing it was the truth. I think that\u2019s why some of us watch her so closely. We want to figure out how to get to where she stands. The start of the Democratic convention offers reason to wonder whether the party is in the early stages of a new phase \u2013 a self-defeating phase in which a large segment of liberals would rather lose than compromise. Let\u2019s be clear: The hecklers in Philadelphia are doing Donald J. Trump\u2019s work. They are his allies, no matter how much they may believe otherwise and no matter how honest their passion. Their attempts to inject chaos into the convention will undermine the single best opportunity that Hillary Clinton has to make her case to voters. Whatever their motives, the Bernie-or-Busters are actually working to keep Citizens United as the law of the land. They are working to cut taxes on the rich. They are working to take health insurance away from families that have only recently received it. They are working for Big Coal and against the climate. They are doing the bidding of a candidate who has demeaned prisoners of war and the disabled, described Mexicans as rapists, referred to women as barnyard animals, called for banning Muslims from entering the country and cozied up to Russia\u2019s authoritarian president. There is still plenty of work for Sanders supporters to do. They can pressure Mrs. Clinton to hold fast to her campaign positions. They can identify and campaign for candidates who believe in a more radical liberalism than the Clintons or the Obamas. And they can do everything within their power to prevent a Trump presidency \u2013 a presidency with the potential to be more damaging to the country than any in our lifetimes. How\u2019d that work out for the liberal cause? PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Having served as Australia\u2019s first female prime minister, I often get asked for advice by bright young women interested in politics.What sustains someone through the rigors of modern politics, I tell them, are passion and purpose: knowing what you want to achieve for your nation and the world. Then I tell them to build a sense of self that can survive all the ugly sniping.This week at the Democratic National Convention, where I participated in a forum on women and leadership, I\u2019ve been asked what advice I\u2019d have for Hillary Clinton as she seeks to become her nation\u2019s first female leader. I\u2019m not egotistical enough to think that the most qualified and prepared presidential candidate the United States has ever seen needs my advice on policy. And she needs no lectures on sustaining a sense of self when under news media scrutiny or attack by her rivals. Few politicians have shown more resilience than Mrs. Clinton.But even someone of her vast experience has been buffeted by what I call the \u201ccurious question of gender.\u201d She knows what it\u2019s like to be the subject of the stereotype that a powerful woman cannot be likable, that if she is commanding then she must be incapable of empathy.Mrs. Clinton should not have to deal with this alone. Every Democrat, every Republican, every person who believes that women and men are equal should call out any sexism.I have often reflected how powerful it would have been if, at that moment, a male business leader, especially one who opposed my policies, said, \u201cI may not support the prime minister politically, but Australia must not conduct its democratic debates this way.\u201dUnfortunately, that never happened.To my dismay, some of the young women who chat with me are not asking for political insights. Instead, they tell me that, having seen how I was treated, they have decided politics is too punishing for them. I always try to talk them out of this position. Sometimes I succeed.In 2016, I hope there are many brave voices naming and shaming any sexism in the presidential contest. The next generation of potential female leaders is watching.Julia Gillard was the prime minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013.\nColumnist David Brooks and editorial board writer Elizabeth Williamson discussed Bernie Sanders, Michelle Obama, and what\u2019s to come.\nAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Grief That White Americans Can\u2019t Share", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byEssayWhen my alarm went off at 6 a.m., I checked my Twitter feed, as I always do, while still snuggled in bed. I read a few Twitter messages, then closed my eyes, the hand holding my phone falling limply to my side. Overnight, while I was sleeping, another video, of another police killing, of another black man, in another American town, had gone viral.I lay in my bed for the next hour, unable to gather the will to get dressed for the day. I turned the news on and listened as I read everything I could.I wrestled with myself over whether to watch this video, too. I am a reporter and this was news. I am a human being, a black woman in a country where black death has long been spectacle.I watched.I stayed stuck in bed another hour, wanting to wake my husband, who was snoring lightly beside me, but deciding against it: Let him have a few more moments of peace before waking to face another day in America where a black man just died for a traffic violation.Finally, I pulled myself out of bed, showered, dressed and then sat down at my vanity mirror. I looked into my own eyes. The despair peering back at me was too much. Before I could stop them, the tears came. I sat there, unable to look at myself again, crying into my hands.I needed to get to work, but the last thing I wanted to do was make small talk about inane things with people for whom this might be a tragedy, but an abstract one. To many white Americans, the killings of black men and women at the hands of the state, are individual incidents, each with a unique set of circumstances. For white people, who have been trained since birth to see themselves as individuals, the collective fear and collective grief that black Americans feel can be hard to grasp.But for black Americans like me, the killings of black men and women at the hands of the state with no justice to be had, is among the oldest and most familiar American stories.How do you explain the visceral and personal pain caused by the killing of a black person you did not even know to people who did not grow up with, as their legacy, the hushed stories of black bodies hung from trees by a lynching mob populated with sheriff\u2019s deputies? Or of law enforcement, who often doubled as the Ku Klux Klan, killing black Southerners on lonely roads under the gaze of a silent moon?To many of us, the almost guaranteed failure in modern times to hold the police responsible for these deaths feels eerily familiar; black Americans add these recent cases to the list of countless black people who died a few generations ago \u201cat the hands of persons unknown.\u201dBut, of course, this is not just about history and our disparate recollections of it. It is about now, and the way the vast gulf between the collective lived experiences of white Americans and that of black Americans can make true empathy seem impossible.How do you explain \u2014 how can you make those who are not black feel \u2014 the consuming sense of dread and despair, when one sees the smiling faces, captured in photos, of Mr. Castile and Mr. Sterling, and knows that but for the grace of God, it could have been your uncle, your brother, your child, you? That if a police officer, his mind having soaked up centuries of racial fears, were to stop your loved one, or you, he may not be able to see a family man or doting mother? Someone who is not a boogeyman, but someone whom, as Ta-Nehisi Coates so piercingly lays out in \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d parents, aunts and uncles, grandparents, spouses, children and community had poured their love, hopes and dreams into. Someone who pushed a daughter on the swing, hugged a fianc\u00e9e after an argument, told bad jokes.How do you explain that awful understanding that each of these deaths confirms for black citizens, that if stopped by the police, we may be stripped down to our most basic of elements, that one part of us that is a complete fiction: our race. And that fiction \u2014 the American crime of blackness \u2014 can turn a broken taillight into a death sentence.The last thing I wanted to do that day, and on many days, was face people who did not, at a gut level, get this. My friends, also struggling to leave their homes and head out into the world, reached out to me, and I to them. We sent texts and Facebook messages. We grieved together, trying to fill the hollow with love. Many people called into work that day, unable to deal with the mundane in the face of a tragedy.We\u2019d been here again and again, but somehow, this felt depressingly the same yet also different. Even older black people, typically stoics from weathering things my generation has not had to, found themselves, to their alarm, crying as well.Later I would interview a man in Texas named Patrick Francis. He grew up in a rough part of Houston, went to college to study criminal justice and spent 10 years in law enforcement before switching to a career in internet technology. This was not a man prone to displays of emotion. Somewhat bewildered, the father of four grown sons, he explained that he\u2019d cried more than once following the two recent killings. And as he recounted trying to talk his son down from the white-hot rage he felt, I could hear emotion constricting Francis\u2019s voice through the phone as he apologized for his tears.Sorrow was debilitating, but anger fueled resolve. I hung up with my friend, washed my face, and headed into work.That same night, a black sniper took the lives of five Dallas police officers during a protest against police violence. And then a little more than a week later, another black man killed three police officers in Baton Rouge. The mourning for these deaths, too, came wrapped in another fear, shared by those who did not want violence against black citizens or violence against the police: that, once again, the actions of a few would be a smudge against us all; that the crimes of two unstable men would derail a protest movement that sought only value for black lives.And I could not help but think that this callous taking of life, the killing begetting killing, had revealed a rupture. I am not sure it will ever be fixed.Advertisement"}

Where were the editor and staff to guide her? Were they doing their actual job of editing book reviews rather than fiction? Are they qualified to edit fiction? Or were they too dazzled by the fact that \u201cAmericanah\u201d was on the Book Review\u2019s list of the 10 Best Books of 2013, a point they took pains to make?Politically, it was beneath the Book Review to give that much publicity to a presidential candidate. John Williams justified this in his Open Book column by saying that Hillary Clinton would soon be the subject of a work of satire because \u201cwe like to play fair.\u201d A few questions: What makes the Book Review think readers will be persuaded of their impartiality, given their partiality toward a particular writer\u2019s work? Do Pamela Paul and her staff really believe that Hillary Clinton deserves to be belittled to the level of a presidential candidate\u2019s wife? Is it simply because she\u2019s a woman? (Note: She was secretary of state and is currently a presidential candidate, in case anyone has forgotten.) I hope the Book Review will have the integrity to admit to the implied insult of this comparison and abandon any more \u201cassignments\u201d of this kind.Finally, note that the \u201cassignment\u201d changed.

But for a newspaper of your reputation and high calling, what purpose is served in running a piece that \u2014 without evidence \u2014 speculates on the sexuality of the candidate\u2019s wife and so ruthlessly exploits \u2014 again without evidence \u2014 the peculiar vulnerabilities of a blended family? Was it worth squandering the reputation of a newspaper revered for its objectivity just to get a few laughs at the expense of three women (Melania, Tiffany and Ivanka Trump) who aren\u2019t even running for office?

{"Headline": "Needing Time to Recover, Roger Federer Will Miss the Rest of the Season", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byRoger Federer announced Tuesday that he would miss the rest of the tennis season, including the Rio Olympics and the United States Open, to rehabilitate a knee injury.Federer, who turns 35 next month, tore the meniscus in his left knee while running a bath for his twin daughters a day after losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open. In February, he had surgery, the first of his 18-year career.Federer, a 17-time Grand Slam singles champion, has not played since losing in the Wimbledon semifinals about three weeks ago. Although he pulled out of this week\u2019s Rogers Cup in Toronto, he was expected to play singles, doubles and mixed doubles for Switzerland at the Olympic tennis tournament, which begins Aug. 6. He will miss the United States Open, where he was a finalist last year.Until this year, Federer had avoided the long-term injuries that have plagued his rival Rafael Nadal, who is sidelined with a wrist injury.Federer\u2019s back, an occasional problem in recent years, was the primary source of questions when he came back for the grass-court season. He reached the semifinals of Wimbledon while playing down his fitness and his expectations.\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t hurt myself,\u201d Federer said after the match. \u201cThen, is it a three-day thing, is it a 24-hour thing or is it more? I don\u2019t know at this point. I hope it\u2019s not so bad. I walked it off. I was able to finish. But I don\u2019t slip a lot. I don\u2019t ever fall down. It was a different fall for me than I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dCarlos Moya, one of Raonic\u2019s coaches, said it was difficult to tell if Federer had reinjured the knee in his fall.\u201cObviously, Roger has been having health issues this year more than he\u2019s had in past years,\u201d Moya said Tuesday in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but this is what starts to happen when the age creeps up. And with the injuries, the level of consistency can\u2019t be what it used to be because you have to miss time.\u201dTennis fans and his fellow players would prefer if he did not miss so much time.\u201cI mean, every tournament is better when Roger\u2019s there,\u201d Sam Querrey said. \u201cIt\u2019s the little things in the locker room \u2014 he\u2019s nice to all the guys. When his matches are on TV, everyone watches. He single-handedly draws thousands and thousands of fans and fills up stadiums. He\u2019s totally a positive influence and I\u2019m personally bummed he\u2019s not going to be there the rest of the year. I like having him around.\u201dTold that Federer\u2019s knee problem had recurred, Ga\u00ebl Monfils shook his head and said, \u201cI love Roger, so obviously I\u2019m very sorry for him.\u201dMonfils has been sidelined with knee problems several times during his career and was forced to miss the 2012 London Olympics.\u201cFor sure, we use our knees very much, every surface, every court,\u201d Monfils said, adding that his rehabilitation involved daily treatment and a mentality not to rush back. \u201cSometimes it takes a long time to feel 100 percent.\u201dBefore Wimbledon in June, nearly five months after his surgery, Federer was still emotional when talking about it.\u201cI was very, very sad, just because I thought I was going to be lucky not having to do surgery in my career,\u201d he said.\u201cGoing into surgery was difficult,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hit me. I just got really disappointed and sad about it because that\u2019s when I really understood what the road was going to look like.\u201dThe third-ranked Federer will drop significantly in the rankings by missing several months. He played only seven tournaments this year, compiling a 21-7 record, and failed to win a title for the first time since 2000.Federer reached the final in Brisbane and the semifinals of the Australian Open to begin the season, but after what he described in June as \u201cone stupid move,\u201d everything changed.\u201cThe season\u2019s been completely different than what I expected it to be,\u201d he said.Federer has dismissed talk of retirement and struck an optimistic tone in his statement Tuesday, closing by saying, \u201cI am as motivated as ever and plan to put all my energy towards coming back strong, healthy and in shape to play attacking tennis in 2017.\u201dHarvey Araton contributed reporting from Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Turkey Coup Unfolded, \u2018the Whole Night Felt Like Doomsday\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 Thousands of soldiers and officers purged from the military. A helicopter shot down over the capital. Hundreds of people lying dead on city streets.As dawn broke Saturday, the citizens of Turkey emerged sleep-deprived and angst-ridden after a night of violence that felt more like life in war-stricken neighbors like Syria or Iraq.And trying to assert control was President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, targeting plotters in the previous night\u2019s coup and other perceived enemies of the state.The embattled president, after a confusing absence in the early hours of the coup, appeared to speak to the nation early Saturday. He exhorted his followers with the FaceTime app from his cellphone, resorting to the kind of medium he has long sought to suppress.That stunning scene, televised nationwide, at first seemed an embarrassment for a leader who presents himself as all-powerful and suggested his end.But it was actually the turning point, as Mr. Erdogan called on his followers to take to the streets and gather at the airport in Istanbul, which the military had shut down, to resist the coup.The attempted coup, as it unfolded, suggested an alarming unraveling for a country that is seen in the West as a crucial partner in the fight against terrorism and an anchor of stability in a region full of trouble.The United States has sought close cooperation with Turkey in the fight against the Islamic State, while Europe has relied on Turkey to help stem the flow of refugees from war-torn countries of the Middle East to the Continent.\u201cThe whole night felt like doomsday,\u201d said Sibel Samli, an independent film producer in Istanbul. \u201cPeople flocked to the markets to get bread, eggs and water. People were going to cash machines to draw out cash.\u201dA steamy Friday was just getting going when the first hint came that something was not right: The military sealed off two bridges across the Bosporus.Then, fighter jets and helicopters began flying low over Istanbul and Ankara, rattling residents enjoying a night on the town, and sporadic gunshots rang out.Suddenly, Turks were transfixed by their cellphones, or the televisions in bars and restaurants, trying to figure out what was going on.No one seemed to know where the president was.As rumors swirled that the military was maneuvering to thwart a terror plot, or that a hijacked airliner was in the sky, many Turks, given their nation\u2019s history of military meddling in politics, began to wonder if a coup was afoot.14 PhotosSoon enough, they had their answer: The prime minister, Binali Yildirm, spoke on television and said a renegade faction within the military was trying to mount a coup.And a military group, later calling itself the Peace at Home Council \u2014 a reference to a mantra of Turkey\u2019s secular founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk \u2014 issued a statement saying it had seized control of the country.And so began a surreal evening that stretched until daybreak, punctuated by violence that killed at least 265 people, most of them members of the security forces, as various factions fought each other for control of the country.The night seemed to encapsulate the many dramas and conflicts that have roiled Turkey in recent years: street protests; the bitter fight between Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist, and a onetime ally, the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the president late in the night blamed for the coup attempt; and rising political violence and terrorism.Ms. Samli had been sitting with friends at a rooftop bar of a chic hotel on the European side of Istanbul when a helicopter passed low over their heads.\u201cWe didn\u2019t think anything of it at first because we knew the city was on high terror alerts following recent attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we started getting the calls and WhatsApp notifications about the start of a military coup. People were calling one another telling them go home.\u201dThe first signs that the coup might not succeed came as it become clear that the military failed to secure important government buildings, or to seize elected officials, normally the first actions of a putsch.Later it was learned that the conspirators had sought out Mr. Erdogan at the seaside town of Marmaris, where he was apparently vacationing, but were too late. And then Mr. Erdogan himself appeared, from an undisclosed location, and spoke to the nation on FaceTime.Once again \u2014 as he did when he faced down a widespread street revolt in 2013 and to win elections, for himself as president and in Parliament for his Islamist Justice and Development Party \u2014 Mr. Erdogan relied on his power base of Turkey\u2019s religious conservatives.Mosque preachers joined Mr. Erdogan\u2019s call to resist.\u201cWe will not let Turkey fall!\u201d men shouted in the conservative Istanbul neighborhood of Istinye on Saturday morning, firing guns in to the air. \u201cGod is greatest!\u201dThe scariest hour was the one just before Mr. Erdogan\u2019s jet landed in Istanbul after 3 a.m. Fighter jets flew low over Istanbul, setting off sonic booms that felt like airstrikes. Gunfire crackled throughout the city and in Ankara, where soldiers seized civilian cars to use as barricades. Several explosions were reported at Parliament, and a helicopter used by the plotters was blown from the sky, officials said. A helicopter landed at the offices of CNN Turk, and soldiers, apparently coup plotters, tried to seize the station during a live broadcast.\u201cAround 3 a.m. we heard loud fighter jets and explosions,\u201d said Ms. Samli, the film producer in Istanbul. \u201cThat\u2019s when I felt scared. And this morning, everyone is in shock. Everyone is trying to work out what happened.\u201dLate in the night, as the sounds of war mixed with muezzins at mosques exhorting people to go into the streets and people chanting \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d or \u201cGod is greatest,\u201d Turkey\u2019s cities felt like besieged cities in Iraq or Syria.When Mr. Erdogan landed in Istanbul, chaos was still gripping Istanbul and Ankara, with more explosions and gunshots, but his very appearance seemed to signify that the conspiracy was reaching its end.9 PhotosIn characteristic fashion, as he has when confronted with street protests and a corruption investigation, he vowed to root out the conspirators.\u201cThis attempt, this move, is a great favor from God to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because this move will allow us to clean up the armed forces, which needs to be completely clean.\u201dIt was becoming clear, by the time Mr. Erdogan landed in Istanbul, that those behind the coup did not have enough support within the military, even as the whole episode exposed deep divisions within the military that had not been so apparent.While the Turkish military has a history of intervening in politics \u2014 it carried out three coups in the past five decades \u2014 Mr. Erdogan and his allies had systematically sought to coup-proof the army through a series of sensational trials, and it was thought not able to mount a takeover of the government.Officials said the main plotters were from the gendarmerie, a military-style police force; the air force; and some elements of the land forces. Several generals and colonels were arrested \u2014 none high-level figures recognizable to the public \u2014 and thousands of rank-and-file officers and soldiers were rounded up Saturday in a purge that is likely to go one for some time.\u201cAll of these guys will go to prison for life,\u201d said Ilnur Cevik, an aide to Mr. Erdogan, in a telephone interview Saturday afternoon.As the night wore on, some Turks, underscoring the hold that conspiracy theories have on Turkish society, believed the whole thing was a hoax or something staged by Mr. Erdogan so he could ride to the rescue. That would give himself a pretext to crack down even further on his perceived enemies and pursue more power by establishing an executive presidency.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if it was real or a hoax,\u201d Ms. Samli said. \u201cPeople around us were saying that it was a staged coup orchestrated by President Erdogan to help him obtain more power over the country.\u201dYounger Turks panicked after seeing older Turks, who have lived through coups and the street violence that has come with them, react with horror.\u201cWe had barely recovered from the Istanbul airport terrorist attack and now everyone has started talking about a civil war,\u201d said Esra Goksu, 32, an artist who lives in Istanbul. \u201cHundreds of people died for what? One man\u2019s ego? It breaks my heart. I don\u2019t recognize my country anymore. I want to leave.\u201dAfter daybreak on Saturday, when it was apparent that the coup attempt had failed, central Istanbul was eerily quiet. There was little sign of security forces, which are usually out in force at any sign of trouble, sealing streets and lining up at intersections while backed by armored vehicles.But there were signs of life, as workers hauled trash, shops and cafes began opening, and a group of religious men on mopeds motored down Istiklal Avenue, the city\u2019s main pedestrian street, waving the Turkish flag and chanting, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201dAcross the city, the police began rounding up suspected plotters, and soldiers who had taken control of the Bosporus Bridge the night before began surrendering, leaving equipment and clothing strewn about.\u201cWhen I was waking up, I was thinking, \u2018Was this a nightmare, or did we really witness these things?\u2019\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is the chairman of the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies, a research organization in Istanbul.Mr. Ulgen said of the intrigue Friday night and Saturday morning: \u201cIt was clearly a junta within the military that staged a botched coup attempt.\u201dBut, he said, given that those arrested so far did not appear to be of the highest rank in the military, \u201cit shows how little support the coup had within the top brass of the military.\u201dWith Turkish society so deeply polarized, with about half the country supporting Mr. Erdogan and the other half bitterly opposed, a refusal to return to the dark days of military coups seemed to be one thing that united them as the episode unfurled over night.While the military factions clearly did not have enough support within the military to finish the job, they also appeared to miscalculate how the plot would be received by those who have long wished to see the end of Mr. Erdogan and his government.The coup plotters, Mr. Ulgen said, appeared to \u201cgrossly misjudge the sentiments of the Turkish people, which over time, despite Turkey\u2019s own democratic shortcomings, have turned very anti-military intervention.\u201dUnder Mr. Erdogan, Turkey has cracked down severely on journalists, sending many to jail and charging others with insulting Mr. Erdogan, a crime in Turkey. But ultimately, in many ways, it was modern media that helped Mr. Erdogan fend off the coup.As the coup unfolded, he was able to communicate with the country over FaceTime, and it was anti-coup coverage of a number of Turkish outlets that, analysts said, helped sway the tide of public opinion and allow government officials a platform to communicate with the public. Among those outlets was CNN Turk, which has faced the wrath of the government over coverage officials believe to be pro-Kurdish.The coup plotters seemed stuck in the 1970s, having seized, for a time, the state broadcaster TRT, while other news channels continued coverage, opposing the coup.

{"Headline": "String of Attacks in Europe Fuels a Summer of Anxiety", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Nearly every day seems to bring a new horror to the streets of Western Europe, leaving innocent men, women and children dead or broken, fueling political and social tensions and creating what some are already calling the summer of anxiety.Three of five attackers in less than two weeks professed loyalty to the Islamic State, but none appear to have been directed by the radical group, and all of the assaults seemed to blur the line between ideological terrorism and violence driven by anger, grudge or mental instability.In France, which displayed remarkable unity after two terrorist attacks in 2015, there has been growing political infighting and finger-pointing since the July 14 attack in Nice that killed 84 people. In Germany, the latest attacks have further strained ties between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative party and its ally in the southern state of Bavaria, where there has long been simmering opposition to her decision last year to admit one million asylum seekers.Finding answers is in part a familiar security and intelligence challenge. But it is also in some cases a problem of immigration, assimilation and tolerance. And it is a reminder of the lure of the burst of fame, or infamy, available to troubled, violence-prone people in an age of social media and instant global communication.\u201cIf you turn every individual into a self-contained agent, some will take unpleasant initiatives and act out their fantasies in real time, but they still feel the need for an anchoring identity,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.For some, he said, that is jihad. \u201cIt can happen in Orlando and Nice,\u201d he said, \u201cand without a lot of prior consultation or structure or networking.\u201dMr. Sonboly was acting not as a state or an organization but as an individual, and individual actors are extremely hard for security services to stop. Yet their individual acts, captured on smartphones and sent around the world, can resonate louder than any gunshot or explosion.The attack in Nice, France, was carried out by a Tunisian-born man with a rented truck. It has set off a new battle over blame and added another volatile element to the early stages of a presidential campaign where the governing Socialists, led by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, are falling further behind the right and far-right.There is vivid anger at what appears to be the inability of the government to keep people safe. The local government in Nice, which leans right, issued a blunt broadside against the Socialist government and specifically the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, for failing to have adequate security in place on Bastille Day. Mr. Cazeneuve was also accused of pressuring the local government to massage the numbers to make it appear that there were more safety provisions in place.Mr. Cazeneuve called the allegations part of a \u201cvile\u201d and \u201ccalumnious\u201d campaign to defame him and his ministry, but his job may be on the line.In Germany, three of the four recent attacks have been carried out by recent immigrants, two of them Syrian, and all of them Muslims. Three of the four were in Bavaria, which was the first reception center for more than a million migrants last year seeking asylum, and where the governing Christian Socialists have been an early and persistent opponent to Ms. Merkel\u2019s open-door policy, despite their close alignment to her Christian Democrats.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.With elections next year, Ms. Merkel remains largely popular. But the attacks by migrants \u2014 however disturbed or unbalanced the attackers may have been \u2014 added to the continuing ramifications of the sexual assault allegations against migrants on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne, have raised the risk of increased anti-Muslim prejudice and increased doubts about the efficiency of the police and security services.The German far-right party, Alternative for Germany, has been divided, but this spate of attacks could help the party, which under a new leader, Frauke Petry, has shifted to emphasize issues like opposition to Islam and immigration. With seats in eight state parliaments, the party is expected to gain seats in the Bundestag, or national parliament, next year.The national political reactions are playing out against a backdrop of global change in which terrorism is only one element.\u201cThe world has been changing and we see that manifested in many ways, with new power centers, the power of the individual and the corporation, the disenfranchised finding a new voice and a sense that the governing infrastructure is no longer fit for purpose in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Xenia Wickett of Chatham House, a London foreign-policy research institution.Institutions, she said, are struggling to deal with new challenges from Islam, inequality, terrorism and globalization. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to manage that change and people don\u2019t like change,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the new normal, and it makes us very anxious until we can find a new one.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the type of knife used in one of the attacks in Western Europe, using information from the police. It was a kebab knife, not a machete.Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Everything I Learned From Prof. Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byTHIS is a story about how Donald Trump broke my brain.I was supposed to be there, reporting on what was happening, but still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was bearing witness to something I wasn\u2019t meant to see. Something I knew had been happening for a long time, but really did not want to experience up close.I stood in the middle of the street between the two factions of kids, timidly jotting down the crowd\u2019s chants and snatches of conversation in my notebook, until a police officer asked me to pick a side of the street to stand on. The two groups continued to hurl insults at one another, not really listening to what the other side was saying, until the officers hustled the crowds back to their cars.Over and over during this election, we\u2019ve witnessed moments \u2014 either in person or through the filter of various screens \u2014 that seemed preposterous. Moments that made even the most hard-core political cynics raise their eyebrows and say: \u201cReally? This is actually happening?\u201dAlmost everyone who supposedly knows how the inner machinations of politics works \u2014 the pundits, the pollsters, the political scientists and data wizards \u2014 turned out to be embarrassingly wrong about the Republican primary. I was wrong, too, but at least I was in good company.The Trump campaign has almost single-handedly blown up a key piece of conventional wisdom in American politics. Some of them were already on their way out, but the Trump campaign lit the fuse. Virtually everything I\u2019ve been taught to look for \u2014 every sure sign that a campaign is succeeding or failing \u2014 has turned out to be irrelevant. Mr. Trump had no political experience, no real campaign operation, no ground game, no fund-raising apparatus and no institutional support within his own party. He was the distinctively coifed canary in the coal mine of American two-party politics. And he has survived longer than almost anybody thought possible.In the interest of putting my own brain back together again, here are five rules Donald Trump has broken, and how he pulled it off.An influential 2008 work of political science, \u201cThe Party Decides,\u201d argued that the elite members of the two main political parties exert a lot of control over who becomes their presidential nominee. Those nominees, the theory goes, usually end up being candidates the party sees as broadly electable. This is how we come to get likable-enough candidates that both party leaders and voters can tolerate, if not jump for joy over (see: Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton). Over the years, party leaders internalized \u201cthe party decides\u201d mantra to the point where they couldn\u2019t see that what their voters wanted was vastly different from what the party was offering.This year\u2019s slate of Republican presidential candidates included well-funded senators and governors, along with three non-politicians. Yet a tragedy of the commons played out in the Republican primary. Every other Republican campaign wanted Mr. Trump out of the race, but each wanted to be the last candidate standing against him.After weathering plenty of criticism over their book, the authors of \u201cThe Party Decides\u201d are coming out with a new study that analyzes Mr. Trump\u2019s success in the Republican primary.\u201cThe problem on the Republican side is not so much that voters were not subject to persuasion, because Republican leaders made little effort to persuade them. Republican leaders said they didn\u2019t like Trump, but they gave little signal about who they did like,\u201d Hans Noel of Georgetown University, one of the book\u2019s authors, said by email. \u201cThey tried very hard to stop Trump, but we argue that they usually try very hard to help someone in particular. They didn\u2019t do that. We would have thought they would have made a choice, but they did not.\u201dThe phrase \u201cAll politics is local,\u201d made famous by the former House speaker Tip O\u2019Neill, is a well-worn saying among political reporters and strategists. The idea is that people care about the issues that affect them the most, and candidates have to meet voters where they live.Every United States president so far has had some form of government or military experience. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has less political experience than a Model United Nations delegate. That mattered little to the Republican voters whose anti-establishment sentiment catalyzed the Tea Party movement in 2010.\u201cTrump benefited from a populist strain in the party that has been growing for decades,\u201d said Tim Miller, who was Jeb Bush\u2019s communications director and now works for an anti-Trump \u201csuper PAC.\u201d \u201cYou could see this coming for a long time; it just had to reach critical mass and the right conditions. The Democrats are in an embryonic stage of this same phenomenon right now.\u201dOffice holders have long enjoyed a distinct advantage: Voters tend to re-elect incumbents, unless that incumbent did something particularly bad. But according to the Emory study, the partisanship of a given district is becoming a better predictor of who will win a given congressional race than incumbency.The Trump campaign has shown that, under the right circumstances, political experience isn\u2019t just overrated; it can actually be a detriment.As political reporters, we are taught that gaffes \u2014 the ill-advised comments that sometimes tumble out of a politician\u2019s mouth \u2014 matter. In the 2012 election, no moment better exemplified this rule than Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d remarks, in which he seemed to dismiss almost half of the country\u2019s voters. Though it\u2019s unclear whether that specific gaffe was what doomed his campaign, Mr. Romney was subject to the laws of political gravity in ways that Donald Trump has not yet been.Mr. Trump\u2019s first speech as a presidential candidate included the argument that Mexican immigrants are drug mules, rapists and murderers. He didn\u2019t stop there. In the past year, he has racked up a slate of gaffes that would be political ruin 100 times over for another candidate.But the Republican Party has self-selected its way into being nearly gaffe-proof, as long as you don\u2019t insult actual Republican primary voters. Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to spew hateful words about women, Muslims, refugees, African-Americans and Latinos became an asset, not a liability, among his core group of fans. That tendency didn\u2019t affect his performance in the primary, because the people voting in the primary weren\u2019t offended by what he said.Moderate Republicans and party leaders have been horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, in part because he has revealed an uncomfortable truth about their own party: At a national level, it is racial resentment \u2014 not fiscal conservatism, or small-government ideology or family values \u2014 that is driving their party\u2019s voters. Now, those leaders can either make their peace with that resentment and continue winning elections with smaller and smaller slices of the electorate, or wash their hands of Trumpism and set off into the wilderness to write some new rules.Advertisement"}

On Monday, Mr. Lima was attacked and killed inside the Pav\u00f3n prison, Interior Minister Francisco Rivas said at a news conference. Twelve other people, including an Argentine model, Joanna Birriel, who was visiting Mr. Lima, were killed in ensuing unrest at the prison.The police retook control of the prison late in the afternoon.Mr. Rivas said the attack had been planned by another inmate, Marvin Montiel Mar\u00edn, known as El Taquero, who is serving an 826-year sentence for a 2008 attack on a bus that killed 16 people. Mr. Montiel and Mr. Lima led rival groups in the prison that clashed over drug sales, prisoner transfers and internal discipline, Mr. Rivas said.Mr. Lima, 46, was serving a 20-year sentence for the 1998 murder of Bishop Juan Jos\u00e9 Gerardi, who was bludgeoned in his quarters just two days after presenting a voluminous human rights report on atrocities in the civil war.Mr. Lima\u2019s life in the military and behind bars \u2014 where he made many enemies \u2014 offers a \u201ckey illustration\u201d of how clandestine structures inside Guatemala\u2019s military \u201chave been able to morph into criminal groups that have used their connections to gain power and economic benefit, either licitly or illicitly,\u201d said Adriana Beltr\u00e1n, an expert on the country\u2019s military networks who is a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America.In 2013, Mr. Lima was stopped while traveling outside the prison, a capture that revealed he had been able to leave almost at will.The next year, the attorney general\u2019s office and Guatemala\u2019s anticorruption commission, a United Nations-backed panel of international prosecutors, charged him and the director of the prison system \u2014 a former military academy classmate \u2014 with running a vast extortion scheme.According to the panel, known as the Cicig, the racket charged prisoners for favors.Attorney General Thelma Aldana\u2019s office and the Cicig, which is led by Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, a Colombian prosecutor, have been uncovering corruption scandals that are shaking the country\u2019s political and business power structure.Last month, Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti were accused of running a scheme to give government contracts to prominent businesspeople in exchange for illegally financing the 2011 campaign.According to prosecutors, they received about $38 million in kickbacks.At a pretrial hearing in the case on Monday, Judge Miguel \u00c1ngel G\u00e1lvez announced Mr. Lima\u2019s death to the courtroom. Speaking to reporters during a break, Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina said he remained convinced of Mr. Lima\u2019s innocence in the Gerardi murder.Political tensions have been rising since the kickbacks case materialized. Last month, Ms. Aldana said she had received death threats and then suspended public activities before leaving the country for meetings in Colombia and the United States. She returned to Guatemala on Saturday.Mr. Rivas said the threats might have come from some of the suspects in the corruption cases. The kickbacks case shows how \u201ca criminal enterprise has been able to co-opt the state from within,\u201d Ms. Beltr\u00e1n said. \u201cIt has touched a lot of nerves.\u201dElisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Nic Wirtz from Guatemala City.Advertisement"}

Over much of the last year, Mr. Mu\u00f1oz has relieved the star once a week, and on other days watched the production from a stool just offstage, waiting in case Mr. Miranda ever took a tumble. (He did not.)Mr. Mu\u00f1oz has some obvious similarities to the man he is replacing \u2014 both have parents from Puerto Rico, graduated from New York City public schools and encountered Broadway as children, becoming passionate about theater. And their careers have been entwined for years \u2014 Mr. Mu\u00f1oz was Mr. Miranda\u2019s alternate, and then his successor, on \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d and has been his alternate throughout the development of \u201cHamilton.\u201dBut Mr. Mu\u00f1oz brings his own life experience to the role. The son of a doorman, he grew up in a housing project \u2014 the Linden Houses, in East New York, Brooklyn, which he recalls as scarily violent and dangerous. \u201cI can\u2019t lie \u2014 I\u2019m still afraid of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was so much fear growing up there.\u201dLast week, as he prepared to take over the role full-time, he sat down to talk about his life and \u201cHamilton\u201d at Candle 79, a vegan restaurant on the Upper East Side where he has repeatedly worked as a host between acting jobs. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What\u2019s it like to step into the lead role of the biggest musical in memory?Did you ever feel as if people wished they were seeing the other guy?I felt that way with \u201cHeights.\u201d It would take a lot to earn the audience \u2014 to be like: \u201cReally, I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t suck. Just come with me. It\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201d But with \u201cHamilton,\u201d we were at the Public, and we mapped out three shows that I was going to go on, and the days varied. It was a test, and it started with such a positive impact because of the history I have with Lin.Going on when President Obama was in the audience must have helped.That\u2019s the turning point. And it helped me feel more confident, too. To know I had their trust. I knew, but that gesture was so generous and really made me feel O.K.Why are you an actor?I decided in high school \u2014 at Edward R. Murrow in Brooklyn. I just fell in love with the idea that theater can be a mirror, theater can be a commentary, theater can be powerful and can start a conversation that needs to happen. I started working for a children\u2019s literacy organization that used theater to teach literacy in after-school programs, and that was another powerful thing \u2014 suddenly the kid who really had trouble reading in class, or was embarrassed to speak out loud because of their accent, was inhabiting a character, using their imagination, reading and writing. That blew my mind.What\u2019s the story behind a show that\u2019s become a Broadway must-see with no marquee names, no special effects and almost no white actors? Erik Piepenburg explains, in six snapshots, why \u201cHamilton\u201d has become such a big deal.Did you go to Broadway when you were growing up?I did \u2014 school trips. The first thing I saw was \u201cMe and My Girl.\u201d And I loved it so much \u2014 I was singing \u201cThe Lambeth Walk\u201d for weeks. After that, any time there was a school trip to Lincoln Center, or anything that was arts related, I was so into it.What happened with your health last fall? How did you know you had cancer?I have been living with H.I.V. since 2002, and I\u2019m undetectable. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m strong and I\u2019m very out about that because of the stigma still attached to it. But I\u2019ve had a healthy fear about my health since I tested positive, and I asked how to test myself for lumps, because both my parents had cancer. And very early on in my learning how to do a self-examination, I found the lump. I wasn\u2019t immediately worried because of where it was \u2014 and I do want to keep that private because that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s mine in this. But I brought it up to my doc, and that\u2019s what led to further testing and discovery.You didn\u2019t want to tell anyone at \u201cHamilton\u201d? I was filling myself with disappointment, as if you can blame yourself for cancer. But that\u2019s a thing, you know. I had to reveal it, and then I had to own that I needed help, and I had to ask for help, and that was the hardest thing in the world.You express a lot of gratitude on social media.I have this joke \u2014 if it\u2019s funny or not funny, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but the joke is that I have died several times already, and that\u2019s how it feels. My life completely and drastically changed in 2002 when I was diagnosed with H.I.V., and then again last year with cancer. And you can\u2019t unknow what you know. Life is not the same after that. But I\u2019m alive, and I\u2019m for all intents and purposes healthy and well. And I\u2019m grateful for that.You planted a garden on the roof of Richard Rodgers, the theater where \u201cHamilton\u201d is performed.There\u2019s so much energy on the stage, there are so many things we\u2019re doing day in and day out, and I needed something there that felt still and calm, and gardening gives me that stillness and that calmness. Also, I\u2019m growing something. And it may sound cheesy or corny, but it\u2019s really not. The fact that life is created in that little garden bed heals me. It just does.How many shows a week will you do?Seven. It\u2019s the same structure. [For the eighth performance] someone else gets to be sexy \u2014 I\u2019m going to go eat pizza.Advertisement"}

The San Francisco-based company has long courted events like the Oscars and the Grammys, during which online conversations across Twitter are regular occurrences.Over the last year, Twitter has been the focus of criticism that it lacks product direction and a coherent strategic plan to attract new users to the service. The company\u2019s stock price has fallen by half over the last 12 months, and user growth has stagnated at roughly 310 million regular monthly visitors.Twitter also faces competition from Facebook, which has doubled down on its efforts to increase engagement among its 1.65 billion users with more real-time content. Facebook Live, the company\u2019s newest feature, allows viewers to live-stream themselves and broadcast directly to their friends and family on Facebook.The Twitter CBSN stream of the Republican National Convention will occur July 18 through July 21, live from Cleveland, while the Democratic National Convention will be broadcast July 25 through July 28 from Philadelphia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video of Fatal Shooting by Off-Duty Officer in Brooklyn Emerges", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byThe video was grainy, and the men on the street were blurs rendered in black and white. But the clip, recorded by a surveillance camera pointed at a Brooklyn intersection, shows a man approaching the driver\u2019s side window of a car, and then, in an instant, stumbling away before collapsing onto the pavement.Law enforcement officials said they believed that the video, which circulated late last week, showed the fatal shooting of the man, Delrawn Small, by an off-duty New York City police officer during a traffic dispute on July 4.\u201cI broke down; I couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d Zayanahla Vines, a nephew of Mr. Small, said at a protest in Manhattan on Saturday, recounting his reaction to the footage. \u201cI had to go outside and get a breath of fresh air.\u201dThe clip surfaced as the nation was grappling with videos, broadcast on television and shared widely on social media, of confrontations over the past week between black men and police officers. Mr. Small\u2019s death preceded the fatal shootings of Alton B. Sterling, who was killed early Tuesday by officers in Baton Rouge, La., and Philando Castile, who was killed on Wednesday in Falcon Heights, Minn.Unlike the other men, Mr. Small, 37, encountered the police officer, identified by law enforcement officials as Wayne Isaacs, when the officer was off duty. The Police Department said that Officer Isaacs, who is also 37, had just completed a 4-p.m.-to-midnight shift and was driving home alone.In a statement issued on Friday, Mr. Schneiderman said the video was being reviewed as part of the investigation. The video was first reported by The New York Post.\u201cAs special prosecutor, I am committed to conducting a full, fair and independent investigation of this tragedy,\u201d he said, \u201cand will follow the facts and evidence \u2014 including this video evidence \u2014 wherever they lead.\u201dShortly after midnight on July 4, the authorities said, Officer Isaacs fired his 9-millimeter service pistol after he and Mr. Small stopped at a red light on Atlantic Avenue in the Cypress Hills neighborhood of Brooklyn. Mr. Small\u2019s girlfriend and two children were in the car.According to a preliminary version of events from the police, Mr. Small got out of his car after stopping at the light, at Bradford Street, and approached Officer Isaacs, punching him through the open car window. Mr. Small was struck by three bullets, in the chest, abdomen and arm, according to the medical examiner.But in the video, there appeared to be a short window between when Mr. Small approached Officer Isaacs\u2019s car and when he recoiled from the gunfire. The attorney general\u2019s office declined to discuss the video. Law enforcement officials who have reviewed the footage said that it did not provide complete answers to what happened between the two men.Efforts to reach Officer Isaacs were unsuccessful, and the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, the union representing New York\u2019s rank-and-file police officers, declined to comment.On Saturday night, Mr. Small\u2019s name was invoked along with Mr. Sterling\u2019s and Mr. Castile\u2019s by the protesters who marched through the streets of Lower Manhattan.\u201cMy uncle was killed in cold blood by somebody that was wearing a badge, and that man is still walking free today,\u201d Mr. Vines, 22, said, addressing the hundreds of demonstrators. \u201cWe can\u2019t stand for this any longer. It\u2019s not right, and we know it\u2019s not right.\u201dWenona Small, who was married to Mr. Small, said that she was disturbed by the video and has struggled to grasp what happened. She had been separated from him for years, she said, but they had remained friends.\u201cI felt like I was being shot as I watched it,\u201d Ms. Small said. \u201cNobody deserves to die like that.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Truck Attack in Nice, Mainstay of Commerce Reinvented as Tool of Death", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byMore than five years ago, Al Qaeda called on its followers to use cars as tools of terror. Soon after, the terrorist group that had brought down the twin towers scrapped the idea, feeling that the tactic was too indiscriminate, too likely to kill Muslims.But the idea of the car as a weapon was revived by the Islamic State shortly after it broke with Al Qaeda in 2014 following years of discord over the Islamic State\u2019s brutal methods.\u201cIf you are not able to find an I.E.D. or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman or any of their allies,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a speech. \u201cSmash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car,\u201d he said, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group.10 PhotosNone of the vehicle attacks carried out in the name of the terrorist groups resulted in mass casualties, possibly because the attackers used S.U.V.s and smaller cars.And their ubiquity means that the trucks would be difficult to spot, and stop, if an attacker used one as an instrument of violence.Survivors of the attack in Nice, France, describe a windy night at the beach, fireworks, and then terror.The idea of using cars as an instrument of terror was first floated by Al Qaeda in 2010 in an article in its Inspire magazine.Featuring a picture of a heavy-duty Ford truck under the headline \u201cThe Ultimate Mowing Machine,\u201d the article compared people to grass and encouraged supporters to \u201cmow down the enemies of Allah.\u201dYet when a copy of the magazine made its way to Osama bin Laden, then the leader of Al Qaeda, he took exception to the article, according to files recovered in his compound in Pakistan, said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has spent years tracking the terrorist group. He said that bin Laden worried that using a car as a weapon would lead to indiscriminate violence, possibly killing Sunni Muslims, the very category the group was trying to win over.\u201cYou see a desire over time to calibrate their terrorism to be more targeted and to have a specific message,\u201d Mr. Joscelyn said, describing Qaeda tactics since the coordinated attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. By contrast, the message of the Islamic State is to \u201ckill anywhere and everywhere,\u201d he said.Even though Al Qaeda dropped the idea, the concept appears to have remained in the collective subconscious of the terrorist network, and it was revived by the Islamic State after its fissure with Al Qaeda in 2014 in one of the earliest speeches by Mr. Adnani.Documenting devastation along a one-mile stretch of waterfront.The Islamic State has repeated the call to use cars as weapons on several other occasions, including last November in a video tailored for an audience in France featuring three French fighters in Syria.13 Photos\u201cThere are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit,\u201d one of the French fighters says, according to SITE. \u201cKill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars. Do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them.\u201dWhether the driver of the delivery truck in Nice was acting at the behest of the terrorist group, or after being inspired by its propaganda, was unclear.On Friday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said the attacker was \u201ca terrorist who is probably linked to radical Islam one way or another.\u201dBut the authorities had not yet provided evidence of radicalization, and there had not been any sign that the attacker, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a 31-year-old immigrant from Tunisia, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, one of the group\u2019s requirements for those who wish to act in its name.The Islamic State, which has claimed attacks carried out in its name within hours of the killings, has been silent about the Nice attack. The group\u2019s daily radio bulletin on Friday made no mention of Nice. The Amaq News Agency, which acts as the group\u2019s news wire and was the first to claim the attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., as well as the recent killings in Bangladesh and in Magnanville, France, also made no mention of the deaths.However, media accounts that are closely tied to the Islamic State have cheered the killings and urged their followers to promote the atrocity on social media.Hours after the truck plowed through the crowd, the Kilafah News Channel on the encrypted phone app Telegram, which analysts believe is one of the terrorist group\u2019s official media outlets, issued a directive: \u201cTo all #Islamic State supporters we ask you to participate in these following hashtags to show the world the truth about the war on the Islamic State and how they brought this to themselves.\u201dThe channel then instructed its followers to hijack hashtags dedicated to mourning the dead in Nice, including #PrayForNice.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Convention Offers Donald Trump His Biggest Sales Opportunity", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump arrives to claim the Republican nomination here this week with a similar opening \u2014 and with a surprising consensus among members of both parties about how he should use this moment to sell himself to a skeptical electorate: by showing discipline, a detailed economic program and the maturity to lead the nation through perilous times.\u201cIf people see a different Trump, someone who has substantive plans, who\u2019s not crazy \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll forget the past few months, but he has a chance to at least shore up concerns of balking Republicans,\u201d said David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cFor Trump, they just have to arrest the bleeding. A convention is something you can control. Speakers, teleprompters, who speaks, when you speak.\u201dBut the tests confronting Mr. Trump here may be greater than those that have faced any presidential nominee at a convention in recent times. He faces the challenge of reassuring Republicans unhappy with their candidate, symbolized by the absence of so many party leaders, while using the event to expand his appeal to a broader electorate. He is balancing calls to be a more traditional and scripted candidate, while clearly relishing the dish-smashing campaign that helped carry him to the nomination.His main task \u2014 to undo the damage he has suffered in the months since primary voting ended \u2014 will not be easy. Mr. Trump, like Hillary Clinton, is already an extremely well known candidate who inspires strong opinions, many of them negative.\u201cThe electorate is so much more polarized,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton University. \u201cThere are not that many people with open minds left.\u201dWhat is more, the razzle-dazzle spectacle of a political convention that Nixon and Mr. Bush put to good use on their roads to victory, with a blur of testimonial speeches and wall-to-wall nightly network television coverage, is a thing of the past. Far more people now follow what is unfolding through the prism of real-time or second-screen commentary on cable television, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter.Mr. Trump has one more obstacle: himself.Even if he knows \u2014 or is told \u2014 what he should do to take advantage of this moment, it is unclear that he has the discipline to carry it out.\u201cWith 83 percent of voters calling Trump obnoxious, he definitely has a chance to redefine himself at the convention,\u201d said Nelson Warfield, who was a senior adviser to Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee in 1996. \u201cBut only if he can manage not to be obnoxious for four days. Probably an open question.\u201dStill, for all these obstacles, the convention will provide Mr. Trump with one of the few moments between now and November in which he can try for a reset.\u201cMy experience is that people do give a new look at the candidate, even if they are well known,\u201d said Stanley B. Greenberg, who was Bill Clinton\u2019s pollster in the 1992 presidential race. \u201cThey do get a hearing. They do get to reintroduce their biography.\u201dThat said, conventions pose risks for candidates as well. As much as Mr. Bush helped himself in 1988, his 1992 convention in Houston was marked by hard-driving conservative speeches \u2014 from Patrick J. Buchanan, among others \u2014 that permitted Democrats to portray Mr. Bush as out of step with the political mainstream. He went on to lose to Mr. Clinton.There is no shortage of advice on what Mr. Trump should do.\u201cThe most important thing you are going to do at the convention is to excite and unify and give confidence to your base,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said.Rallying the party could help accomplish a second critical task, which is convincing undecided voters that Mr. Trump is an acceptable candidate to run the nation.\u201cThey should think, \u2018If his party is backing him, then it must be O.K.,\u2019\u201d Mr. Greenberg said.Mr. Trump\u2019s alienation from many of the most prominent leaders in his party \u2014 no former Republican presidents will give speeches on his behalf \u2014 means the burden of selling the candidate will fall largely on him. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton has a parade of Democratic luminaries to give speeches on her behalf, including President Obama, her husband and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator whom Mrs. Clinton defeated for the nomination.Mr. Zelizer said Mr. Trump would be wise to \u201cdo the opposite of shaking things up.\u201d\u201cCalm things down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one image that he needs to come out of it is someone who can be calm and reasonable and show a kind of gravitas he just hasn\u2019t showed yet. He has to deliver this kind of very sober, serious address.\u201dSteve Schmidt, a senior adviser to Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, said a convention speech offered a chance to deal directly with mistakes the candidate had made \u2014 an opportunity Mr. Trump should seize.\u201cYou go in fully aware of your weaknesses,\u201d he said, \u201cand you try to fix them.\u201d\u201cHe could say, \u2018The law of the land is marriage equality,\u2019\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cYou are trying to create an opening for moderate voters who might consider him. Probably the social issues are the ones that he could most plausibly do that with.\u201dHe could also use his speech to lay out the kind of agenda that he has mostly not done in the campaign.\u201cOn the national security front, he hasn\u2019t done anything to raise confidence in his ability to be commander in chief of the nuclear arsenal,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said.Mr. Gingrich said one of the most effective things Mr. Trump could do would be to spotlight his differences with Mrs. Clinton on a variety of issues, like immigration and national security.\u201cTrump has to pick those kinds of fights,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to draw a contrast with Hillary on issues that matter to the American people, where on core issues she would be unacceptable.\u201d\u201cA lot of politicians\u2019 kids belong in cages,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cHis kids really seem to have it together, so you look to spotlight his family as character witnesses, who define who he is.\u201dMr. Gingrich said he expected Mr. Trump\u2019s family to help introduce him \u201cin a more complex way than anyone has seen until now.\u201dWhether Mr. Trump recognizes the potential of this moment \u2014 and turns it to his full advantage \u2014 may be the most important question hanging over the week, and looming over his performance at the convention\u2019s Thursday night culmination in particular.\u201cDoes he have the ability in the speech to show a side of him that we haven\u2019t seen before?\u201d Mr. Schmidt asked. \u201cNot to see the clenched fists, but the open hands. Very few Americans have the opportunity to address the American people like this, in numbers that amount to tens of millions of people an hour.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of a pollster who worked for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential race.

Against a plain backdrop duct-taped to a wall, he shows them looking right at you, engaging your gaze and your heart. They have T-shirts with slogans or photos of their missing sons, who have been missing since September 2014. Some have a tattoo or charm of a turtle, the mascot of the Ayotzinapa Normal School, where many of the students had just started their journey from impoverished campesino to future teacher.The parents have marched and spoken out against the government and police corruption, decrying the violence that has wracked their nation and torn asunder their families. Not surprisingly, the turtle means a lot more now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAyotzinapa is the place of the turtle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Guill\u00c3\u00a9n Lozano said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike justice, it is slow, but implacable. It does not matter to how long it will take. The parents want justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Guill\u00c3\u00a9n Lozano, 24, was a student at the Universidad del Valle de M\u00c3\u00a9xico in Mexico City when the 43 disappeared. During his own college years, he had photographed many demonstrations against the narco-fueled violence, where waves of people would go from the Angel of Independence to the Z\u00c3\u00b3calo. Often, the marchers were indigenous people from deep in the countryside. They were the kind of people whom politicians thought were easy to dismiss.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople would criticize them as having nothing better to do except protest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Guill\u00c3\u00a9n Lozano said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, \u2018More than attention, they want help with their situation.\u2019 People from deep inside Mexico, they have all either been victims of violence or know someone who was a victim. The government now prefers not to talk about the violence or deny it even exists.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe plight of the missing students and their parents led him to change his own postcollege plans. When his mother gave him a graduation gift of some money for a party and maybe a brief vacation, he took it, bought a camera and headed to the area around Ayotzinapa. He has taken many trips there, chronicling scenes at the school, protests at various communities as well as portraits of the parents and the home altars they have set up in honor of their children (whom some hope are still alive, despite all indications to the contrary). The intensity and tenacity of the protests \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in one town they actually prevented elections last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reflect the extreme dissatisfaction among indigenous groups who have been long pushed to the side.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are among the most marginalized class in Mexico,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Guill\u00c3\u00a9n Lozano said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are not just poor, but impoverished. They come from the most remote sons of Guerrero, the mountains and the coast. These are students whose mothers and sisters have been raped by the military.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs a result, their parents pinned their hopes on these young men. The students, he said, went to a school where radical politics and a critical worldview spurred them to action. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Guerrero, you either keep being poor or do something not to be poor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Guill\u00c3\u00a9n Lozano said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat means for some to get into the narcotics trade, since they grow poppies in the region. These young men took a more reasoned option. They decided to go to school to become teachers to get ahead, not just for themselves but for their families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, those families have taken it upon themselves to continue their quest, through regular protests, joining search parties to comb the countryside for remains, and refusing to accept the government version of events that drug cartels killed and incinerated the students. Some of the families now live at the school itself, where 43 chairs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 each with a photo of a missing student \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are arrayed on a basketball court. In their homes, altars are set by the entrance, to remind them of their mission as they leave for the day in the hope that one day, at least a body may be found and buried, so their loved one may be mourned and honored.That, to Mr. Guill\u00c3\u00a9n Lozano, seems as elusive as justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the real Mexico, not the Mexico of the government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say in Mexico you are born to disappear or be disappeared.

{"Headline": "On Dallas Streets, Fearful Bystanders and Chilling Historical Echoes", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 The hundreds of demonstrators were in the middle of a call and response: \u201cHands Up! Don\u2019t Shoot!\u201d Some held their hands up in solidarity, some held up colorful posters, some held children\u2019s hands, others walked casually as if on a stroll. It was late twilight, the sky a cobalt blue and the overnight lights on in the downtown buildings.And then the resounding pop-pop-pop of gunfire began.It was about two blocks from the red-brick building that was the site of one of the most indelible tragedies in American history, and it was happening again.Just down the street from what used to be the Texas School Book Depository, Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s perch when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, what had been a peaceful march protesting police violence Thursday turned into a scene that looked like a video from the Middle East. Gunfire echoed off downtown buildings. The air was punctuated by shouts and screams of people fleeing for their lives. Adults and children ran for cover, falling over one another.Many marchers had passed the intersection of Main and Lamar Streets. The protest had been so amicable that the Dallas Police had tweeted upbeat pictures of the demonstration, with some officers posing with marchers.David Bonifay, managing editor of The Dallas Weekly, a paper covering African-American issues, was on Commerce Street, near Dallas\u2019s Kennedy memorial and toward the back of the marching crowd, when he heard what sounded like firecrackers.\u201cThen there was like a full two seconds, a very eerie, weird pause, where there were people sort of looking around \u2014 and then screams from the front,\u201d he said. The marchers at the front of the line began running back toward him.\u201cActive shooter!\u201d they yelled. \u201cThey\u2019re shooting people.\u201dA sniper was firing on officers with a military-style weapon, the bullets apparently raining down from an elevated position.It was playing out in the heart of Dallas\u2019s downtown, an area of hotels, restaurants and businesses. Soon helicopters were whirring overhead and officers with automatic rifles were patrolling the streets.Cellphone videos recorded the chaotic scene as it unfolded with demonstrators, first stunned, then terrified, dashing for cover and police officers crouching behind vehicles or running to rescue officers who were already down as the gunshots came in rapid bursts.The marchers scattered, some scrambling behind cars, others screaming. \u201cIt became very confusing, and people were almost literally running in every direction,\u201d said Mr. Bonifay, 30. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t quite know what was going on.\u201dFive officers were killed and seven others were shot during a protest in downtown Dallas.He later adds: \u201cThey just dragged one of the officers up into this police car right here. And there\u2019s somebody else down over there.\u201dWhen the shots rang out, a local activist, Changa Higgins, 42, was in the middle of the pack. He had brought his two sons, ages 15 and 18. \u201cI ran back to where I thought they would be and they weren\u2019t there, which was horrifying,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were not there.\u201dHis frantic search lasted five minutes \u2014 \u201cor it felt like five minutes,\u201d he said. Eventually he helped them take cover behind a car.Tyler Lea, 28, a project manager who had been watching the march from a downtown bar, followed the noise of the pops to see what was happening. What he found was chaos, people running and trying to understand what was happening. He recalled the sound of dozens of gunshots, the arrival of a SWAT team and the sound of a helicopter overhead. But what he really remembered was the smell.\u201dThe smell of gunpowder finally got me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to war, but it\u2019s what I imagine it smells like.\u201dAs protesters fled, two suspects were arrested near the parking garage of nearby El Centro College and another was cornered by the police inside the garage. After a few hours of intense negotiations with the suspect, which included exchanges of gunfire, the police sent a robot with a bomb into the garage and detonated the explosive, killing the suspect.On Friday morning, the area was cordoned off and people were stunned. Outside the Donut Palace, usually busy, now almost empty, the police had placed small numbered cones marking blood spots from the carnage.Fifty-plus years ago, the gunman in Dallas was a troubled ex-Marine with a mail order rifle. This time, the police said it was a troubled former Army reservist with more serious weaponry who was identified as Micah Johnson, 25.Dallas is an extraordinarily different place from what it was in 1963. Then it was majority white and overwhelmingly conservative with a population of about 700,000. Today, it is majority-minority, with nearly twice as many people. More than 70 languages are spoken in the public schools.In many ways Mohamed Elibiary, 41, exemplifies the new Dallas: He is an Egyptian-born Muslim who moved to the United States at age 8. Today he is a conservative Republican who runs a security consulting firm, Lone Star Intelligence, and is fiercely proud of his city.Mr. Elibiary said he was \u201cin mourning\u201d for both the slain officers and the potential harm to Dallas\u2019s reputation. \u201cI feel like we do not deserve this as a city,\u201d he said.Others were concerned about the shooting\u2019s effect on day-to-day life here. Tension between the police and minorities are lower in Dallas than some comparable cities. But Cintearrea Tolbert, 29, who works at Wells Fargo, said that despite some improvements, African-Americans like her were still subjects of racial profiling by officers in the various police jurisdictions in and around Dallas. Now she was wondering if the place would pull together \u2014 or come apart.\u201cWe are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this going to make officers react differently to us? Is it going to go back to how it used to be, or is it going to get better?\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just have to pray.\u201dAnd, amid the grief, others found their own way to make sense of the tragedy. So after a prayer service Friday in Thanks-Giving Square Park downtown, people cheered the city\u2019s police chief, David O. Brown. And then they lined up to offer long, heartfelt hugs to the officers who were there.Richard Fausset reported from Dallas, and Campbell Robertson from New Orleans.Richard Fausset reported from Dallas, and Campbell Robertson from New Orleans.

{"Headline": "C.E.O.s Meet in Secret Over the Sorry State of Public Companies", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byWarren E. Buffett quietly walked through the lobby of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters on Park Avenue in Manhattan last summer and was ushered up to the 49th floor by a security guard, trying to avoid drawing too much attention. Laurence D. Fink, chairman of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager \u2014 with more than $4 trillion \u2014 soon was also escorted upstairs. Abby Johnson, the chief executive of Fidelity (which invests more than $2 trillion), and Frederick William McNabb III, chief of Vanguard ($3 trillion), were also shepherded to the elevator.In all, the parade included about a dozen chief executives of investment firms \u2014 T. Rowe Price, State Street \u2014 plus the head of a public pension fund and an activist investor. All had arrived for a meeting that they were told they would absolutely have to keep secret.When they reached the 49th floor, they were met by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon.The agenda \u2014 shaped over many conversations Mr. Dimon had had with his friend, Mr. Buffett \u2014 was to discuss the sorry state of publicly traded companies: too little trust and connection between shareholders and management, too many rules imposed by so-called governance experts and too many idiosyncratic accounting guidelines. As a result, much of the smart money in the United States is going \u2014 and staying \u2014 private, creating more companies that have less public accountability and transparency.Over a series of meetings, conference calls and email exchanges that later included the chiefs of General Motors, General Electric and Verizon, among others, the group discussed a series of corporate governance \u201cprinciples\u201d that the participants could all agree on: Topics included compensation for chief executives and board members (more payment in stock, less cash) and earnings guidance (the group is generally not a fan). Along the way, at least two major investors, Fidelity and Wellington Management, dropped out, refusing to sign the list of \u201cprinciples.\u201dOn Thursday, the group will release the culmination of its work in an open letter and detailed report that includes its list of principles \u2014 which are intended to stir a conversation within the business community.The report includes some recommendations that will seem ordinary; they suggest that the boards of public companies should be diverse. But other suggestions, including one that seems to say many public companies should not offer earnings guidance, may be more surprising.Another principle takes on companies that use accounting methods that exclude stock-based compensation from non-GAAP earnings. The group asserts that stock-based compensation is \u201cplainly a cost of doing business.\u201dThe group generally disapproved of companies with dual-class voting, in which people with a privileged category of shares get more say than the average investor. (Examples of companies set up this way include Facebook and The New York Times.) The group said, \u201cIf a company has dual-class voting, which sometimes is intended to protect the company from short-term behavior, the company should consider having specific sunset provisions based upon time or a triggering event, which eliminate dual-class voting.\u201dThe report also includes a recommendation that may upset chief executives who like to keep a firm grasp on the chain of command and distance between management and the board: The group says that the board of a public company should be able to meet with any employees outside of the presence of the chief executive to get an unvarnished view of the way the company is being run.The group also decided that if a company did not have two people acting as chairman and chief executive to act as a check on each other, a strong lead director should be chosen.The principles are considered suggestions, not requirements. \u201cThese recommendations are not meant to be absolute,\u201d the group wrote. (While various members of the group were willing to be interviewed about the project, they all did so on condition of anonymity.)The idea for starting the series of meetings grew out of a frustration Mr. Dimon had about public companies. Talented executives have left public companies in droves to work at private companies \u2014 outside the harsh spotlight of the stock market, activist investors and new regulations. Many Silicon Valley companies have sought to delay public offerings for as long as possible.Publicly listed companies in the United States have become something of a dying breed. In 1996, there were 8,025 public listed companies in the United States; by 2012, the number of companies was about half: 4,101, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.Mr. Dimon had been on the phone with Mr. Buffett lamenting what he described as the broken system for public companies and corporate governance when he asked him if he would help convene a group of the nation\u2019s largest companies and investors to see if they could fix the problem.One of questions posed to the group: \u201cIf you inherited the company you now run and had to hire someone else to manage it, how would you set up its governance?\u201d It was a blue-sky question and the answers were very different from what many governance experts expect of public companies today.During the meetings, according to several who participated but said they agreed not to speak publicly, some members of the group said that rather than maintaining a board of a dozen or more people, as most public companies do, they\u2019d have only a handful of board members, all of them experts in the business: fewer academics and consultants, more industry professionals.Many in the group said they wished they could persuade shareholders not to push for \u2014 and boards not to enact \u2014 requirements that that board members retire by a certain age; if Mr. Buffett were on your board, why wouldn\u2019t you want him to stay?And many agreed that the board members should be compensated in large part in stock instead of cash; one of the group\u2019s published principles is that board members should be receive at least half of their compensation in stock.Despite the moratorium on speaking publicly, news about the emergence of the group did leak earlier this year in The Financial Times \u2014 to the consternation of several participants.While the \u201cprinciples\u201d are only recommendations, Fidelity ended up pulling out of the consortium, as did Wellington, in part, because many of their funds have their own fiduciary requirements. \u201cEvery company has its own distinct business model, culture and values, and thus, we generally do not sign on to blanket industry documents,\u201d Fidelity said while praising the conversation as valuable.An article last Thursday about a secret meeting of corporate leaders to discuss the sorry state of publicly traded companies described incorrectly mandatory retirement ages that apply to some corporate boards. The requirements are established by corporations, not by the New York Stock Exchange.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Ends an Era for a Web Pioneer", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo was the front door to the web for an early generation of internet users, and its services still attract a billion visitors a month.But the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterday\u2019s great idea, and Yahoo has now reached the end of the line as an independent company.The board of the Silicon Valley company has agreed to sell Yahoo\u2019s core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.That compares with Yahoo\u2019s peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is not expected to join Verizon, but she is due to receive a severance payout worth about $57 million, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.Verizon and Yahoo declined to comment on the deal.Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.For a long time, the model worked. It seemed as if every company in America \u2014 and across much of the world \u2014 wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured into Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival required a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancies, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.Ms. Mayer, who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief executive four years ago but failed to halt its decline, was nevertheless rewarded handsomely for her efforts. Including the severance, she will have received cash and stock compensation worth about $218 million during her time at Yahoo, according to Equilar\u2019s calculations.Created by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo was originally a hand-selected directory to the nascent World Wide Web, but it quickly expanded its ambitions.\u201cYahoo is where you start,\u201d Jeff Mallett, the company\u2019s first chief operating officer, explained during a 1996 interview with a job candidate, Dan Finnigan. Mr. Finnigan, now the chief executive of Jobvite, said that he was skeptical of Yahoo\u2019s quest to dominate every category of content, but he later joined the company to run its HotJobs division.Google, which emerged a few years later, used a superior, more automated approach to indexing the web. Under its first chief executive, Timothy Koogle, Yahoo struck a four-year deal with Google in June 2000 to make Google\u2019s search engine the default on its website. Yahoo\u2019s leaders also tried to buy Google but eventually settled on building their own search tool.While Google was singularly focused on search, Yahoo recast itself as a content company under its second chief executive, Terry Semel, who succeeded Mr. Koogle in 2001.Yahoo then went through two more chief executives and two interim bosses in about three years, before hiring Ms. Mayer, a former Google search executive and tech celebrity, in July 2012.Despite her acclaim, Ms. Mayer failed to resolve Yahoo\u2019s central problem: a lack of focus.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The Alibaba offering put pressure on Ms. Mayer to come up with a plan to distribute that windfall to shareholders and prove that her turnaround plan was working.\u201cShe knew she was holding a melting ice cube in her hand. Rather than focus on slowing down the rate it was melting, she said, \u2018Let\u2019s look three, four, five years out,\u2019\u201d said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Company, who has followed the company for a decade.Mr. Finnigan, the former Yahoo executive, said that in hindsight, the company tried to compete in so many areas that it was difficult to succeed.\u201cYou have to be Coke or Pepsi. You don\u2019t want to be RC Cola. They let a lot of these verticals become RC Cola,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a sad day for those Yahoos who tried as hard as they did to create value.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In this case, he notes that so many of these favors seem to be based less on spiritual fulfillment or peace, and more on material gain.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGolgotha,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referring to the place where Christ was crucified, came about in the run-up to the 40th Anniversary of Chile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s United States-backed coup against Salvador Allende, its Marxist president. Mr. Toro-Goya wondered what could best represent the prisoner who had disappeared. The answer to him was pretty obvious: Jesus Christ.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was arrested for thinking in a different way than the Romans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was tortured, he died and then his body disappeared. That is what happened in so many cases of the disappeared in Chile.\u00e2\u0080\u009dUsing testimony from the era, he set about to create scenes, starting with story boards that are at first somewhat straightforward then progress to gruesome, unsettling images of brutality and sadism. Christ \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whom the faithful believe is God made man \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is subjected to humiliating, queasily disquieting brutality. In the Bible, he did this to bring salvation to humanity. In these carefully staged images, they bring an unnerving sadness and outrage. In essence, they are a latter-day version of the Stations of the Cross, which is why the series consists of 14 images.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted the Chilean community to share the pain of these people who were arrested, tortured, murdered and disappeared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Toro-Goya said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no pictures of this in my country. I wanted to leave a testimony on how could this have happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had been one of the last one walking from that time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Toro-Goya said.In some ways, the coup and its aftermath influenced Mr. Toro-Goya\u2019s style of working, doing ambrotypes rather than employing digital methods. After Allende\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overthrow, Chile became the place where neoliberal economic reforms were put into effect.  In 2005, Mr. Toro-Goya was out of work and unable to afford a full range of digital gear, computers and software \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which, of course, would have had to be updated regularly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe neoliberal model goes against my way of thinking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I opted for a way to do my work at home without having to depend on the photographic industry of computers and cameras.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It took him five years to master the technique of making his 8 by 10 images on glass plates. But he finds it fulfilling, working with a small team that helps him set up scenes and pose the actors, which he then photographs and hand-paints.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis country was the laboratory for the neoliberal economic model,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo  how do you confront that with a different way of thinking? One way I can show my political position is not just through my work, but how I do my work.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis other series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMilagreros,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a sardonic take on the intersection between materialism and spirituality, looking at what people pray for and the promises they make. Based on the ex voto paintings popular in Mexico and placed on home altars, he set about to recreate his own. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Latin America, we have such contradictions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything we ask from the saints has to do with the earthly, not the heavenly. We ask for a better car, to pay our mortgage. We do not ask for a spiritual gift. To me, that represents that absolute contradiction of faith in Latin America.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile his work offers a sharp critique of man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of religion, it also follows that tradition somewhat, in that he mediates in his own way between the ideas of God and man.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Mexico in particular, the person who does these ex votos are artists who are chosen because they are seen as having this divine mandate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only one who can communicate your desire to thank the saints is an artist. That is extraordinary to me: that it would be an artist, not a priest, as intermediary with the saints.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn artist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is remarkable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

He was an entrepreneur, a self-published author, a nutrition and fitness counselor, a proponent of the American gospel of self-improvement. He considered himself a lifestyle coach, even though he had failed in marriage, neglected to pay his taxes and was, at one point, living on $500 per month. He had also embarked on a spiritual quest to find his roots as a black man, traveling around Africa for two years.But Gavin Long\u2019s life also became a web of paranoid ideas, a professed allegiance to an antigovernment \u201csovereign citizen\u201d group and a belief that bloodshed was a better tool than peaceful protest in the fight against oppression.On Sunday, Mr. Long died in a parking lot just off a commercial street here in a shootout with the police. It was his 29th birthday. He killed three law enforcement officers and wounded three others. On Monday, law enforcement officials said Mr. Long had targeted officers, though his motives otherwise remained murky.Mr. Long had been a resident of Kansas City, Mo., and it is unclear what he was doing in Baton Rouge, though a video that appears to have been posted by him shows him in the Louisiana capital discussing the July 5 fatal police shooting of a fellow African-American man, Alton B. Sterling, here.Though the police here have released little information about Mr. Long, a deeper portrait is beginning to emerge, based on a large trail left online.And in one YouTube video, he discusses the killings of African-American men at the hands of police officers, including the death of Mr. Sterling, and advocates a bloody response instead of the protests that followed the deaths.\u201cOne hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,\u201d Mr. Long said, \u201chave been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. Zero have been successful just over simply protesting.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand on your rights, just like George Washington did, just like the other white rebels they celebrate and salute did,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what Nat Turner did. That\u2019s what Malcolm did.\u201dIn Baton Rouge on Monday, the crime scene along Airline Highway was returning to normal. Bullet holes could be seen in a wall of the Hair Crown Beauty Supply store, where the shooting took place. The city had begun the process of mourning the police officers Mr. Long gunned down \u2014 including Montrell Jackson, 32, an African-American and 10-year veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, who left behind a wife and son.On a podcast posted on iTunes and dated April, the speaker, who gives his name as Cosmo, gives a sketch of his life story. He says he grew up in Kansas City, and was a straight-A student until about middle school, when he became fat and started getting C\u2019s. As a child, he was something of a hustler who made extra money by making loans and charging interest.\u201cSay if I loaned out money to my family, even to my mother, I would make her pay me back, with interest,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I loaned $20, I would make you pay me back $5 on Friday.\u201dHe says he lost significant weight in high school, bought his first car at age 16 and joined the Marines.Mr. Long\u2019s military records show he served from 2005 to 2010, including a six-month deployment in Iraq. He was a sergeant and a data network specialist who earned several awards, including one for good conduct. He was also assigned to Okinawa, Japan, and several locations in Southern California.He attended Central Texas College at its Marine Corps Air Station Miramar site in San Diego and via distance education, earning an associate of arts degree.In 2011, court records show, he had an uncontested divorce from a woman named Aireyona Osha Hill. They listed that they had no children or assets and that Mr. Long earned $500 a month.But the man the teacher knew never spoke about violent solutions to the real world\u2019s problems.\u201cI\u2019m surprised he took it as far as he did,\u201d the teacher said Monday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me so much as he had an agenda against the government. He\u2019d always talk about how the government was corrupt.\u201dBy 2012, Mr. Long had moved \u2014 briefly, apparently \u2014 to Tuscaloosa, Ala., where he spent one semester at the University of Alabama. He majored in business. He made the dean\u2019s list. The University of Alabama police had no interactions with him during his time there. Mike Mansur, a spokesman for the Jackson County prosecutor\u2019s office, which covers most of Kansas City, said his office also had no record of contact with Mr. Long.He also attended Clark Atlanta University during the 2012-13 school year, and was in good academic standing, a university spokeswoman said. Although he claimed to be on the dean\u2019s list there, he said he had dropped out, sold his two cars, gave away his possessions and traveled to Africa.Mr. Long appeared to be obsessed with the idea of self-improvement, for himself and for others, and he embraced more esoteric means of achieving those goals.While traveling to Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, he said, he wrote three books, covering topics like \u201cholistic detoxification for health, well-being and success\u201d; the \u201cancient esoteric secrets of the Pineal Gland\u201d; and the \u201c124 Universal Laws and their use in the Laws of the Cosmos.\u201dThe group is largely African-American and subscribes to a \u201csovereign citizen\u201d ideology holding that members are \u201cno longer beholden to any form of government,\u201d said Ryan Lenz, a senior writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups.On Monday morning, a man who answered a phone number on the website and said he was a leader of the group, Fredrix Joe Washington, said he had never heard of Mr. Long.\u201cWe are about peace \u2014 and especially not about going out and killing some police officers,\u201d said Mr. Washington, 71.A minute-by-minute account of the shooting, with maps and video.This year, court records show, a case was filed against Mr. Long for not paying his local earnings tax. Papers in that case were served on his address last month, and his mother accepted them, according to court records. Six days later, the tax case was dismissed.In many of his podcasts, Mr. Long expounds at length on dating and self-improvement tips for men, arguing that they must display the characteristics of an \u201calpha\u201d male. But a number of his other online offerings discuss the historical oppression of minorities, and America\u2019s current racial problems. In a recent email he sent out to those interested in his ideas, he listed numerous instances of massacres of African-American people.\u201cI just want everyone to know that if anything may happen to me or with me, I am NOT affiliated with anybody, any group, nationality, association, religion, corporation, business, etc.\u201d the note said.\u201cHe pulled out a wad of money and said: \u2018You think this is something? This is nothing,\u2019\u201d she recalled. She said he had spoken of being in Africa and of being able to speak five languages. She was startled at his boldness and assertiveness. She had never seen him before and had no idea why he entered her shop that day.\u201cI could tell he wasn\u2019t right, his demeanor, his aggressiveness,\u201d she said.Still, Mr. Long made no mention of attacking police, she said.One of Mr. Long\u2019s last videos, posted to YouTube but taken down as of Monday, shows him driving around Baton Rouge. He approaches a number of African-Americans, strangers apparently, and doles out stray nuggets of advice and wisdom, deploying the salty language of the street. He refers to himself as a life coach, a freedom strategist, a real estate entrepreneur, an author, a teacher and a motivational speaker. And he tells them about his book.\u201cI want my people to succeed,\u201d he says at one point. Later, he refers to \u201cArabs\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d who do not care about people, ostensibly African-Americans, except when the latter give them their money. At one point he uses the word \u201ccracker,\u201d apparently in reference to whites. He also makes a passing reference to the shooting of Mr. Sterling.\u201cIt\u2019s two parts to freedom, bruh,\u201d he says. \u201cKnowing your rights and standing on your rights. They know we know our rights.\u201dBut how many black people, he asked, stand on their rights? \u201cAnd if you not standing on your rights then you have no rights.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Baton Rouge, Frances Robles from New York and John Eligon from Kansas City, Mo.

During ads, the hosts are often absorbed with their smartphones.Nearly a dozen Fox News employees, who work in front of and behind the camera, were granted anonymity to speak candidly about highly sensitive matters inside a network where privacy is still prized.The hosts\u2019 on-set interactions have improved slightly since last week\u2019s shows at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which were broadcast immediately after Mr. Ailes\u2019s departure.Still, employees say there is a continuing split inside the network, with one camp of old-guard Fox News loyalists \u2014 some of whom owe their careers to Mr. Ailes \u2014 upset at his ouster. Some are resentful toward Ms. Kelly for cooperating with lawyers brought in by the network\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, to investigate Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior. (About a dozen women have reported improper behavior by Mr. Ailes to investigators.)Another contingent inside Fox News is equally dismayed by the responses of stars like Kimberly Guilfoyle, Greta Van Susteren and Jeanine Pirro, who were quick to publicly defend Mr. Ailes after he was accused of harassment in a suit filed by the former anchor Gretchen Carlson.Mr. Hume, the anchor, wrote in an email on Wednesday that any reports of tension between himself and Ms. Kelly were exaggerated.\u201cYes, I am upset about Roger\u2019s departure. I love the guy,\u201d Mr. Hume wrote.\u201cI don\u2019t think this episode was about political correctness,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think Megyn Kelly did what she felt she had to do, and I am not upset with her.\u201dLooming over the Fox News operations is a battle for succession to Mr. Ailes, who over 20 years established his position as one of the most powerful in television. And dozens of the network\u2019s major stars and executives have been on the road for convention coverage since before Mr. Ailes resigned, forced to keep up from afar with career-changing developments at corporate headquarters in Manhattan.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this has been a challenging time,\u201d Rupert Murdoch, the network\u2019s new chairman and media mogul, who started Fox News with Mr. Ailes, wrote in a memo to the staff on Tuesday, in an attempt to bolster morale. Internally, Mr. Murdoch has signaled that he is in no rush to name a successor, and as acting chief executive he plans to be closely involved with the newsroom; the process for a replacement could take months, a person briefed on the plans said on Wednesday.In Philadelphia, an army of Fox workers has been clustered in a small warren of tents and trailers \u2014 known as the \u201cFox compound\u2019\u2019 \u2014 outside the Wells Fargo Center. Employees are commuting from a hotel in Mount Laurel, N.J., about 30 minutes away. The heavy humidity here and grueling schedule have left staff members fatigued as they wait for bursts of news about the network.But in a surprise, the network also announced that Hillary Clinton would be interviewed on the network on Sunday, her first postconvention television appearance and her first time on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in nearly five years. Chris Wallace, the anchor who once memorably clashed with her husband, President Bill Clinton, said he spent 15 months securing the interview.Bill Shine, a top Ailes lieutenant who is now considered a potential successor, is monitoring convention coverage from New York. Jay Wallace, the network\u2019s executive vice president of news and editorial, is overseeing operations in Philadelphia. (Mr. Shine and Mr. Wallace are running the network in partnership with Mr. Murdoch.)Mr. Clemente had been criticized within the network by rival executives, according to people who witnessed their discussions, but his departure took some employees by surprise: Fox had recently created a new office for Mr. Clemente in its Avenue of the Americas headquarters, converting a former conference room, one employee said.John Koblin, Sydney Ember and Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Suicide, a Security Guard for the Heart", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byModern LoveAfter my little sister died, I threw on the mantle of detective, signing up with an online dating service so I could read the profile she had posted. But all I learned is that we shared the same favorite flavor of ice cream.So I scrutinized old photos, searching her face for clues. But she looked as she always had. Whatever she had been thinking when the shutter clicked, I wasn\u2019t about to learn now.On a crisp January night, Stephanie had jumped from the 27th story of the office building where she worked. I was eight and a half months pregnant at the time and living hundreds of miles away, meaning travel could be risky, even more so with the emotional toll. So I missed the drive my parents made to the coroner\u2019s office from her dentist with X-rays needed to identify her. I missed the cremation.Her death at 30 didn\u2019t feel real, and so part of me decided it wasn\u2019t. And part of me must have believed that solving the mystery \u2014 Who was she, really? \u2014 might bring her back. I pushed aside an obvious incentive: It was easier for me to probe the facts of the past than to live in the emotions of the present, where I risked being crushed by grief, regret and guilt.Seventeen months in, I visited the high-rise where she died. Two of my sister\u2019s colleagues met me outside the revolving doors. We hugged, a group of three leaning quietly into one another.\u201cWhere did she land?\u201d I asked. An awful question, but I needed to know.They pointed without hesitation in two different directions, then stared helplessly at each other. It had been in the middle of the night, they conceded. One waved toward an outdoor alcove, saying, \u201cThe managing partner left flowers over there.\u201dI sat and touched the smooth surface as bewildered lawyers, executives and secretaries swerved around me. It was June and sunny. The ground yielded no clues.I snapped photos on my phone, pointing down, pointing up and backing away to record a panoramic view. Peering inside at the security desk, where a uniformed body sat, I wondered: Who had found her? A guard? What might he know?Seven months later, as the second anniversary of her death slipped by, I searched online for my sister\u2019s name yet again, despite already knowing what I would find: her obituary from the local paper, an article mentioning her in a law magazine, reviews of professors from her time as a graduate student in art history.But this time there was something new, a blog I had never seen, white words on a gray background, pages and pages overflowing with the trauma-laced account of an unwilling witness.On that fateful night, this woman had nodded hello as my sister swiped her access card a little after 1:30 a.m. Eleven minutes later, she glimpsed the last moment of Steph\u2019s life through the lobby\u2019s giant plate-glass windows. She had run out into the wintry cold, shooing away stunned bystanders.The security guard had brown hair past her shoulders and was about my age. She had included my sister\u2019s full name in her most recent entry. Up it popped in my search.Abruptly, I painted over my mental image of a reticent older man with a beard. Instead, here was a woman, a peer, whose eloquence and pain took my breath away. We were each surveying the same tragedy from wildly different perspectives. To my surprise, she cataloged emotions that huddled inside me too: the aloneness, the sense of being cast in an endlessly looping horror movie, the disconnect from a world where things like this didn\u2019t happen.But the posts also offered a gripping promise: information. The security guard carried a narrative about my sister that until now had been inaccessible to me. Here was an avenue, finally, that might help me to understand.I found the guard on Facebook and composed a message. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much it meant to hear your story,\u201d I wrote, my heart thudding inside my rib cage. \u201cMaybe by connecting with each other we can both find a little peace.\u201d I shared my email address.Her reply came within the hour: \u201cTo say that I was relieved to receive your message is an understatement. For the past two years I\u2019ve wanted to reach out to you/your family but was never brave enough. I\u2019m fairly certain my writing Stephanie\u2019s full name was a not-so-subconscious attempt at reaching out to you, in hopes you\u2019d reach back.\u201dWe began a frenzied correspondence. Too shy to ask questions at first, I offered the information she desperately sought, stories that would breathe life into my sister and shift the focus away from the horror of what the guard had witnessed.Over several emails, the memories came tumbling out. How Steph played the piano and cello and had an operalike singing voice. How she loved to bake muffins for me to eat. How we once drove to a chocolate festival only to realize we\u2019d come a day late, which made us laugh and laugh as we sat together in the car.For two years, friends had encouraged me to share my happy memories. Every time, my throat swelled shut. With this security guard, though, I found my voice. It was, if not easy, then somehow right. I doubted everything I thought I had known about my sister, but as our emails flew back and forth, I realized I was certain of this: Steph wouldn\u2019t have wanted the security guard, posted in the wrong place at the wrong time, to live a shattered life because of her final act.Several days in, I haltingly asked for what I had imagined since finding the blog \u2014 a firsthand account of what had happened that night. \u201cIt feels like part of her story, the end of her life, and I want to understand it as best I can,\u201d I wrote, ashamed of my longing. \u201cI vividly remember the day she was born and going to visit her in the hospital (I was 5). I guess I want to know the story of her death too.\u201dAs with everything, she understood. We had the opposite problem: She knew the death. I knew the life. Now we could fuse our respective halves.Choosing her words carefully, she chronicled my sister\u2019s death, cautioning that real life is far more ghastly than in the movies. \u201cWhile I do want to help, I don\u2019t want to go so far to the other side that I\u2019m not helping at all,\u201d she wrote. Her message arrived as I stood on a subway platform in Washington, D.C.I read it in snatches, my brain jamming. \u201cThis really happened,\u201d I thought. \u201cShe really did this. She\u2019s really gone.\u201d The train swayed while I hung on.Even as tears dripped onto my jacket, I felt oddly relieved. Dwelling in the present, which I had fought for so long, was turning out to be survivable. And at first that was largely thanks to the security guard who had carted me there.I hoped she would recover someday even while I doubted I ever would. Still, we had guided each other through smothering blackness, supplying pinpricks of light only the other could.And now we found we could say anything. She became a potent cheerleader, urging me forward and supporting me when, on the fourth anniversary of my sister\u2019s death this year, I chose self-care over suffering for the first time. I told her I\u2019d bought myself a purple jacket in honor of the lost young woman who loved to shop.\u201cI can only assume there\u2019s an unfair amount of guilt that you shouldn\u2019t live with but probably do, so loving yourself and honoring her is healthy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNext year will be shoes and then makeup. I know zip about makeup so you\u2019re on your own haha.\u201dWe began signing our emails \u201cxo\u201d and \u201cmuch love.\u201d We meant it.Eight months after finding each other online, we met in person for the first time outside the office building where she still worked. A chilly wind blew. Not yet on duty, she wore a fuchsia tank top and assured me she wasn\u2019t cold.I saw tattoos peeking out from under the fabric. We walked a block to a coffee shop: hot tea for her, and hot chocolate for me. She told me about her family and how she had nurtured a passion for knitting during overnight shifts.Back at the gray-and-glass behemoth whose contours I tried to memorize with each visit, she pointed to the spot my sister\u2019s colleagues could only guess at. I sat, this time in the right place, kissed my hand and pressed it gently to the ground.Absence was in the air, but presence too. My security guard lingered nearby. She had promised she would be there as long as I needed her, that she would safeguard our unusual bond always.Hugging her goodbye, I pledged the same.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minnesota Police Officer\u2019s \u2018Bulletproof Warrior\u2019 Training Is Questioned", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byST. PAUL \u2014 The Minnesota police officer who fatally shot an African-American man during a traffic stop last week had recently undergone specialized training that critics say can lead officers to believe they are under constant threat of being harmed and can intensify encounters with civilians.The officer, Jeronimo Yanez, of the Police Department in St. Anthony, Minn., shot and killed Philando Castile after a traffic stop in nearby Falcon Heights, Minn., on July 6. The shooting is being investigated by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The Justice Department has said it is monitoring the case.Policing tactics have been under heightened scrutiny since the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, in August 2014. The police officer in that encounter was not indicted but the department was sharply criticized for its tactics in a report by the Justice Department.Since then, many police departments across the country, with encouragement from the Justice Department, have opted for what they refer to as a guardian mentality, in which de-escalation of potentially violent situations and similar techniques are emphasized.Some departments, however, believe that a more traditional and aggressive so-called warrior approach is necessary.Officer Yanez underwent a two-day training course called \u201cThe Bulletproof Warrior\u201d in May 2014, according to records from the City of St. Anthony, a suburb near St. Paul. The training combined the two approaches.Mr. Glennon said in an interview that the main focus of the course was to teach police officers to maintain a sense of flexibility in their work, which he calls \u201cbalance,\u201d and involves when to use force and at what level, given the circumstances. He said the course did not teach officers to have a warrior mentality.\u201cThere\u2019s no cookie-cutter approach to this \u2014 that\u2019s what we teach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tell them that they have a three to four times greater chance of dropping dead from a heart attack than from being shot by a felon with a gun.\u201dAsked about the guardian and warrior approaches, Mr. Glennon said, \u201cIf anyone says they are mutually exclusive, that\u2019s nuts.\u201dBut critics of the seminars say that the training offered, which includes watching videos showing officers being shot, runs counter to the reforms departments must adopt if they are to win back trust, especially of black residents.\u201cCourses like this reinforce the thinking that everyone is out to get police officers,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a research and policy organization based in Washington. \u201cThis teaches officers, \u2018If you hesitate, you could lose your life.\u2019 It is the exact opposite of the way many police chiefs are going.\u201dThe \u201cBulletproof Warrior\u201d booklet handed out at the company\u2019s seminars addresses warfare as much as police work. A copy of the booklet was obtained by The New York Times. It has charts and graphs on \u201cCombat Efficiency\u201d and \u201cPerceptual Distortions in Combat.\u201dThe booklet portrays a world of constant and increased threat to officers, despite more than two decades of declining violent crime in the United States, and the fact that the last few years have been among the safest to be an American police officer.One section is titled \u201cPre-attack Indicators.\u201d It says, \u201cUnfortunately, the will to survive is all too often trained out of the psyches of our police officers,\u201d and warns of \u201cpredators\u201d and \u201cadversaries\u201d who are younger than officers and who have \u201cbeen in more gunfights and violent encounters.\u201d It advises: \u201cAn attack on you is a violent act! What is the only way to overcome that violence?\u201dMr. Glennon said the videos of police officers being shot \u201cin the blink of an eye,\u201d are interrupted frequently for analysis, and are limited to about one hour of the 12-hour training seminar.\u201cIf I sit down a bunch of kids showing hours of cops getting killed during traffic stops, they\u2019re going to think they\u2019re going to get killed during a traffic stop,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t do that. We talk about it.\u201d One portion of the course shows officers acting improperly and another part discusses how better to handle stress, he said.\u201cI wished we had called the class \u2018Balance,\u2019\u201d he said.The seminar\u2019s booklet offers ways to determine if someone is lying, based on factors like eye contact, blinking, posture and the use of certain phrases.Another booklet distributed at seminars, \u201cAnatomy of Force Incidents,\u201d repeatedly makes the point that officers are allowed to \u2014 and need to \u2014 use more force than they may believe, and to use it pre-emptively. \u201cMyth: The officer must use the minimal amount of force necessary to affect their lawful law enforcement objectives,\u201d it says, and \u201cMyth: An officer must use the \u2018least intrusive\u2019 or \u2018best\u2019 option when using force.\u201dThe fatal shooting of Mr. Castile captured widespread attention because Diamond Reynolds, Mr. Castile\u2019s girlfriend, streamed its aftermath on Facebook Live, calmly narrating what had happened and panning her camera phone to show Mr. Castile slumped in the driver\u2019s seat, his white T-shirt soaked with blood.The shooting came during a week in which another African-American man, Alton Sterling, was fatally shot by a police officer in Baton Rouge, La., and five Dallas police officers were killed during an ambush by an African-American Army veteran who told the police that he was seeking revenge for the earlier shootings.The deaths laid bare the gap in perceptions between some whites and some African-Americans when it comes to the fairness and quality of policing in local departments across the nation, with some African-Americans having long complained about police brutality, including unnecessary shootings by some of the police.Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a contributed reporting from New York and Matt Apuzzo from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley of Space Start-Ups? It Could Be Seattle", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside an office in this city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby.There\u2019s more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle\u2019s abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.\u201cThe reason for it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don\u2019t seem to want to move to L.A.\u201d\u201cAbandoned in Place,\u201d a new book of photographs by Roland Miller, finds haunting beauty in derelict launch pads, rusting towers and other detritus of the American space race.One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun\u2019s energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won\u2019t say how much they\u2019ve invested.\u201cMany of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,\u201d said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s director of marketing and business development.Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in which Boeing is based. It is Chicago, not Seattle. (Though the company moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001, about half of its workforce is still in Seattle.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Is Said to Collect Final Bids as Auction Nears Its End", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The gavel is finally poised to drop in the drawn-out auction for Yahoo\u2019s core internet business.Final bids for the services, which include Yahoo\u2019s search, email, advertising and media operations, are due Monday, with the board set to make a decision soon afterward, according to people briefed on the process who asked for anonymity because the bidding was confidential.The sale of Yahoo\u2019s business would close out a largely unsuccessful four-year effort by Marissa Mayer, the company\u2019s chief executive, to turn around the internet company. Although Yahoo was once the place where many web users began their wanderings, it fell on hard times over the last decade through a series of strategic and managerial missteps. Although Yahoo\u2019s properties still draw more than one billion visitors a month, the company accounts for a tiny slice of the time people spend online.The bidders for Yahoo\u2019s operations include the telecommunications giants Verizon Communications and AT&T, several private equity firms and a Quicken Loans co-founder, Dan Gilbert, who is getting financial backing from Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.The offers are expected to vary depending on what assets are included, but Wall Street expects the business to fetch as much as $6 billion, including intellectual property and land.Though several bidders have acknowledged running into what one called \u201chairy\u201d issues, nothing has emerged as a deal breaker. People involved in the auction describe it as competitive.Any sale of Yahoo has been slowed by a trickle of unpleasant revelations to bidders about expensive decisions made by Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was named Yahoo\u2019s chief in July 2012.The biggest surprise: In late June, Yahoo told bidders that they could be on the hook for more than $1 billion in immediate payments to Mozilla, the company that makes the Firefox web browser.In a 2014 deal, Yahoo promised to pay Mozilla at least $375 million a year to make Yahoo the default search engine on Firefox \u2014 about $100 million a year more than Alphabet\u2019s Google unit was then paying for similar prominence, according to Yahoo and Mozilla filings.To sweeten the deal, Ms. Mayer personally negotiated a provision that gave Mozilla unusual leverage to demand all of remaining payments upfront if Yahoo were sold, according to people briefed on the terms of the contract.To demand the payout, Mozilla would have to show that the change in ownership was hurting the Mozilla brand and degrading the search experience, according to one of the people briefed on the terms. If Mozilla switched to another search provider instead, Yahoo would only have to make up the difference between its $375 million annual guarantee and the fee paid by Mozilla\u2019s new partner.The deal\u2019s provisions put pressure on any winning bidder to continue Ms. Mayer\u2019s heavy investments in search, which she has championed despite the long odds of success against Google. About 42 percent of Yahoo\u2019s $5 billion in revenue last year came from search.Yahoo decided the contract\u2019s provisions were not significant enough to disclose to shareholders, despite a series of letters last year from the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the company to lay out the terms of the agreement and the risks to Yahoo. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the dispute.A Yahoo spokeswoman, Rebecca Neufeld, declined to comment on the Mozilla contract or the broader sale process.Denelle Dixon-Thayer, the chief legal and business officer of Mozilla, said she could not discuss specific terms of the Yahoo contract because of a confidentiality clause, but she acknowledged that Mozilla had protected itself from \u201cdownside risk.\u201dMs. Dixon-Thayer said that when Mozilla switched to Yahoo from Google in 2014, its priority was making sure there was viable competition in search.\u201cThe most important thing to us is a focus on search, a focus on improving and building a search product that we can all be proud of,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to and want to see more innovation in search.\u201dBidders are also trying to determine how much they would have to pay out in severance if they cut staff. As of March 31, Yahoo had 9,400 employees, excluding those already scheduled to be laid off this year.Ms. Mayer and the board have handed out hefty stock awards to keep Yahoo employees from jumping ship over the last year and a half as the company has repeatedly shifted strategies.As of March 31, Yahoo had 35.5 million unvested restricted stock units outstanding. At the company\u2019s current stock price, those have a value of more than $1.3 billion. The company also had 5.4 million stock options outstanding.Yahoo\u2019s top four executives alone, including Ms. Mayer, would collectively receive about $100 million, including two years of stock awards, if they were fired. Rank-and-file employees would get their next six months of stock awards accelerated, and middle managers would get 12 months to 18 months.Brian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, estimates that Yahoo\u2019s operating business is worth $3.5 billion, but he said that whatever the final price, the sale would have little impact on Yahoo\u2019s stock price, which has already risen this year on speculation of a deal.\u201cInvestors just don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.Once any deal is announced, investors will turn their attention to the biggest issue affecting the stock: How will the remaining stub of Yahoo make money from its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company with a face value of $31 billion, and its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, worth about $9 billion? That process, fraught with complex tax and legal issues, could itself take many months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Sponsored Content Is Becoming King in a Facebook World", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byFor some publishers unsettled by a fast-changing online advertising business, sponsored content has provided much-needed relief.In recent years, publications large and small have invested in teams to make sponsored content \u2014 written stories, videos or podcasts that look and feel like journalistic content \u2014 hoping to make up for declines in conventional advertising. To varying degrees, they have succeeded.Younger companies like Vice and BuzzFeed have built whole businesses around the concept. The Atlantic expects three-quarters of its digital ad revenue to come from sponsored content this year. Slate, the web publisher, says that about half of its ad revenue comes from native ads, as sponsored content is also called, and the other half from traditional banner or display ads. Many major newspapers, including The New York Times, have declared sponsored content to be an important part of their strategies.But as the relationship between publishers and social platforms like Facebook grows closer \u2014 and as more straightforward forms of advertising are devalued by ad-blocking and industry automation, the role, and definition, of sponsored content has shifted. Now, publishers, social media companies and advertisers are negotiating new relationships.Audiences have migrated away from news websites and toward Facebook and other social media destinations, which for a competitive price can provide advertisers access to larger and more finely targeted groups of people, challenging the value of a publisher\u2019s own channels. With a weaker claim over audiences, publishers have been left to compete for advertising on different terms, leaning less on the size or demographics of their readerships, and more on the sorts of campaigns they can engineer for advertisers \u2014 campaigns that are then used across the internet.\u201cThe differences between five years ago and now, in client expectations, are enormous,\u201d said Keith Hernandez, the president of Slate.The resulting arrangements are more client-agency than advertiser-publisher, and advertisers are looking to media companies for a full range of services, from the production of campaigns to the often paid-for placement of the content across the internet and social media.As it has for traditional editorial content, Facebook has become a primary distributor for many publications\u2019 sponsored posts, even though outside sponsored content was not officially permitted until April, when the social network published formal guidelines.Facebook\u2019s welcome of sponsored posts was broadly seen as a promising and necessary development. But some publishers were troubled by the manner in which Facebook said it would display sponsored posts and by how much power it put in the hands of advertisers.Under Facebook\u2019s system, all advertisers must be disclosed and displayed as co-authors under the post or video, a level of disclosure that is required by the Federal Trade Commission.In addition, these advertisers are now privy to a wide range of information about their sponsored content posted on Facebook \u2014 something that once was visible only to the publisher. They also get a deeper and more profound layer of data: They can see how much money was spent on Facebook promotion to drive traffic to the post in order to meet targets, a common and sometimes lucrative practice for publishers, who have been able to significantly mark up the price on such distribution.What\u2019s more, Facebook invites the advertiser to pay to promote their sponsored content on their own, making them less reliant on the publisher for distribution.From Facebook\u2019s point of view, this transparency eliminates inefficiency \u2014 why let middlemen charge extra for an audience that Facebook is selling? But for publishers who sold advertisers on their ability not just to create posts but to make sure they are seen, either through clever promotion or paid placement, such visibility can be deflating.This change poses a persistent and tantalizing question to increasingly savvy advertisers: Could we just attract eyes to our posts ourselves? And if not now, maybe soon?The change also discourages any illusions about how easy it could be for publishers to make money from native advertising. Sponsored content \u2014 which, in 2016, often means video \u2014 is expensive to produce and difficult to do well. Controlling distribution, albeit through Facebook, was for some a more profitable lever, and a way to pad deals that, while often growing in size, offered thin margins.This is, of course, a boon to advertisers. \u201cMany native campaigns are quite expensive, and if you limit the work you\u2019re doing to the creation of content, and leave the distribution to the brand, then it can become more affordable,\u201d said Stephanie Losee, head of content for Visa.With less ability to charge for distribution, on their own channels or others, and a growing dependence on margin-squeezing outside platforms, publishers may be left to compete with creative agencies on their turf. Publishers becoming ad agencies, in other words, means competing not just with one another, but with the agencies that already exist.In this nascent new order, competitors are defined largely by their limitations. While the terms and prices that publishers can accept from advertisers are set by the need to support a connected news or entertainment organization \u2014 the reason they chose this controversial path in the first place \u2014 conventional agencies are hampered by a dependence on lucrative TV work, from which they are accustomed to low volumes and high margins. Accordingly, publishers\u2019 pitches often focus on price: their ability to create more content for less.Such a situation, in which publishers join a broader competition for advertising production dollars, would be a testament to how much and how quickly media distribution has changed. Publishers may get back in the running for advertising deals lost in recent years, but much like the editorial content they produce, their ads will succeed or fail in contexts over which they have less and less control.Bryan Goldberg, founder of the women\u2019s website Bustle, views these changes with optimism, at least as far as they affect larger publishers. \u201cGross margins have slightly decreased, but not anywhere near enough to offset the upward movement in scale,\u201d he said.For smaller publishers, or those without backing from venture capital, the situation is less heartening. \u201cRunning a full-scale sales, marketing and operations team requires tens of millions of dollars of annual expenses,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said.Facebook, for its part, has provided a preview of how such a system might mature. A program that the company calls Anthology is meant to help video publishers \u201clend brands their creativity, storytelling expertise and video production know-how.\u201d It is being used by companies like Vox Media and Vice with advertising clients to produce videos that will then be promoted on Facebook.Started last year, and quietly expanding to include more publishers, Anthology offers hints at what a platform marketplace managed from the top down might look like. It is tightly controlled, with a clear division of labor: The advertiser pays; the publisher creates; Facebook promotes. (Snapchat recently introduced a similar program, matching clients with a mix of publishers and ad agencies for campaigns.)For now, despite uncertainty, publishers will most likely keep pushing forward. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of past the point of turning back. You kind of have to see if it can work,\u201d said Joe Lazauskas, editor of Contently, a content marketing and editorial firm. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of alternatives.\u201dMs. Losee, who previously ran the sponsored content operation for Politico, the politics news website, suggested that publishers\u2019 half-decade push into online native advertising will ultimately help them, but only up to a point.\u201cSponsored content can\u2019t replace the revenue from traditional advertising,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the future business model for publishers, in this disintermediation of the media era, is a work in progress.\u201dAn article on Monday about publishers\u2019 increasing use of sponsored content to raise advertising revenue misstated how much of The Atlantic\u2019s advertising revenue comes from sponsored content. It is three-quarters of digital ad revenue, not of ad revenue over all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Live Videos, Small Screens: Campaigns Hope Voters Like What They See", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byThe show, which will be available on smartphones and tablets without interruption, will also feature celebrity guest commentators analyzing Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech. Though it may resemble standard political fare, the new media start-up responsible for the program \u2014 Studio 2016 \u2014 is an in-house production unit run by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.The creation of a team to produce original content that resembles news coverage is the latest attempt by a presidential candidate to bypass major news networks and speak directly to voters. By harnessing social media platforms to distribute hours of live video to hundreds of millions of potential followers, the Clinton campaign is poised to deliver a convention message more fully under its control.\u201cEverything we do for the convention, this four-day sprint, is about trying to bring people in, trying to engage people, trying to speak directly to them,\u201d said Teddy Goff, the campaign\u2019s chief digital strategist.Advances in technology, especially in live, high-definition streaming video, have allowed campaigns to reach people who may not be tuning in to network coverage. Just four years ago, social networks like Twitter and Facebook offered what digital specialists called a \u201csecond-screen experience.\u201d Watching a convention speech typically required a standard television set, and apps on smartphones or computers were mostly used to react on social networks.Now, viewers \u2014 and not just young ones \u2014 can ditch the television entirely and watch the convention on a smaller, portable screen. That provides an opportunity that political campaigns are seizing to connect directly with voters without having to suffer through analysis and criticism from journalists and pundits.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cPart of what you want to do is shape the conversation that\u2019s happening, and you want to give tools to your supporters to spread the message,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama who used similar approaches while he was in the White House.\u201cYou want to expose it to as many people as possible, either in the moment or afterward, with context that you provide,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said.Republicans, too, have seized on live video as a tool for shaping their message. In Cleveland, the Republicans offered all of the convention speeches over the major social media networks. Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign organized live video from backstage, some of it delivered on Snapchat and other social networks.\u201cLess and less people are watching live television,\u201d said Sam Osborne, the digital director for the Republican National Convention. Politicians who do not use live video delivered on phones and tablets, he said, \u201cwill not get your message out to the people that you need to reach.\u201dThe idea for the Democrats\u2019 show built off a one-hour show that they produced at the convention four years ago, hosted by the actor Kal Penn of the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d movies. Laura Olin, a Democratic digital strategist, said the video show was cutting-edge at the time. This year, instead of just one hour of programming, there will be four days of content.\u201cIt will be at a level that we have never seen before,\u201d Ms. Olin said.The difference largely has to do with vast advances in technology, networks and social media apps. Facebook and Twitter have overhauled their apps to focus on live video, and other companies that focus on using video, like Snapchat, have emerged in recent years.Facebook introduced Facebook Live this year, and has partnered with campaigns and news media organizations to produce content. For the conventions, the company is using the live-streams of news outlets and the parties held during the events as a way of bringing the programming of the conventions to users\u2019 screens.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that often people are tweeting as they watch something on TV, so the hope is this is one experience,\u201d said Nick Pacilio, a Twitter spokesman.The presidential campaigns have fully embraced digital media as a central part of their messaging and organizing strategy. In June, at a senior-level planning meeting at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn, members of the digital team almost jokingly proposed an online contest to select a constituent to have a role at the Democratic convention. The campaign\u2019s top strategists immediately agreed.The campaign has also invited celebrity supporters to use social media as an organizing tool in a nationwide effort to register three million voters. And Mr. Goff said the campaign was using its digital media presence to bolster its collection of email addresses and other valuable information about voters.Smartphones, and the extensive use of social media by campaigns to communicate directly with voters, often provide a view into places that previously would have gone unseen because of limited access of the news media, especially at conventions. Instagram\u2019s Backstage Portrait Studio at both conventions captures the final moments before a speaker, or eventually the candidate, takes the stage.And Snapchat has proved unusually adept at gaining behind-the-scenes access at closed-door events like fund-raisers. Delegates, campaign aides and convention officials used the platform at the Republican convention, and the company expects the same among Democrats in Philadelphia.For those who attend the conventions in person, the most prominent social media platforms have been at least as visible as the broadcast television and cable networks.The bright royal blue hue of Facebook dominated large spaces in the convention hall and news media filing centers, providing coffee, snacks and real-time data for journalists and, for delegates and convention attendees, hands-on trials of the company\u2019s virtual reality product Oculus. Facebook also built a studio adjacent to the arena to allow its news partners, including The New York Times, to produce live segments.Twitter has booths scattered around the convention site, but is also focusing offsite. As it did last week in Cleveland, the company is renting out restaurants and event spaces to host meetings and panel discussions on the platform\u2019s role in the election, with topics like #BlackTwitter and women in politics.But for the Clinton campaign, the goal of these efforts is to reach an audience well beyond Philadelphia.A campaign spokesman said that what he called \u201cgavel-to-gavel coverage\u201d of the convention would be distributed to viewers on Apple TV, Amazon Fire and Roku, in addition to Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.Mr. Goff said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategists were not ignoring the traditional broadcast and cable networks. But he noted that 2014 was the first year that Americans, in aggregate, had spent more time in front of their smartphone screens than they did in front of their television screens.\u201cTV is still really important,\u201d Mr. Goff said. \u201cBut things are changing really quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Verizon and Yahoo: Internet Also-Rans With Big Hopes", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsVerizon is continuing to invest in ancient web history. The telecom company on Monday said it was paying $4.8 billion to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business. It effectively justifies rival T-Mobile\u2019s tongue-in-cheek claim earlier this year that Verizon is having a midlife crisis. The Verizon boss, Lowell McAdam, after all, is betting the deal will help attract digital advertisers by meshing the internet-search firm with AOL, another 1990s highflier that Verizon bought last year.It is an appealing idea. Yahoo brings with it not just its search and advertising units, but also content like sports and finance that could play well with AOL\u2019s assets like The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. Verizon will also get its hands on Yahoo\u2019s 600 million monthly mobile users.Yahoo shareholders, though, have an exceptionally gloomy view of the business. It does not help that the division\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, is likely to be just $770 million this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from $2 billion a decade ago. But investors do not even reckon the units being sold are worth anything. The overall company has around $5 billion in net cash and owns stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that are worth some $41 billion, yet Yahoo\u2019s market value is just $37 billion.Mr. McAdam\u2019s vision ought to resonate on Madison Avenue. Advertising executives are nervous about the twin powers of Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which are expected to account for more than half of the American digital advertising revenue this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.They have shown little inclination to send more business to either of Verizon\u2019s dot-com 1.0 duo. Yahoo and AOL\u2019s collective slice of the $69 billion digital-ad market is expected to be 5.2 percent this year, eMarketer forecasts, and is likely to decrease to 4.8 percent in 2017.That has allowed Google and Facebook to gobble up most of the digital-advertising market. It may be that Tim Armstrong, who will run the combined AOL-Yahoo business, has a great plan to turn these two internet also-rans into a formidable force.

{"Headline": "When Friends Buy a Home Together", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byFor some New Yorkers who have been priced out of New York City\u2019s real estate game, pooling resources with friends and siblings has become the quickest path to homeownership. And while sharing a front door can put even the best relationships to the test, some are finding it\u2019s worth the risk.For Laurie Savage, a writer and restaurant server, and her husband, Garette Henson, a filmmaker, both 36, the arrival of their son, Fox Henson, almost 2, sparked the idea of buying real estate with a friend. That friend was Alix Frey, 37, whom they had met when they were all students at Sarah Lawrence College.For assistance in their search for a place to buy, the three, who had rented apartments in the same brownstone in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for eight years, turned to Marina T. Schindler, a saleswoman at Compass real estate and one of Ms. Frey\u2019s close friends.\u201cIt\u2019s a really good way for people to work the system,\u201d Ms. Schindler said. \u201cNot everybody has that money for a down payment. They realize if they team up, they get more bang for the buck.\u201dIt\u2019s a complicated process, she added, \u201cbecause they\u2019ve got to have an agreement between each other, they have to trust each other, but it\u2019s a great way for young families to make a bigger, better investment.\u201dThe friends had originally looked at properties separately, almost immediately concluding that they were priced out of Fort Greene. As they expanded their searches to Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant, the numbers still seemed shocking. \u201cAlix was looking at a one-bedroom for $750,000. She wanted a two-bedroom for less than that,\u201d Ms. Savage said.\u201cWe realized we can get a better space if we buy together,\u201d she said. \u201cThe apartments priced at what we\u2019re each getting our units for were like tiny boxes. It was startling, the difference in the quality of what we could get. So very quickly we said we\u2019re open to it.\u201dShe declined to say what the three ultimately paid, but the median price for two-family houses in the Bed-Stuy area is about $935,000, according to the appraiser Jonathan J. Miller.The most difficult part was getting a mortgage together, which required the friends to be totally open about their finances. They have a single mortgage, with the payments based on the percentage of property owned. The Savage/Henson living space is bigger than Ms. Frey\u2019s, so the couple pay a bigger share.\u201cFor us, it was about getting comfortable with that transparency,\u201d Ms. Savage said.Having already lived in the same building made the prospect of buying together almost a matter of course. Ms. Savage said she feels a sense of pride that they were able to pull off homeownership.\u201cPeople have asked me if it\u2019s less exciting because you\u2019re sharing with someone,\u201d Ms. Savage said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite the opposite. No one expects anyone to want to share; that\u2019s not the way our society is built. We feel really proud of what we did in finding a way to make it happen.\u201dOver in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, a pair of enterprising siblings and their families had the same idea when it came to finding new digs.Mr. Blyer and Ms. Pezzulli, the director of development at the Lower Eastside Girls Club, have a daughter, Eva Newman, 9, from Ms. Pezzulli\u2019s previous relationship, and a son, Noah Blyer, 9 months. Ms. Blyer and Mr. Cornier have three children \u2014 Chloe Cornier, 8, from Mr. Cornier\u2019s previous relationship, Rumi Cornier, almost 3, and Shai Cornier, 8 months.\u201cWe\u2019ve been very open and communicative about things,\u201d Mr. Blyer said. \u201cAt the end of the day we don\u2019t want to ruin our relationship with each other.\u201dThe two families looked for property independently but quickly realized that if they could agree on a neighborhood, they\u2019d get more for their money by going in together. In their chosen Flatbush, Mr. Miller said, the median price for a two-family house is $562,000.\u201cIt made sense to do it together \u2014 to have one contractor, one set of plans,\u201d Mr. Blyer said. \u201cIt seemed a lot simpler than dividing our family resources to do it.\u201dMisha Chiporukha, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate, helped the Blyer siblings and their partners find their home. \u201cBuying together was the best option that they had,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past year, I\u2019ve met several buyers who were not able to afford a townhouse on their own, but with friends and family, it becomes possible. Plus, you get more square footage, family gatherings are easier, and with sharing child care expenses, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dThe couples plan to convert the property into two condos. Mr. Blyer and his family will have the top two floors, while his sister and her family take the bottom two, including the backyard. They will live by certain boundaries. As Mr. Blyer pointed out: \u201cOf course, she says, \u2018You can use it anytime you want,\u2019 but I\u2019m not just going to walk through her house at any given moment that I want to get a suntan.\u201dFinances will also be handled formally \u2014 a joint bank account has already been set up to handle the upkeep of the house. But more than just a sound financial decision, living in the same home will provide a sense of community for the two families.\u201cOur son is going to have these cousins that are going to grow up kind of like brothers \u2014 that\u2019s really special to me,\u201d Mr. Blyer said.New York City isn\u2019t the only place where friends and relatives have realized the advantages of banding together.In January, Marc Aschoff, 25, a financial adviser in New York who lives in Hoboken, N.J., and three childhood friends from the Jersey Shore threw their money in a pot and paid $240,000 for a single-family fixer-upper in Springfield, N.J.\u201cWe were looking for a place to purchase to live together,\u201d Mr. Aschoff said. \u201cOur thinking was, find a place, live there for a year or two, fix it up and resell it for a profit.\u201dMr. Aschoff\u2019s partners in homeownership are Michael Carbonara, 26, an electrical engineer who lives outside Philadelphia; Michael Zonin, 25, a staff engineer at Langan Engineering in New York; and Chris Sorrentino, 25, a Realtor at Keller Williams City Life in Hoboken.The men had some previous experience as property owners, having purchased three houses over two years near Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and rented them out to students. When they embarked upon that venture, it seemed that everyone was skeptical of the idea.\u201cAt that point, most of us were living with our parents,\u201d Mr. Aschoff said.Mr. Carbonara said: \u201cWe bought the first one and everyone was on edge. Then we bought the second one and we were addicted. My mom was like, \u2018This kid\u2019s for real.\u2019 \u201dEven so, their stint as landlords may not have prepared them for the Springfield house, which is in need of a great deal of work, much of which they are undertaking themselves. They have argued about money spent and time dedicated to working on the house. And they have encountered the odd renovation surprise, such as a new stairwell installed too close to the front door.\u201cWe started ripping down all the plaster, and we could see there were things wrong internally,\u201d Mr. Aschoff said. \u201cNow we\u2019re down to the frame of the house. We didn\u2019t want to get this deep.\u201dThey\u2019ve put their blood, sweat and tears into the place \u2014 Mr. Sorrentino received a dozen stitches between his eyes after he was struck by a wayward wheelbarrow careening off the side of a dump truck.The house is still uninhabitable, although the men have undeniably added value to the neighborhood. \u201cBefore we were here, the whole yard was overgrown,\u201d said Mr. Carbonara, the de facto project leader. And ever since Mr. Sorrentino power-washed a neighbor\u2019s deck, she has regularly treated the men to homemade lunches of chicken parmigiana and meatball sandwiches.And as the house has tested their tempers, it has also tested their initial resolve: Whether the buddies will move in together, or resell the house when it\u2019s finally done, is up in the air.Buying a place with other people has predictable pitfalls.\u201cWhen people purchase property together, they become jointly liable for all the expenses,\u201d said Jaime Lathrop, a lawyer in Park Slope, Brooklyn, who handles real estate litigation and transactions. \u201cIf one person wants to sell, then they can force a sale, with very limited exceptions. If people go in on loans, it\u2019s a great way to wreck your credit. Each person should retain their own attorney to advise them on their rights and responsibilities.\u201dStuart Berg, a partner in the real estate department of the New York firm Kurzman Eisenberg Corbin & Lever, said it\u2019s essential to map certain things out in advance of a group purchase.\u201cDecide how the property will be owned. Will it be owned by an entity such as a limited liability company or individually?\u201d he said. Owning under an L.L.C. can protect buyers from personal risk and may offer certain tax benefits.\u201cIt\u2019s essential to determine up front the financial arrangements of each party and whether each party will be entitled to the full use and enjoyment of the property,\u201d Mr. Berg added. It\u2019s also important to put in writing what would happen \u201cif one party cannot meet his or her agreed-upon financial obligations.\u201dThe group reached a new level of closeness when they took out a mortgage together. \u201cIt came out to $30,000 apiece, all in,\u201d Mr. Schneyer said. \u201cThe down payment was $19,000 a head. And then the other 10 or 11 thousand covered H.V.A.C., furnishings, everything. That\u2019s not a trivial amount, but it\u2019s on par with what other people are putting in mutual funds and things like that. It\u2019s just a different type of investment.\u201dLindsay Liu didn\u2019t think twice about turning to her sister and Mr. Schneyer when she and her boyfriend, who does not wish to be named, started looking for a new place to live in Brooklyn.\u201cI started talking to these guys about it and said: \u2018Why don\u2019t we do it? It\u2019s going to give us the ability to look in a higher price range,\u2019 \u201d she recalled.In August 2015, Christy Liu, Mr. Schneyer and Lindsay Liu and her boyfriend purchased a one-bedroom duplex in Williamsburg for $839,000. The apartment is occupied by Lindsay Liu and her boyfriend, who pay rent. \u201cIf we were to sell today we\u2019d make a profit,\u201d she said.To avoid problems, the team has created an agreement for housing that\u2019s very much like a prenup.\u201cThe key factor is having these discussions upfront,\u201d Mr. Schneyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you have to figure every possible scenario, but it\u2019s about talking through them and building the possibilities into the operating agreement.\u201dPotential scenarios: What if one of the couples breaks up? What if someone runs into financial difficulty and wants to withdraw? \u201cEven if it\u2019s your spouse, there are the same risks,\u201d Mr. Schneyer said. \u201cIt happens all the time, people split up and you have to figure things out.\u201dAs for home design by committee, they figured that out, too. For the Catskill house they use a shared Pinterest account to \u201cupvote\u201d and \u201cdownvote\u201d furnishings, including everything from sofas to doorknobs.\u201cMost people use Pinterest to fantasize about their dream house. We\u2019re actually using it to create the real thing,\u201d Lindsay Liu said.While group home-buying ventures may seem novel to these forward-thinking friends, the blueprint is tried and true.For the Blyer brother and sister team, friends and family going in together on property is nothing new \u2014 their parents paved the way. Linda and Al Blyer purchased their home in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn in 1981 by pooling funds with one of Mr. Blyer\u2019s fellow workers. The two families still share the two-family house, these days with visiting grandchildren often filling the backyard with activity and laughter.\u201cIt was the same thing back then, they were young professionals with families and they couldn\u2019t afford to get something on their own, so they went in together,\u201d Jonathan Blyer said. \u201cAnd here we are, 35 years later, doing the same thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The entry to the multiple occupancy townhouse was redolent with cat litter. The centerpiece of the show was in his bedroom closet.Since the 2008 economic downturn, temporary do-it-yourself art galleries have proliferated in apartments, storefronts and other spaces all over the country. Call it a response to an art world in which dealer representation is increasingly hard to come by; exhibitions are costly; and formerly affordable areas like Bushwick have priced out artists, forcing them to seek out scrappier locations in which to show their work.But these self-starting galleries also signify a growing effort by artists \u2014 both emerging and established \u2014 to find community in an increasingly stratified art world and to wrest control of their careers from the curators and dealers who determine which works are seen. They are taking matters into their own hands by promoting and connecting with one another.These home galleries are generally not moneymaking ventures. While a few might take a cut of the sales, most aim to just show the work and create ferment among artists and potential buyers. They bypass the commercial gallery system and its chic white-box formality.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to be an artist in New York City,\u201d said Carole Server, a collector who attended Mr. Eddy\u2019s show. \u201cStudio space is incredibly expensive and difficult to find, and you face a lot of rejection. How many artists get some recognition?\u201d\u201cA decade ago, collectors would buy works straight out of your graduate school studio and there was a feeling of cutthroat competitiveness,\u201d Ms. Weiner said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to be competitive right now.\u201dSeveral of the artists featured in these unorthodox shows are already established professionals, like Mr. Johnson, for example, who had a solo show at Sikkema Jenkins & Co in New York in 2010 and has been featured in group exhibitions at Marlborough Chelsea and the Sculpture Center.\u201cThe big thing is just having a show, no matter where it is,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t always an opportunity to show someplace, so you just make your own opportunity.\u201dSarah Meyohas, an artist who recently received an M.F.A. from Yale, runs a gallery in the apartment she grew up in on the Upper East Side. \u201cWhen we were in school, we had critiques,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018How can we have something that\u2019s sort of like the next step?\u2019 This is the way I could engage in a really direct way with other people\u2019s work. It\u2019s made me a better artist.\u201dSome of these galleries aim to redress what many perceive as a market that favors artists who are white and male.\u201cIn some ways, I was interested in doing it because I was angry about what I was seeing around me,\u201d said Violet Dennison, 27, one of the artists who started Violet\u2019s Cafe, which is currently on hiatus. \u201cAll the artists that were showing were men. I felt like I had nowhere to be; there was nothing that represented me.\u201dTo be sure, sometimes showing art in your home can be inconvenient.\u201cThe downside of it was having a lot of people in my apartment,\u201d said Katie Geha, 36, a writer and art historian, who until recently ran a gallery in her Austin, Tex., apartment. \u201cBut the upside was that I really did become part of an art community.\u201dSometimes visitors showed up at odd hours.\u201cPeople would knock on my door,\u201d Ms. Geha said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d answer in my pajamas.\u201dMs. Geha went so far as to accommodate an artist in residence: Jeff DeGolier, who constructed a large installation in her living room out of trash he found around Austin during his week sleeping on Ms. Geha\u2019s lime green sofa.\u201cLiving with that piece was extremely difficult,\u201d she said.Some galleries that started below the radar have gradually earned greater attention from curators and critics, like Pierogi, Reena Spaulings and Regina Rex, all on the Lower East Side.Still, artists say most galleries that operate on the margins these days are not meant to be steppingstones to the mainstream. They have become an important way for a greater number of artists to have influence and to make their own art world.\u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we want to hang out with other artists,\u201d said Ms. Weiner of the Willows. \u201cArtists are the ones who are creating the buzz.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential.I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not.Notice how today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses.Yahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed.I will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers.Problem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn\u2019t the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully.It\u2019s probably more nuanced than this, but we\u2019re out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Over the last year, Jessica Dimson, a photo editor on the Politics desk of The New York Times, has helped lead a team of photographers in covering 50 primaries and caucuses, 21 debates and countless campaign events. Ms. Dimson, who graduated from Yale, joined the Times in 2011, working as a photo editor on the Metro and National desks. Prior to The Times, she was a photo editor at Departures and Vanity Fair. What makes a great political photograph? A great political photograph has the qualities of any great photograph \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an evocative confluence of aesthetic, emotional and historical elements. But one of the unique challenges of political photography is that the subject matter is often familiar, so a photograph that is surprising, sophisticated, analytical or subtle can really elevate a political photo. Campaign stops often are highly-restrictive, stage-managed events, so any photo that penetrates that or goes beyond what a campaign wants you to see is important. And often those photographs are not of the candidate themselves. There is magic in the periphery.  Why do we commit so many resources to covering the presidential campaign photographically? There are many wire service photographers from A.P., Reuters and others at every event and we can use their photos. Why do you want a New York Times photographer too? There are a lot of great wire photographers on the trail, but I think what we bring something different than the wires.  A hallmark of Times political photography is that we encourage our photographers to take risks in how they document the campaign. That is reflected both in what they shoot and what we decide to publish. Also, many of our photographers have covered presidential campaigns before. They understand the rhythms and the dynamics and they bring a context to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come before 2016. I think that is invaluable.  I think we want our photographers to be reporters as well.  That is what they do every day on the trail. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just documenting what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in front of the camera, but bringing context and nuance to the coverage.  We have many experienced staff photographers in the campaign this year but also several freelance photographers who work regularly for us. What traits do you look for in a potential campaign photographer?  We have a number of very talented freelancers on the trail this year, some of whom are photographing a presidential campaign for the first time.I give this recommendation to anyone who is new to working with us: We know what the candidate looks like.  That is a signal that we want you to take risks, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s O.K. to shoot to the right if all of the photographers standing next to you are shooting to the left. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow the pack. And we do not expect every photo to be of the candidate and welcome a less literal approach.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involved in supervising The New York Times photographic coverage of campaigns?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part editor and part facilitator. A lot of my job is looking at and selecting images, but a lot of time is also devoted to handling the logistics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which photographer is traveling with a candidate, keeping track of the candidate schedule (at one time there were 20 candidates, so there was a lot to juggle), helping photographers move from point A to point B and making sure we meet deadlines. I speak with photographers on the road about what they are seeing out there \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they are reporters as well as photographers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and give guidance about what we might be interested in on a particular day. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t direct how or what should be photographed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our photographers dictate that. And sometimes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just there to listen. They are often working 18-hour days and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taxing out there on the road. There are also more than 20 political reporters, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m working alongside them to conceptualize ways that we can best illustrate their stories. Is it difficult to get access for our photographers? There are challenges with both campaigns. As a news organization, we always want more access to the candidates. They are on an extensive job interview with the entire country, and we believe that we should be able to fully document that process and all that comes with it. The term the \u00e2\u0080\u0098campaign trail\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a bit of a misnomer this year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the reality is that both Clinton and Trump often fly in for a single event in a day, speak for 20 minutes, and fly out right after. There are no bus tours or diner stops. In some cases, we are relegated to shoot from literal pens in the back of an auditorium. That is frustrating and we speak up about that. So there is an ongoing conversation about access with the campaigns.   So your first presidential national party conventions are coming up. How do you plan for something like this? This is no small undertaking. We have about 10 photographers traveling to Philadelphia and Cleveland, and all of our staff photographers who are going have covered conventions in past years. Some will spend most of their time covering the action inside the arena, while others will be dedicated to covering and tracking protests and the scene outside.Events like these are where The Times really excels at giving readers an unvarnished and immediate sense of what is transpiring. We have the ability to transmit photographs very quickly, often in a matter of seconds, and can then publish them on our site and to social media platforms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a few seconds after that. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt to explain all of the in-depth technical aspects because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m lucky to work with people who understand it better than I do and make it all happen, but we have hard-wired lines at various spots in the arena and photographers will filing directly from their cameras. There are other aspects involving power supplies, routers, and remotes, but I leave that to the experts. I will be in the arena editing photos as they come, and another photo editor on the politics desk, Morrigan McCarthy, will be onsite as well. Tanner Curtis, who works on the National desk, will be editing in New York.We can adjust our coverage based on how things transpire over the next two weeks. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very nimble in that way. We also have photographers who are going to be traveling with each candidate before their arrival at their respective convention.  The Times often gets complaints about coverage, often by both sides of an issue or a presidential campaign. What does fairness mean in visual political coverage? Fairness is of paramount importance to us, and if you view our coverage in totality over the course of the last 15 months, I think you will find that we are balanced in how we represent the campaigns visually. We are mindful not just of which images run, but also how they run \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the context in which an image is published, the prominence of a particular story, is it a news item or a more analytical piece \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of those are factors in our decision. This is a particularly polarizing election and readers may have strong feelings about certain images. Politics is a very personal issue for most people, and I welcome the dialogue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 differing interpretations of a photograph are valuable and essential to the medium. For the most part, when we do get feedback it has been very positive. I think that our audience values a less-traditional approach to our visual coverage.  "}

The funky smell usually lasts 24 to 36 hours.When it didn\u2019t bloom last weekend as projected, the staff went on high alert.\u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for a baby to be born \u2014 we\u2019re all pacing back and forth,\u201d Mr. Hachadourian said.\u201cAnd unfortunately, we can\u2019t induce.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Nothing new on this front, except that from here on out, the insufferable heat should very gradually taper off.Thank goodness.But if you plan to hop aboard this week, be advised that it\u2019s running on a modified schedule until further notice.Construction on the water is slowing the operation down, said Paul Goodman, chief executive of BillyBey Ferry Company, which runs the East River Ferry.One bit of good news: The weekend schedule is unaffected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mayor Fluent in Twitter Embodies a New Canadian Diversity", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileFor a Muslim man who broke ground when he was elected mayor of a major North American city in 2010, Mr. Nenshi has proved that very few Canadians have a problem with how His Worship actually worships. \u201cNobody cared,\u201d he said, recalling his first win, a success he repeated in 2013, with 74 percent of the vote.The son of ethnic South Asian immigrants from Tanzania and a professed public transit nerd, Mr. Nenshi has thrived in a city and country where personal attacks and cultural issues capture little of the political oxygen that has inflamed voters in the United States and Europe.The city\u2019s demographic shift is a microcosm of Canada\u2019s integration of immigrants, and Mr. Nenshi, who fasts during Ramadan and has led Calgary\u2019s gay pride parade, embodies the country\u2019s increasingly diverse population. Still, Mr. Nenshi is the first nonwhite mayor of Calgary and among the few in a nation that is 80 percent white, according to a 2011 government survey.Then there is Mr. Nenshi\u2019s fixation with purple. The color symbolizes his commitment to inclusive, nonideological government and dominates his professional wardrobe: lavender dress shirts, violet ties, purple shoelaces, loafers the color of grapes. A local rabbi gave him a purple skullcap, shipped from New York, inscribed with his name. In his office hallway, a framed illustration depicts the mayor as a caped superhero in purple spandex.Born in Toronto and raised in a Calgary neighborhood that was already a mix of cultures and languages, Mr. Nenshi grew up keenly aware of the need for civic participation. After obtaining a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Harvard, he worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company before returning to Calgary, where he eventually became a university professor, teaching nonprofit management and marketing.Mr. Nenshi\u2019s journey into government reads like a do-it-yourself guide to disrupting politics as usual. For years, he pursued his wonkish passions strictly from an academic distance, writing reports on how Canadian cities, including Calgary, could become more environmentally sustainable and economically competitive. A failed run for the City Council in 2004 confirmed his role as an outsider.But five years later, with elections for the Council and mayor looming in 2010, he began encouraging corporate chief executives, soccer moms and other Calgary residents to run. \u201cI struck out every time,\u201d he recalled.Then friends challenged him to run for mayor, an idea he initially rejected. \u201cI like research; I do the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the guy kissing the babies.\u201dBut the campaign proved a tempting chance for Mr. Nenshi to turn years of public policy recommendations into action. Along with a group of volunteers that encompassed Calgary\u2019s diverse population, the college professor created a grass-roots strategy aimed at harnessing social media\u2019s potential to engage the city\u2019s traditionally apathetic young and minority residents.More than 33 miles of bicycle paths have been installed across Calgary since 2011. Despite vocal opposition and a close City Council vote, Mr. Nenshi championed a downtown bike network pilot project that was built last year and is now favored by most residents.\u201cNenshi has always been the guy who can help people get motivated to bring about change,\u201d said James Boettcher, a Calgary gelato entrepreneur who pitched the idea of food trucks to the mayor in 2011.The mayor\u2019s popular personal style, which he says is perhaps too unscripted, comes with some risks. \u201cMy mouth still gets me into trouble once in a while,\u201d he said. Much of that public interaction occurs on Twitter, starting when he wakes up in the morning and continuing until lights out.\u201cNobody else has my password,\u201d he said, explaining his more than 47,000 Twitter messages as a vital means of addressing constituents\u2019 needs and improving municipal government. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know the answer sometimes, I Google it for them.\u201dMr. Nenshi is perhaps most famous beyond Calgary for his online \u201csmackdowns.\u201d These range from giving polite advice to a driver who demanded an end to parking tickets (\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe consider not breaking the law\u201d) to challenging personal insults. (\u201cYour casual racism can be fun, but you really need to stop before people actually notice.\u201d)Still, he is happy to inspire his critics to do more than just rant online, even if that means being voted out of office. As he told one Twitter user eager for his electoral defeat: \u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance in 2017! Better start organizing now, though.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Mike Pence Satisfy the Insatiable Right?", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump can be a lot of things: outrageous, bigoted, mercurial, funny, unthinking and relentless. But in this long presidential campaign he has not been dull \u2014 until, that is, he selected Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate.It\u2019s relatively obvious why Trump picked Pence, a Midwesterner and one of the Republicans who turned the House G.O.P. caucus into a right-wing fringe movement dominated by politicians who want to make their version of Christian values the driving force in government. He is, as he once put it, \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\u201dPresumably Trump and his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, thought that picking Pence would please Midwesterners, Christians and hard-core conservatives. Certainly, Manafort knows a crazy right-winger when he sees one. He made his Washington bones lobbying on behalf of dictators like the Angolan butcher Jonas Savimbi, Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine.Trump\u2019s pickings were slim. He reportedly was down to people like Newt Gingrich, whose only real achievement was leading the campaign to take the House for Republicans in 1994 and getting forced out of the speakership a few years later; and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose lack of skill at presidential campaigning in the 2016 cycle was positively breathtaking.The G.O.P. is, if nothing else, fairly disciplined. And where else would those voters go? They hate Hillary Clinton a lot more than they care whether Trump is sincere when he mouths the intolerant slogans of their movement. (Clinton could use that kind of partisan loyalty from the Bernie Sanders crowd.)After prominent businesses based in Indiana objected, Pence engineered a \u201cfix\u201d that supposedly would prevent discrimination. The religious right howled in protest, and some are still howling.\u201cWhile we conservatives need to continue to educate Donald Trump on our issues, no one doubts that Trump has the courage to stand for what he believes, no matter who or what the opposition,\u201d Viguerie said. (He may be the only person who knows what Trump believes, including Trump.)\u201cThe same,\u201d Viguerie went on, \u201ccannot be said for Governor Pence, who, although already well-versed in limited government constitutional conservative policy principles and Christian thinking about government, abandoned those principles in the face of opposition from radical homosexuals and principle-free business interests.\u201dViguerie said Pence\u2019s \u201cspineless retreat\u201d under \u201cpressure from the radical homosexual lobby is indicative of a problem we face throughout our culture, and especially in the conservative movement, and that is a lack of moral courage in the face of evil.\u201dThere you have it. To Viguerie and others on the American far right, evil is defined by people standing up for their rights and protesting discrimination in a democratic way.Did Trump really need to make another offering to people who think like that?Advertisement"}

Their task is to nominate the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the election in November. There is a single contender: Donald J.

Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives and the highest-ranking elected Republican. Mr. Ryan has openly clashed with Mr. Trump on his most contentious proposals, but has agreed to row behind the Trump candidacy for the sake of party unity.What about the streets outside?Real guns, though, are allowed: Ohio is one of several states to allow licensed gun owners to carry their weapons openly.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Is a Case Study in Poor Timing", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsYahoo has fittingly closed a portal on tech mergers and acquisitions.The company\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon caps two decades of deals and non-deals that shaped internet history. Yahoo got lucky with Alibaba, but failed to capitalize on its dominance by not acquiring companies like Google, Facebook and eBay. Spurning Microsoft also was a mistake. It is a one-company textbook on timing.Yahoo, the web creation of Jerry Yang and David Filo, captured the popular embrace of the internet back in 1994, and a large chunk of the internet\u2019s value along with it. Its market capitalization once exceeded $140 billion, and it even occupied the exclusive Boardwalk spot in a dot-com edition of the Monopoly board game. It failed, however, to anticipate how technology would supplant human curation of the web.Its overpriced stock was successfully deployed during the heady days of tech mayhem in the 1990s, but put to poor use. It spent $3.6 billion on the web-hosting service GeoCities and another $5.7 billion on the early internet-radio service Broadcast.com. Both services eventually faded away. Yahoo first ignored Google and then quibbled over a price tag that was lower than Broadcast\u2019s. Mark Zuckerberg likewise rejected a $1 billion offer for his fledgling Facebook.Yahoo kept showcasing its inverse Midas touch. The internet-ad auction firm Overture, the photo-sharing service Flickr and other promising start-ups simply were clouded by Yahoo\u2019s miasma.It is exceptionally tough to arrest a tech business in decline. The Alibaba deal, however, gave Yahoo the financial firepower to subsist for longer than it otherwise might have. In 2005, it contributed its own Chinese business and $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba, an investment now worth some $30 billion. The lack of self-awareness by the founders about Yahoo\u2019s faltering health, however, was its downfall. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo torpedoed the generous $45 billion takeover offer in 2008 from a then-panicky Microsoft.In the end, Yahoo may have managed to gin up a frothier auction than it deserved and thus fetched an outsize price from Verizon. It will be little consolation given what might have been. At least Yahoo has left behind a case study in M.&A. that should be of significant value.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Live Streaming Breaks Through, and Cable News Has Much to Fear", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtWhat we saw last week was live streaming\u2019s Gulf War, a moment that will catapult the technology into the center of the news \u2014 and will begin to inexorably alter much of television news as we know it. And that\u2019s not a bad thing. Though it will shake up the economics of TV, live streaming is opening up a much more compelling way to watch the news.These scenes suggest that streaming apps don\u2019t just have the potential to bring us stories more quickly than TV can. They also greatly expand on the kind of stories you normally see. Streaming news stretches our collective point of view, showing us perspectives from people who might otherwise have been ignored by the news, and from places where television cameras would never have happened to be.\u201cI think we saw last week that Facebook Live could become the most intelligent cable news network ever built,\u201d said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN, who now runs a digital media company called Tapp. With more than 1.65 billion users, he said, \u201cFacebook effectively has one and a half billion news bureaus to capture news, and they\u2019re capable of doing things that a cable news network could only dream of doing.\u201dSoon you might log on to Facebook and see, right at the top of your feed, a collection of videos produced by professionals and amateurs and tailored to your interests \u2014 breaking news and analysis related to topics you like, all of which load instantly in your feed, ad-free, and without any of the constant, interminable waiting for stuff to happen that characterizes traditional cable news.Now that rampart is disappearing. If you turned on one of the cable news networks last week, you would have most likely seen videos lifted straight from streaming apps playing in endless televised loops. If you watched for more than a few minutes, you would have been forgiven for wondering, \u201cWait, if all this video is coming from Facebook, why am I watching TV?\u201dIn the past, an aged audience might not have raised red flags, because it was generally the case that younger people grew into their parents\u2019 news habits. But as online alternatives improve, the less likely that is to happen.\u201cThe next generation just doesn\u2019t ever intend to watch the 6 o\u2019clock or 11 o\u2019clock or any other newscast,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News who is now a visiting researcher at the MIT Media Lab.It\u2019s possible to make too much of the threat that live streaming poses to TV news. \u201cCitizen journalism\u201d has gotten a lot of attention from techno-optimists in the last decade, but blogging, tweeting, podcasting and everything else haven\u2019t replaced traditional journalism so much as they have expanded its tone and range. That\u2019s likely to happen on TV too; streaming apps won\u2019t kill CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, but as the apps become more popular, they will force TV news providers to shift their approach to coverage.\u201cThe more chaotic and unstructured the world of online live video becomes, the more important the curator, analyst or honest broker of information can be,\u201d Mr. Heyward said.In the best situation, TV news could become just such an honest broker: Instead of showing you only the news of the day and the most superficial hot-take debates surrounding it, TV networks could respond to the internet by pumping more resources into in-depth reporting, analysis and explanation, cultivating a wider range of perspectives.As Mr. Klein put it, \u201cMaybe all these years, the importance of scintillating video has been overblown, and the mission for news outlets could be to help viewers understand what all that video really means.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Get Paid to Do Nothing", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionI\u2019m not quite sure what training is required to stand in place and occasionally shuffle forward, but maybe there is more skill to waiting in line than meets the eye. And it seems that Italy is not the only bureaucratically overwhelmed nation with its own waiting industry.Brazil has its \u201cdespachantes,\u201d meaning dispatchers. Venezuela has its \u201ccoleros,\u201d which, oddly, can translate to \u201ctop hats\u201d; and Spain its \u201cgestores\u201d or agents. Meanwhile, in South Africa there is a company called Q4U that takes care specifically of the irksome business of applying for a British passport.In New York City, the cash-rich and time-poor use the service Same Ole Line Dudes, which describes itself as \u201cNew York\u2019s only professional line sitting team.\u201d The Dudes will charge you $25 for the first hour, plus $10 for each additional 30 minutes, to put in the necessary time to obtain coveted concert tickets or rare new sneakers. Their slogan is, \u201cWe wait for your wants.\u201d I am told that they will even wait at the Department of Motor Vehicles for you.It can be only a matter of time before the old established industry of waiting in line is disrupted by the arrival of a new digital start-up with a name like LineRabbit and trading on some slogan like \u201cWe wait so you can live.\u201d Its app would feature a simple step-by-swipe tutorial:1. Click the \u201cwait in line for me\u201d button.2. One of our specially trained LineRabbits will wait in your specified line for you.3. Pay now. All cards accepted.To be sure, that\u2019s only a fraction of the time that the Italians spend dawdling at the post office or at city hall. But it\u2019s still a significant chunk of potentially productive time down the drain. The Economist\u2019s analysts would no doubt find this irritatingly inefficient and would feel impelled to quantify it: \u201cmillions lost to British industry through queuing.\u201dThese otherwise wasted hours have, at least, provided me with ample time to study the art of waiting in line and identify emerging trends in queuing culture.One recent innovation is the split line. When there are multiple tellers or service representatives, forming a separate line for each is a recipe for queue rage \u2014 since some law of nature dictates that yours always seems the slowest moving. In supermarkets, for airport security and at train-station ticket offices, the process is generally formalized, with roped-off routing.But the system has caught on informally, too: I have noticed that people here, through some form of telepathic communication, will wordlessly organize their own split-line systems on the sidewalk while waiting for their turn at a row of A.T.M.s. This spontaneous self-organizing principle is a happy example of anarchy in action.And waiting has become far less tedious since the rise of the smartphone. While waiting at the supermarket, we can now catch up with emails or read the newspaper.Though these excellent approaches reduce the boredom and frustration of waiting in line, there is another solution to the problem \u2014 which is to see the time spent as not wasted at all.After all, we complain all day about being too busy. Then, when provided with the chance to do nothing for a few minutes, we complain again. Why not take the opportunity to practice a bit of mindfulness? Breathe, glow, get out your adult coloring book.Granted, this is easier said than done. If you have ever found yourself amid the less happy anarchy of an undisciplined, four-deep throng at a bar on a Friday night, hoping to order a round of craft ales, you will know what I mean.This kind of wait would test the Dalai Lama\u2019s inner calm: Bartenders seem to have no sense of queuing fairness, and it is always, so far as I can see, the loudest, pushiest and most flamboyant customers who get served first. Wait patiently, trust in natural justice and you will be sober and thirsty.As a typical member of the creative middle classes \u2014 that is, a full-time media slacker \u2014 I have found my income shrinking over the last few years. It\u2019s something to do with the internet and Facebook. So I\u2019m thinking that maybe codista might not be such a bad job. I could do it pretty well.For the constitutionally lazy, it\u2019s surely up there with \u201cbed tester\u201d as an ideal occupation.

{"Headline": "Shooting at Nightclub in Fort Myers, Florida, Leaves 2 Teenagers Dead", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byFORT MYERS, Fla. \u2014 Two teenagers were killed and at least 18 people were wounded early Monday when attackers raked a crowd with gunfire outside a nightclub here that had been hosting a party for young people, the authorities said.Witnesses said multiple gunmen opened fire at about 12:30 a.m. outside the nightclub, Club Blu, in a palm-tree-lined strip mall in this southwestern Florida city.Officials refused to discuss a possible motive, but \u201cthis was not a terrorist act,\u201d Dennis Eads, the interim Fort Myers police chief, said at an afternoon news conference. \u201cWe have three persons of interest in custody \u2014 I\u2019m not going to go into who they are \u2014 and we are still looking for others.\u201dResidents of the neighborhood around the club said the area had been troubled by drug dealing and violence.A Facebook user calling herself Juss Olivia posted a video shortly after the shooting, saying she had been sitting in a car across the street, near her apartment, when she heard gunfire and saw about five people \u201cspraying nonstop, running and shooting.\u201d She and her friends said they had joined a crowd fleeing on foot and ducking behind cars.The authorities identified the two victims who were killed as Sean Archilles, 14, and Stef\u2019An Strawder, 18, both budding basketball stars who had just left the club.Sean, a student at Royal Palm Exceptional School, was shot in the parking lot, and a girl with him was shot in a leg, said his brothers, John and Verly Francois. They stood outside their mother\u2019s house, where family and friends had gathered to comfort her, and said it was hard to believe that an innocent outing with friends had ended in the death of their youngest brother.\u201cThey were just walking to a friend\u2019s house about a block away,\u201d said John Francois, 19.Sean, the youngest of four brothers, stood just 5-foot-6, but he was a basketball fanatic whose brothers called him \u201cBaby Kevin Durant\u201d because he looked so much like the N.B.A. star and always had a basketball in his hand.\u201cHe really was like Kevin Durant; he could have been his son,\u201d Mr. Francois said. \u201cHe loved to play basketball. He was always down for that. That, or chilling at home.\u201dMr. Strawder, who went by the nickname Dee, was a star player at Lehigh Senior High School who would have been a senior in the fall and aspired to play college ball.Gov. Rick Scott, who traveled to Fort Myers to meet with local officials, said, \u201cNot one of us can imagine losing a young person like this.\u201dThe wounded ranged in age from 12 to 27, said Lisa Sgarlata, the chief administrative officer of Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers. One person died at the scene, one was pronounced dead at the hospital, and Lee Memorial treated 16 survivors, Ms. Sgarlata said.Jermaine Wilson, a witness to the aftermath of the shooting, said the parking lot had been filled with cars and loud music as the teenagers were departing the club.\u201cI saw everybody running,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, 32. \u201cA bunch of people were screaming names.\u201dSyreeta Gary said that her daughter, Anastasia, a 10th grader at Dunbar High School, had run from the scene holding hands with another girl but that they had been separated. Anastasia ducked between parked cars and curled up on the ground until the shooting stopped, the mother said.\u201cShe said she felt the pressure of three bullets flying past her before she dove between the cars,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Gary, 35, said. \u201cPeople were running everywhere.\u201dFort Myers police officers and Lee County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived within minutes and started tending to the injured, Chief Eads said. \u201cIt was very chaotic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was still very active. No one really knew what was going on.\u201dThat confusion was evident as the number of wounded climbed throughout the day. Some people took themselves to hospitals, unknown to emergency workers \u2014 some right away, some hours later. Joining Chief Eads and other officials at the news conference, the governor put the count at 18 injured and two dead.Fort Myers, with about 68,000 residents, is a fast-growing city with big-city problems, including gang violence and a high rate of poverty. Its rates of homicide and overall violent crime, according to F.B.I. reports, are about triple the national average.\u201cWe do have our own little knife-and-gun club that are responsible for anywhere from 8 to 15 percent of the traumas that we see,\u201d said Dr. Drew Mikulaschek, a trauma surgeon at Lee Memorial. But he said he had never seen so many people hurt in a shooting.A statement early Monday on the club\u2019s Facebook page said: \u201cWe are deeply sorry for all involved. We tried to give the teens what we thought was a safe place to have a good time.\u201dIt added, \u201cIt was not kids at the party that did this despicable act.\u201dIt was at least the second time in 14 months that shootings were reported just outside Club Blu. In May 2015, two nonfatal shootings took place within 35 minutes directly outside the club, a state regulator\u2019s investigative report said.Club Blu cultivated an image that often veered from homespun to risqu\u00e9. It advertises \u201cNew Orleans-style soul food\u201d and $6.99 lunch specials, but other ads depict the club as a racy hot spot with blaring music and flowing liquor.The club staged a \u201cgrand reopening\u201d in May to debut what it described as an improved building. In a corner of an ad for the event, the club made a promise: \u201cTIGHT SECURITY ALL NIGHT.\u201d This year, however, the club\u2019s liquor license was revoked.Lizette Alvarez reported from Fort Myers, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "The Right Way to Bribe Your Kids to Read", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byDispatchMy children need to read this summer. They\u2019re in the middle of a long vacation from school, and I want them to enjoy it \u2014 but I also want them to be able to pick up their education where they left off when school starts again in the fall.Kids who read over the summer lose fewer skills than kids who don\u2019t. This is especially important for children from low-income families and those with language problems, like my younger daughter. When reading is difficult, so is almost everything else. As new readers move from decoding text to fluency, every subject from math to history becomes more accessible, but practice is the only way to get there.My kids (15, 12, 10 and 10) have an enviable amount of time to read, and plenty of books to choose from. Yet it\u2019s already clear that beyond a late August dash to fulfill their assignments, very few pages are likely to be turned unless I do something. But what?\u201cIf you pay kids to read you\u2019ll get them to read,\u201d said Edward Deci, the author of \u201cWhy We Do What We Do\u201d and a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester. \u201cThey\u2019ll continue to read until you end the experiment, and then they\u2019ll stop.\u201d Rewards encourage children to think of reading as something you have to be paid to do, not something that brings pleasure in itself, he says.But if offering an incentive for reading is such a terrible idea, why does it still seem so common, even among parents who are aware of the pitfalls?Perhaps my peers and I are too prone to valuing short-term wins over long-term learning (witness our tendency to \u201chelp\u201d our children with homework). Or perhaps we just know how important reading is \u2014 and care more that our kids are good at it than that they love it.Some experts actually agree that rewards can be useful, especially for younger learners. \u201cI think we underestimate the power of extrinsic motivation,\u201d said Rahil Briggs, director of pediatric behavioral health at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. \u201cYou want your child to be naturally fascinated, and some are, but some children can benefit from a little bit of a jump-start.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude the development of intrinsic motivation later, Dr. Briggs said. Although some children love a challenge, for many, it\u2019s hard to find pleasure in reading until it comes easily.And when it comes to developing reading fluency, timing is important. Fumiko Hoeft, a cognitive neuroscientist and psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, has found that the growth of particular neural pathways when children are young is critical to reading success. \u201cLearning to read requires that we integrate the auditory, speech and visual processes,\u201d she said. In evolutionary terms, it\u2019s a new skill for humankind, and not one we perform instinctively. That kind of learning requires repetition.What if, instead of focusing on developing a long-term love of literature, we focused on the short-term act of reading itself? That might change the calculus for parents, Dr. Briggs said. Some research suggests that external rewards work well for short-term interventions. \u201cOne of the downfalls of extrinsic motivation is that you just have to keep upping the ante to get the same result,\u201d she said. But summer has a natural end, and then school takes over.If parents do want to offer rewards for reading, Dr. Briggs said, they don\u2019t necessarily have to be money, treats or toys: \u201cIt could be that it\u2019s a special thing to go to the library with Dad, and that the alone time is part of what\u2019s rewarding about it.\u201dSuch nonmaterial rewards may be the most effective. Dr. Deci of the University of Rochester and his colleague and collaborator, Richard Ryan, suggest that if reading is something parents value, then it\u2019s the value, rather than the practice and the skill, that we should emphasize. The \u201cbribe\u201d of an excursion with a parent, or of special time reading together or discussing a book, conveys the importance of reading, said Dr. Ryan. \u201cWhen we set aside time for reading, or set limits on other activities, we\u2019re showing our children that we support them in developing an important skill.\u201dWhen I talked further with the parents who told me that they offered rewards for reading, I found that what looked like bribes were actually closer to what Dr. Deci and Dr. Ryan sought. Payments came with lengthy book discussions. One family went from offering rewards one year to running a book club the next. Parents reflected on years of star charts and prizes, along with years of family trips to the library. Bets were made over who could read the most, and late-night reading under the covers with a flashlight was indulged and encouraged. What I saw \u2014 when I really looked \u2014 were external motivations to read accompanied by powerful messages about the internal joy to be found in books.\u201cI think intrinsic motivation is a bit of a learned skill,\u201d said Judi Fusco Kledzik, a friend and learning sciences researcher who initially surprised me by saying that she offers her daughters (now 14, 12 and 10) a penny a page for summer reading and has done so for five years. \u201cSo is regulating how you spend your time.\u201d This way, she says, her daughters are inspired to find new books (the books must be grade-level ones they haven\u2019t read before) and to sit down with them. The family spends considerable time, she said, setting goals and talking about the books the girls read.None of which sounds as easy as just handing over that penny a page. Does it work?\u201cI would read more books without the program,\u201d said Dr. Kledzik\u2019s oldest daughter, \u201cbut easier books, and more comic books.\u201d Her 12-year-old sister doesn\u2019t think she reads more or different books than she would on her own, but the youngest girl does. \u201cMoney is motivating,\u201d the 10-year-old said.Money may be motivating, but so is living in a home where books and reading are part of family life \u2014 and it\u2019s that, rather than the various reward programs, that I plan to focus on at our house. Bribes, Dr. Briggs noted, are relatively easy, and many children know it. Reading together, choosing books, talking about words and stories, or even going to the library is \u201ca lot harder than taking a dollar out of our wallets,\u201d she said, and ultimately worth a lot more.An earlier version of this article omitted the results of a British survey about children\u2019s reading habits. Sixty percent of parents of 3- to 8-year-olds said they offered their children rewards for reading.KJ Dell\u2019Antonia is a columnist and contributing editor to The New York Times\u2019s Well Family.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambodia at a Point of No Return", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 For days now, tens of thousands of mourners, rich and poor, from the cities and from the countryside, have been visiting Wat Chas pagoda to pay their respects to Kem Ley. A prominent political commentator, Kem Ley, 45 , was shot dead on July 10 over his morning coffee in a mini-mart in central Phnom Penh.He was known across Cambodia for his plain-spoken criticism of Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s government and occasionally my own party, the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (C.N.R.P.), earning himself a reputation for being above the fray. In 2014, he created Khmer for Khmer, an advocacy group promoting civic engagement. It spawned the Grassroots Democracy Party, which plans to run in local elections in 2017 and the general election in 2018.After gunning him down, the killer escaped on foot, until a mob that had gathered on his trail beat him. He was taken into custody by the police. The man first identified himself as \u201cMeet Kill,\u201d and claimed to have shot Kem Ley over a debt. That story seems implausible, and relatives of both men have since reportedly said they didn\u2019t think the two knew one another. And so the killer\u2019s motives remain unclear, as does the question of whether he acted on anyone\u2019s orders.What already is clear, however, is that many Cambodians believe Kem Ley died for his political beliefs, and few have much faith in the investigation the government has promised to conduct. Whatever the truth behind Kem Ley\u2019s death, the event already seems to mark a point of no return in public opinion: The fracture between the people and the government may now be irrevocable.For a while in 2014 the government seemed willing to cooperate with the C.N.R.P., but then it dropped even the semblance of that. For close to a year now, various officials, the courts and other public institutions have hounded opposition lawmakers, environmental and labor activists and members of civil society \u2014 anyone, basically, who asks hard questions.Two C.N.R.P. parliamentarians have been imprisoned, in violation of their constitutionally protected parliamentary immunity, on charges that they posted online documents that inaccurately describe Cambodia\u2019s border with Vietnam. Several opposition M.P.s face charges of insurrection for leading in July 2014 a peaceful protest calling for freedom of speech and assembly that devolved into violence after state security forces intervened.Four members of Adhoc, one of the country\u2019s leading human rights organizations, have been imprisoned for allegedly bribing a witness in the case against Kem Sokha. So has one member of the National Election Commission, the body tasked with redrawing voter registration lists ahead of the next elections. A staffer from the United Nations\u2019 human rights office in Phnom Penh has also been charged in relation to the case.These instances of repression are the direct work of state organs, whereas the motives behind Kem Ley\u2019s murder remain murky. But people are wary and angry, and they are likely to be skeptical of any conclusion reached by a government investigation.Immediately after he was shot, people at the scene gathered around his body to protect it, turned his car into a makeshift hearse and in an impromptu funeral march escorted it to the pagoda. Others quickly rallied to find out the killer\u2019s real name by disseminating his photo on Facebook.Mu Sochua is a member of the National Assembly of Cambodia from the Cambodia National Rescue Party and a board member of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Last Charges Dropped Against Abortion Foes in Making of Planned Parenthood Video", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 A judge dismissed Tuesday the last of the charges against two anti-abortion activists who covertly recorded a video of themselves meeting with Planned Parenthood officials, effectively ending a case that had drawn national attention from both opponents and supporters of abortion rights.At a hearing in the case on Tuesday, prosecutors with the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office asked the judge to dismiss the charges, citing a potential legal issue with the grand jury\u2019s term, which had been extended during the investigation. Mr. Daleiden\u2019s lawyers had argued that the grand jury did not have the authority to indict Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt during the extension, and prosecutors appeared to have agreed.\u201cThe grand jury took the investigation where the facts led it; however, Texas law limits what can be investigated after a grand jury extension order is issued,\u201d District Attorney Devon Anderson said in a statement. \u201cIn light of this and after careful research and review, this office dismissed the indictments.\u201dOne of Mr. Daleiden\u2019s lawyers, Jared Woodfill, said prosecutors could not bring a new target of investigation before grand jurors during an extension period.\u201cThe evidence that we had was very clear that David was never a target of an investigation during the original term, and so the indictment was fatally flawed,\u201d Mr. Woodfill said.The investigation had been politically fraught from its beginnings as an examination of Planned Parenthood. Abortion-rights supporters asserted that Ms. Anderson had a conflict of interest, citing a 2014 Facebook posting in which she announced an endorsement from an anti-abortion group and called herself \u201ca proud, pro-life Texan.\u201d Then when the case turned to center on Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt, abortion opponents cast the charges as politically motivated, citing a prosecutor\u2019s ties to Planned Parenthood.Last year, after Ms. Anderson announced that she was opening an investigation, an assistant district attorney in her office disclosed that she was a member of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast\u2019s board of directors. Ms. Anderson announced that disclosure publicly, and said the prosecutor would not be involved in the investigation. Ms. Anderson said she would consider having an independent prosecutor take over the case if information surfaced suggesting the investigation had been compromised.That did little to satisfy critics. \u201cThe indictment was politically motivated and should never have been filed in the first place,\u201d said Mathew D. Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a conservative nonprofit that represented Ms. Merritt.Prosecutors appeared unlikely to pursue the case. But separately, Planned Parenthood has sued Mr. Daleiden, Ms. Merritt and others in federal court in San Francisco over the videos. Officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Georgia and nine other states investigated the claims made in the videos that Planned Parenthood had profited illegally from sales of fetal tissue, and cleared the group of any wrongdoing. Officials in eight other states, including California and Colorado, declined to investigate, according to Planned Parenthood.\u201cThey spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood in order to advance their anti-abortion agenda,\u201d Melaney A. Linton, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to drop the prosecution on a technicality does not negate the fact that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the extremists behind this fraud.\u201dThe indictment stemmed from a meeting Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt had at the Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast offices in Houston in April 2015. They had been each indicted on felony charges of tampering with a governmental record with the intent to defraud, for using fake identity documents; Mr. Daleiden had faced an additional misdemeanor charge related to offering to purchase human organs. The misdemeanor charge was dropped by a judge several weeks ago.Advertisement"}

And it is certainly not narcissistic to have a strong sense of self-confidence based on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNarcissism exists in many shades and degrees of severity along a continuum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Burgo said, and for well-known people he cites as extreme narcissists, he resists making an ad hoc diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association.The association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnostic manual lists a number of characteristics that describe narcissistic personality disorder, among them an impaired ability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others, grandiosity and feelings of entitlement, and excessive attempts to attract attention.Underlying their overt behavior, however, may be \u00e2\u0080\u009csecret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mayo experts wrote. To ward off these feelings when criticized, they \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay react with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Burgo, who sees clients by Skype from his home in Grand Lake, Colo., noted that many \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrandiose narcissists are drawn to politics, professional sports, and the entertainment industry because success in these fields allows them ample opportunity to demonstrate their winner status and to elicit admiration from others, confirming their defensive self-image as a superior being.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe causes of extreme narcissism are not precisely known. Theories include parenting styles that overemphasize a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special abilities and criticize his fears and failures, prompting a need to appear perfect and command constant attention.Although narcissism has not been traced to one kind of family background, Dr. Burgo wrote that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca surprising number of extreme narcissists have experienced some kind of early trauma or loss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d like parental abandonment. The family lives of several famous narcissists he describes, Lance Armstrong among them, are earmarked by \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple failed marriages, extreme poverty and an atmosphere of physical and emotional violence.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs bosses and romantic partners, narcissists can be insufferable, demanding perfection, highly critical and quick to rip apart the strongest of egos. Employee turnover in companies run by narcissists and divorce rates in people married to them are high.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best defense for employees who choose to stay is to protect the bosses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 egos and avoid challenging them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Burgo said in an interview. His general advice to those running up against extreme narcissists is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cremain sane and reasonable\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than engaging them in \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattles they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always win.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite their braggadocio, extreme narcissists are prone to depression, substance abuse and suicide when unable to fulfill their expectations and proclamations of being the best or the brightest.The disorder can be treated, though therapy is neither quick nor easy. It can take an insurmountable life crisis for those with the disorder to seek treatment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have to hit rock bottom, having ruined all their important relationships with their destructive behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Burgo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen very often.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNo drug can reverse a personality disorder. Rather, talk therapy can, over a period of years, help people better understand what underlies their feelings and behavior, accept their true competence and potential, learn to relate more effectively with other people and, as a result, experience more rewarding relationships.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Want to Attract More Readers? Try Listening to Them", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorMOST journalists I\u2019ve worked with have a reflexive aversion to interacting with readers. They subscribe to the view that editors and reporters have the most cultivated sense of which stories are most important, and which subjects most worthy of attention. Expecting them to consider the opinions of readers when making such journalistic decisions would be akin to asking an artist to produce a masterwork to accommodate the taste of a benefactor.More than most news organizations, The Times has hitched its future to building a loyal audience that will come back repeatedly and pay for the privilege of doing so. These readers contribute more than half of The Times\u2019s total revenue, almost unheard-of for a mass audience publisher. The goal is to double digital revenue within the next five years, and dedicated readers will be a key part of that. This means that instead of just chasing clicks \u2014 though the paper has begun to indulge in that, too \u2014 The Times hopes to make its content sufficiently unique and addictive that it turns frequent visitors into subscribers.The Times is keenly aware that readers are its most prized asset. But as a recent strategy report found, the company must be far more aggressive in reaching a broader audience and adapting to new tastes. Susan Chira, a deputy executive editor who helped lead an internal committee examining this issue, told me there are few more important priorities. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t do anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to have a broader audience to fund what we do.\u201dIf the plan is to engage a broader audience, then what is The Times doing to make that happen? I arrived only this past week, but from the conversations I\u2019ve had with the leadership and with the rank and file, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a long stretch of highway between the goal and present-day reality.Take reader comments on stories. This is arguably the most elemental way The Times can let its audience engage. Yet only about 10 percent of articles on any given day are open for comment. While an important effort is underway to improve that, its arrival has been hindered by various obstacles, including other newsroom priorities.And despite the need to pull the audience closer, only a relatively small number of newsroom staffers devote a portion of their day to reader concerns. Besides the comments team, there is the corrections desk, which often deals with readers. There is the letters editor, whose team engages with readers who trend older. There is the audience team, which among other key functions monitors user behavior on social platforms. And there is the office of the public editor, me as of last week, and my assistant, Evan Gershkovich. That\u2019s about it.Clearly, there is more to understanding readers than to literally have editors interact with them each day. Nonetheless, the small number of consumer-facing staffers is indicative of the bigger problem: a newsroom too distant from the people it serves.What The Times and most other newsrooms mostly do now is not so much listen to readers as watch and analyze them, like fish in a bowl. They view them in bulk, through statistics measuring how many millions of \u201cunique\u201d users clicked on content last month, or watched a video, or came to the site multiple times, or arrived through Facebook.What would prove more fruitful is for newsrooms to treat their audience like people with crucial information to convey \u2014 preferences, habits and shifting ways of consuming information. What do they like about what we do and how we do it? What do they want done differently? What do they turn to other sites for?Had we been listening more carefully and sooner, we would have known that our readers were using their phones for news while we were focused on monitors. And spending hours on social platforms before we had staffed \u201caudience teams\u201d to attract them. Or beginning to block ads while we were deploying \u201cpop-ups\u201d that took over user screens.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be a subscriber-based business there has to be a cultural change,\u201d French told me.One challenge will be to make changes to The Times that don\u2019t turn away current subscribers but that still attract prospective ones, especially millennials.Younger readers, for example, want to feel a sense of being close to the action. They want a dynamic relationship that feels more like a conversation between journalist and reader, and they welcome a little levity mixed into their news.The paper has already made some meaningful steps in this direction. But adapting to changing reader tastes may not be easy for The Times, a name synonymous with trust and quality, but also with stuffiness and a rather muzzled sense of humor. After all, it still clings to the use of courtesy titles before people\u2019s last names, an anachronism that may not track with the tastes of modern readers.In May, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, told the staff that the way The Times tells stories would be changing. \u201cFewer stories will be done just \u2018for the record,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, fewer traditional news stories will be done over all. Stories will relax in tone.\u201dThe audience committee is now taking what it has learned on the road, making the rounds through various departments of the newsroom. Success may require a gospel-style conversion to convince 1,300 journalists that what wasn\u2019t a priority in the print age is crucial now.I hope they are successful, as I am one of the converts. I no longer believe that listening to readers leads to dumbed-down journalism, if handled well. Think of pioneering comedians like Jon Stewart, arguably his own brand of journalist. He created a whole new genre of delivering the news. His incisive wit and brilliance enabled him to convey, in one entertaining spoof, what reams of reporters missed through more dutiful stories. The audience had a need, and Stewart found a way to fill it.I don\u2019t worry that The Times will go too far in incorporating reader ideas, nor do I think it will be careless in doing so. I worry that it won\u2019t go far enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cavity-Fighting Liquid Lets Kids Avoid Dentists\u2019 Drills", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byNobody looks forward to having a cavity drilled and filled by a dentist. Now there\u2019s an alternative: an antimicrobial liquid that can be brushed on cavities to stop tooth decay \u2014 painlessly.The liquid is called silver diamine fluoride, or S.D.F. It\u2019s been used for decades in Japan, but it\u2019s been available in the United States, under the brand name Advantage Arrest, for just about a year.\u201cThe upside, the great one, is you don\u2019t need to drill and you don\u2019t need an injection,\u201d said Dr. Margherita Fontana, a professor of cariology at the University of Michigan.Silver diamine fluoride is already used in hundreds of dental offices. Medicaid patients in Oregon are receiving the treatment, and at least 18 dental schools have started teaching the next generation of pediatric dentists how to use it.Dr. Richard Niederman, the chairman of the epidemiology and health promotion department at the New York University College of Dentistry, said, \u201cBeing able to paint it on in 30 seconds with no noise, no drilling, is better, faster, cheaper.\u201d\u201cI would encourage parents to ask for it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s less trauma for the kid.\u201dThe main downside is aesthetic: Silver diamine fluoride blackens the brownish decay on a tooth. That may not matter on a back molar or a baby tooth that will fall out, but some patients are likely to be deterred by the prospect of a dark spot on a visible tooth.Until more insurers cover it, patients also have to cover the cost. Still, it\u2019s relatively inexpensive. Dr. Michelle Urschel, an anesthesiologist, was happy to pay $25 to have Dr. Jeanette MacLean, a pediatric dentist in Glendale, Ariz., paint over a cavity that her son Knox, 4, had recently developed.A cavity that had to be drilled cost $151. The liquid \u201cwas very affordable,\u201d Dr. Urschel said.The noninvasive treatment may be ideal for the indigent, nursing home residents and others who have trouble finding care. And many anxious dental patients want to dodge the drill.Dr. Laurence Hyacinthe, a pediatric dentist in Harlem, used silver diamine fluoride on eight uncooperative children whose parents wanted to delay a trip to the operating room.Dr. MacLean said, \u201cPeople assume that parents will reject it because of poor aesthetics.\u201d But \u201cif it means preventing a child from having to be sedated or having their tooth drilled and filled, there are many parents who choose S.D.F.,\u201d she added.Two front teeth, however, were drilled. Next time, Ms. Bujeiro said, she\u2019d opt for silver diamine fluoride. \u201cI would use it in baby teeth even if it\u2019s in front,\u201d she said. As for the discoloration? \u201cYou can\u2019t see it too much.\u201dSilver diamine fluoride has another advantage over traditional treatment: It kills the bacteria that cause decay. A second treatment applied six to 18 months after the first markedly arrests cavities, studies have shown.\u201cS.D.F. reduces the incidence of new caries and progression of current caries by about 80 percent,\u201d said Dr. Niederman, who is updating an evidence review of silver diamine fluoride published in 2009.Fillings, by contrast, do not cure an oral infection.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that goes on in an operating room that treats the underlying problem,\u201d said Dr. Peter Milgrom, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Washington who was instrumental in receiving F.D.A. clearance for silver diamine fluoride and has a financial stake in Advantage Arrest.That\u2019s why some children must have dental treatment under anesthesia twice.\u201cYou need only a drop to treat five teeth, and it comes out to pennies per tooth,\u201d said Dr. Scott L. Tomar, a University of Florida dentistry professor who treats some Medicaid patients.Still, silver diamine fluoride is no silver bullet. Patients with mouth sores or a silver allergy can\u2019t use it. Severe cavities \u2014 huge holes that trap food and plaque \u2014 still require fillings.At dental conferences, Dr. Tomar and Dr. Fontana lecture about the treatment. They ask audiences if they are using it; so far, just a few hands go up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bangladeshi Troops Move to End Hostage Standoff", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladeshi Army troops moved in on Saturday to end an 11-hour standoff at a restaurant in Dhaka, the capital, after gunmen stormed into the building, detonated explosives and took at least 20 people hostage on Friday night.Gunfire and explosions could be heard as the soldiers, backed by armored vehicles, swept in to the restaurant in the city\u2019s diplomatic district at 7:40 a.m. on Saturday. At least a dozen people were rescued, including several foreigners, the police said.Two police officers were killed in the initial standoff with the attackers, and 30 people were wounded, mostly from shrapnel, officials said. A police inspector said that at least five militants had been killed in the rescue operation.Details about other fatalities or injuries from the attack or the rescue operation were not immediately available.The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday.\u201cIslamic State commandos attack a restaurant frequented by foreigners in the city of Dhaka in Bangladesh,\u201d reported Amaq, an information outlet linked to the Islamic State.Outside the restaurant, more than 200 people waited all night beyond the police cordon in the diplomatic enclave, dozens of them relatives and friends of the hostages. Some of them communicated by text message and social media with the hostages inside.Several kitchen employees who had locked themselves in a bathroom inside the restaurant, the Holey Artisan Bakery, posted a picture of themselves on Facebook, bare chested against the stifling heat.Soumir Roy, 28, one of the employees, messaged his brother, saying, \u201cWe are here so if possible break the wall of the bathroom and rescue us.\u201dBut after the gunfire and blasts from the rescue operations ceased, the messages from Mr. Roy stopped, and his brother and sister sat on the roadside weeping as they awaited news of whether he had survived. Ambulances could be seen leaving the scene.Eight to 10 armed men entered the restaurant, where about 20 foreigners were dining, around 8:45 p.m., according to Sumon Reza, a kitchen worker who escaped and spoke to reporters. The attackers shouted \u201cGod is great\u201d before opening fire and detonating several explosives, Mr. Reza said. He said the attackers were armed with pistols, swords and bombs.Amaq later reported, \u201cMore than 20 individuals of varying nationalities killed after a commando attack on the Artisan restaurant.\u201d There was no way to confirm that claim.Early on Saturday, the group posted photographs of what it said were the bodies of foreigners killed in the attack and claimed that it was holding hostages, Amaq said.The attack was the latest in a series of killings by Islamist extremists that have rocked Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country, in recent months. The Islamic State is known to have claimed responsibility for 18 other attacks in the last year, most perpetrated against religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians.The increase in violence has raised fears that the once-moderate country is in the grip of a wave of fanaticism that the government refuses to acknowledge. Despite months of attacks and subsequent claims of responsibility by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, the government \u2014 which recently concluded a crackdown on extremists in which 10,000 people were arrested \u2014 maintains that neither terrorist group has a presence in the country.\u201cThe continuous denial of the presence of local militant group connections with international terror groups has not been helpful,\u201d said Ali Riaz, a professor of political science at Illinois State University and an expert on South Asian politics. \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing can\u2019t be small groups coming together. It is clearly a very coordinated attack. If this doesn\u2019t convince them to come out of denial, then I don\u2019t know what will.\u201dAs gunfire and explosions rang out across the upscale Gulshan neighborhood on Friday, witnesses posted images on Twitter of paramilitary officers surrounding the Holey Artisan Bakery, which is popular with expatriates, diplomats and middle-class families.Several foreigners worked at the restaurant, including an Italian who escaped and an Argentine, whose whereabouts is unknown, the local news media reported.Mr. Reza, the kitchen worker, said he and another employee were able to escape by jumping from the building\u2019s second floor.The total number of hostages, including restaurant employees, was not known. Neither were the identities of the attackers.During the standoff, police erected a cordon around the restaurant, where family members of those inside gathered to await information. Fazley Rahim Khan, a businessman, waited on the edge of the police line, barely able to see the restaurant. He said he believed that his son Tahmid Hasib Khan, 22, was being held hostage.Mr. Khan said his son, a student in Canada, had just returned home on Friday for Ramadan. The family celebrated the iftar, the evening meal breaking the Ramadan fast, and then the son headed to the restaurant.\u201cI\u2019m just praying to get back my son,\u201d he said.At least two Sri Lankans were among the hostages, Hari Kesha Wijesekara, a former president of the Sri Lanka-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce, and his wife, Shyama, according to the group\u2019s current president, T.D. Packir.An Indian doctor, Sat Prakash, 43, who worked at a nearby clinic had been held hostage but escaped minutes before the army stormed the restaurant, said his friend Jahirul Islam Milton.Four diplomatic cars were parked outside the area all night. Foreign diplomats waiting to hear word of people inside refused to speak to reporters.The State Department advised Americans in the area to \u201cshelter in place and monitor news.\u201d\u201cThe situation\u2019s ongoing, obviously \u2014 too early for us to say who\u2019s involved, motivation, any of that stuff,\u201d said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman.Mr. Kirby said all Americans working for the United States Mission in Dhaka were safe, but officials were still trying to locate Bangladeshi employees.Julfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, Geeta Anand from New Delhi, and Russell Goldman from New York.

And I\u2019m sure the Finns would greatly appreciate getting it.\u201dThe straight line that marks the Finnish-Norwegian border in the area of Mount Halti \u2014 drawn in the mid-18th century \u2014 is \u201cgeophysically illogical,\u201d Mr. Harsson said.Geir Leiros, the mayor of Kafjord, a Norwegian community near the border, supports the hard-to-wrap gift. \u201cIt will cost us so little, nothing in fact, but I believe it would mean a lot to the Finns,\u201d he said.The potential border redrawing has been largely embraced in Finland, a proud if somewhat flat nation that had been part of the Russian Empire for more than a century, until Russia\u2019s two revolutions in 1917: one that overthrew the czarist regime and a second that established a Bolshevik republic that became the Soviet Union.\u201cThis would be the coolest thing ever,\u201d Harri Nieminen from Tampere, a city in southern Finland, wrote on the page.Mount Halti is the highest mountain in Finland, but its 4,478-foot summit is in Norway.Finland, which has a famously difficult Uralic language in which words with three umlauts are not uncommon, prides itself on the beauty of its forests and lakes, though Norway is better known for spectacular topography, including fjords, waterfalls and glaciers.Norway\u2019s highest peak, Galdhopiggen, has an elevation of 8,100 feet, making it nearly twice as high as Mount Halti, which is not even among the top 200 of Norway\u2019s highest peaks.Informed of the proposed gift, Anne Cathrine Frostrup, director-general of the Norwegian Mapping Authority, responded with generosity \u2014 if a bit of condescension. \u201cIt is a nice gift to give to a country that lacks a high mountain, where the highest point isn\u2019t even a peak,\u201d she said.\u201cI think it represents a colonial understanding, a conqueror mentality that I oppose,\u201d she said of the proposed transfer. \u201cI think it is absurd to think that you can give away something you don\u2019t own.\u201dShe added: \u201cHalti is situated in a Sami area, used by Sami on both sides of the mountains. The border was not drawn by Sami, and the borders have caused us nothing but problems. From a Sami perspective, the idea that a mountain can be owned by a state seems strange. To us, it would be better if there was no border at all.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf the mountain top becomes a new Finnish tourist attraction, I fear the possibility of a greater push for the construction of cabins, cafes and restaurants there.\u201dEven so, Mr. Majander allowed that most Finns might not notice the gift.\u201cWe consider Halti ours, in any case,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the peak is on the Norwegian side.\u201dMari-Leena Kuosa contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Micah Johnson, Gunman in Dallas, Honed Military Skills to a Deadly Conclusion", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byGARLAND, Tex. \u2014 There was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot. He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan.The Dallas police remained on edge Saturday. In the late afternoon, officers drew their weapons and cleared an area near the back of their headquarters after a report of a suspicious person in a department parking garage. The agency later said that no one had been found.In the past several days, as demonstrators jammed the streets in a number of American cities, protesting police violence, new details emerged about Mr. Johnson\u2019s life. They revealed a young man who had returned in disgrace from his stint abroad in the Army Reserve, but then continued a training regimen of his own devising, conducting military-style exercises in his backyard and reportedly joining a gym that offered martial arts and weapons classes.Although it did not seem to be a precise plan for Mr. Johnson\u2019s ambush, it was strikingly similar to the tactics he used.\u201cIt\u2019s talking not only about how to kill but how to keep from being killed,\u201d said Clay Jenkins, Dallas County\u2019s chief executive and director of homeland security and emergency management, who said he had not read the original journal but had reviewed summaries of it. \u201cIt shows that he\u2019s well prepared.\u201d\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBy definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you \u2014 strangers \u2014 you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I\u2019ll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents.\u201dOn Saturday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said in a statement that Mr. Obama had called him to offer condolences. Mr. Abbott said he had thanked the president and reiterated the need for Americans to unite after the shooting.Tensions remained high, however. In San Antonio, the police were investigating reports late Saturday that gunshots had been fired at their department\u2019s headquarters, Chief William McManus said at a briefing.Officers said that they heard gunshots hitting the building just before 10 p.m. and that \u201ca number of shell casings\u201d were recovered, Chief McManus said. There were no injuries.Mr. Johnson spent some of his childhood at the home of his father and stepmother in Garland, about a half-hour drive north of downtown Dallas. Their neighborhood, Camelot, is a collection of one- and two-story ranch-style houses of late-20th-century vintage, and their house is set in the middle of a tree-lined block, where a number of neighboring homes this weekend still displayed American flags from the Fourth of July weekend. The neighbors walking by or working on their lawns were black, white, Hispanic and Asian.Courtney Williams, 37, an electrician who lives in Forney, just east of Dallas, said he had known Mr. Johnson during his teenage days, when Mr. Johnson would stay with his mother in the Pleasant Grove area of Dallas. The two young men attended the same church, and Mr. Williams recalled Mr. Johnson as a \u201cwell-mannered\u201d youth who was active in church events and the typical pursuits of a teenager.\u201cVideo games, the whole nine yards,\u201d he said. Mr. Johnson showed no interest in weapons, Mr. Williams said.\u201cHe was just a quiet kid,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cNo attitude, no trouble with school. Just a normal kid.\u201dMr. Williams lost touch with Mr. Johnson after the younger man graduated from John Horn High School in Mesquite, Tex., where he had shown some interest in the military, going so far as to participate in the school\u2019s Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps program. He was not, it seemed on Saturday, a standout: Horn\u2019s former J.R.O.T.C. instructor said he had little recollection of Mr. Johnson.He enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2009 and was assigned to a unit \u2014 a component of the 420th Engineer Brigade \u2014 near Dallas. More than four years later, the unit deployed to Afghanistan. But before the soldiers left for the Afghan theater, they stood in formation not far from the streets where Mr. Johnson would someday stage a siege.An officer urged them to take care of their families and cultivate their faith. He also emphasized the importance of adapting on the fly.\u201cContinue to build the flexibility to adjust to changing and unforeseen situations faster than the enemy can adapt,\u201d the officer said, according to a video of the ceremony. \u201cThis is how we will succeed.\u201dBut Mr. Johnson did not succeed. While overseas, a female soldier in Mr. Johnson\u2019s unit accused him of sexual harassment. When the Army considered kicking him out, he waived his right to a hearing in exchange for a lesser charge.Soon he was back in Texas, living with his mother. Ron Price, 49, a former president of the Dallas school board, lives in Mesquite, about four blocks away. He used to see Mr. Johnson in the neighborhood and exchange hellos. He said he had noticed nothing really remarkable about him.\u201cHe was just another guy at the gas station,\u201d he said.But Mr. Jenkins said a neighbor had seen Mr. Johnson doing militarylike exercises in his backyard in Mesquite in the last couple of weeks.Mr. Johnson\u2019s preparations seemingly extended to visits to a \u201cself-defense and personal protection\u201d gym in the Dallas area.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, what he did,\u201d Mr. Everman told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted.\u201dIn addition to reading summaries of the journal, Mr. Jenkins said he had heard descriptions of its contents from other officials.Some of it was given over to very specific combat and sniper tactics, including details, Mr. Jenkins said, of \u201cwhat we call \u2018shoot and move\u2019 tactics \u2014 ways to fire on a target and then move quickly and get into position at another location to inflict more damage on targets without them being able to ascertain where the shots are coming from.\u201d This tactic is used by the military\u2019s special forces.\u201cWhen you couple \u2018shoot and move\u2019 and other tactics in his writings, his practice in the yard, his interest in weaponry, it seems to me that this was a well-prepared individual,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said.He added, \u201cIt appeared that he was an excellent marksman and was calmly shooting, as opposed to someone who\u2019s just holding a gun up and aiming it and pulling the trigger in the direction of where they think people are.\u201dMr. Jenkins said Mr. Johnson had used a semiautomatic SKS rifle and a high-capacity handgun. He drove his vehicle to the demonstration and parked it, Mr. Jenkins said, but was on foot at many points throughout the attack.Mr. Johnson\u2019s knowledge of \u201cshoot and move\u201d \u2014 and the fact that a few of the protesters in the crowd who were not involved in the shooting were armed and carrying rifles \u2014 has helped shed light on how a theory of multiple assailants emerged.In Texas, gun owners can legally and openly carry what are known as long guns, including shotguns and rifles. The carrying of handguns is regulated in Texas and requires a state-issued permit, whether concealed or openly carried, but the carrying of rifles is largely unregulated and requires no permit. The so-called open carrying of rifles has become common at many demonstrations in Texas in recent years.\u201cWhen the shooting first happened, you had people in the crowd who were carrying long rifles and dressed in camouflage,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cAnd then the shooting happens, and those people begin to disperse and move quickly, and they have guns and they\u2019re not police officers and there\u2019s a shooting, and so one of the things that people would investigate quickly is did they have anything to do with whatever is happening.\u201dMr. Jenkins said that Mr. Johnson did not appear to have advance knowledge of the march route. Parts of the route were determined on the spot without planning, Mr. Jenkins said.Throughout a sweltering Saturday, a section of downtown Dallas remained a closed-off crime scene as investigators faced a second day of piecing together the details of the attack, an inquiry that had included more than 200 interviews. More than 20 square blocks remained cordoned off.Two squad cars outside Police Headquarters have become memorials, covered in flowers, balloons, posters and handwritten notes. On Friday evening, before the officers went on heightened alert, person after person slowly and quietly approached the cars to add tributes. A Dallas police sergeant wiped her eyes, and a handful of people gathered in a circle to pray.Similar moments played out on Saturday. \u201cI miss you already Brother, but you are home with the angels now,\u201d said a note about Officer Brent Thompson. The authors wrote, \u201cYou were, are, and always will be our hero.\u201dAs Mayor Mike Rawlings visited Police Headquarters on Saturday, he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re all human here, and I think that people feel each other\u2019s pain. And that\u2019s what makes it great, that\u2019s what makes you hopeful that we can do this, that we can move from senselessness, absurdity that\u2019s like a Camus novel, to something that has redemption and hope in it. And that\u2019s ultimately what we need to do.\u201dHe stopped to speak with a woman kneeling by one police car and told her, \u201cPray hard, sister.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Garland, and Manny Fernandez and Alan Blinder from Dallas.

In public appearances, he said, he deliberately avoids commentary on contemporary politics.\u201cVery often, during question-and-answer sessions, people ask me some question about the president or other would-be candidates,\u201d he said in an interview this week. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018My specialty is dead politicians.\u2019 In that way, I could sidestep the question without getting myself involved.\u201cBut this time around, I don\u2019t feel that way any more.\u201dIt is a diverse, honored group \u2014 including, among others, Robert A. Caro, Ron Chernow, David Levering Lewis, William E. Leuchtenburg, Vicki Lynn Ruiz \u2014 that speaks with alarm about Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and his place in the march of American history.Mr. McCullough, raised in a Republican home and now aligned with no party, said the prospect of a Trump presidency so distressed him that he felt he could not remain publicly detached. \u201cWhen you think of how far we have come, and at what cost, and with what faith, to just turn it all over to this monstrous clown with a monstrous ego, with no experience, never served his country in any way \u2014 it\u2019s just crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stand by and let it happen. The Republican Party shouldn\u2019t stand by and let it happen.\u201d\u201cI should say, I\u2019m a registered independent,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m strongly in favor of a number of Republicans both past and in our own time. It\u2019s not as though I\u2019m doing this from lifelong ideology against Republicans. By no means.\u201dThe videos are mostly homemade, smartphone productions. None of the historians asked to weigh in have declined, Mr. Burns said.Like many of the others, Mr. Burns said he heard echoes of dangerous populist demagogues in Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Among the issues that were cited were his calls to ban all Muslims, his characterization of many Mexicans as criminals and his mockery of veterans and people with disabilities. Mr. Trump has said that the country faces crises that require strong action to protect its borders, and that his role as an outsider has cost him the approval of elites and entrenched interests, including in his own party.\u201cPlaying with hate has had tragic consequences throughout our history,\u201d she said.Mr. Lewis, a professor at New York University and biographer of W. E. B. DuBois, recalled Wendell Willkie, a presidential candidate with a superficial resemblance to Mr. Trump, in that he was a wealthy businessman who had held no prior electoral office and became a Republican just shortly before the 1940 campaign against Roosevelt. But after the election, Willkie distinguished himself by calling for a loyal opposition, Professor Lewis said. (Willkie served as Roosevelt\u2019s informal emissary to Britain, in a sign of bipartisanship.) \u201cFor Donald Trump, Willkie\u2019s loyal opposition concept is surely anathema,\u201d Professor Lewis said.Mr. Leuchtenburg, a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a leading scholar of the American presidency, said Mr. Trump was essentially ahistorical. \u201cHe has no sense of the American past,\u201d Professor Leuchtenburg said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the achievements of this country.\u201dThe About New York column on Wednesday, about historians who banded together to express alarm over Donald J.

Yahoo is 21 years old, and for more than half its life people have wondered if the company could get the magic back. More than anything, that is a mark of the good will Silicon Valley long held for the company, and its seemingly boyish founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo.For many, not least shareholders, Yahoo would have been better off taking Microsoft\u2019s $44.6 billion bid in 2008, which is almost $50 billion in today\u2019s money. The company is now valued at $35 billion, and the figure is that high only because in February Yahoo decided to sell its core assets (around the same time it announced a big layoff).When so much has gone wrong to something once so seemingly wonderful, one ascribes bad luck, and bad management. When it happens over so many years, under so many different leaders, however, it\u2019s also worth asking whether there wasn\u2019t also some flaw of character, or what in corporate terms is called culture.The Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs reportedly told Yahoo early in the millennium that it had to decide whether it was a tech company or a content company. This was a sensible and profound point, and something Yahoo never accomplished.That may be because content and tech were always contending at Yahoo. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo, two engineers, started out by pointing out cool sites on the young World Wide Web. Human taste, meet high tech.Tim Koogle, the company\u2019s first chief executive, was a mechanical engineer, and was succeeded by Terry Semel, a Hollywood guy who bragged that he didn\u2019t use email. Thereafter, \u201cWhat are we?\u201d was a question Yahoo\u2019s leaders seemed to be perpetually addressing.Human curators at Yahoo, eventually an entire building full of them, tried to apply taste and by-hand content organization of the web even as the web exploded. The two companies Yahoo most famously missed buying \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 were far more successful bypassing human organization, and finding algorithms that worked on things like page links and social posts.If you had to choose between tech and content, clearly tech was the superior way to go (if for no other reason than there was no great content company in Silicon Valley). But that implies that Yahoo could have chosen.Maybe Mr. Jobs was wrong, inasmuch as Yahoo couldn\u2019t actually make the kind of choice he demanded of it. It was always a bit of both things, and seems to have collapsed under this, and many other contradictions.Advertisement"}

She also suggested that he had a permit to legally carry a gun.\u201cPlease, officer, don\u2019t tell me that you just did this to him,\u201d Ms. Reynolds said in the video, which quickly gained international attention. \u201cYou shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.\u201dIn the video, Ms. Reynolds said her boyfriend was stopped for a broken taillight. Mr. Kelly said there was \u201cmore than the reason for the equipment violation\u201d to pull Mr. Castile over, but would not specify what those other reasons might have been.The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the case, has released few details. The bureau has confirmed that the episode started as a traffic stop by Officer Yanez and a colleague near the state fairgrounds in Falcon Heights, a suburb patrolled by the St. Anthony Police Department. Mr. Castile died at a hospital shortly after the shooting. The bureau said a weapon was recovered at the scene.Gov. Mark Dayton, who has met with protesters and black leaders, has expressed sympathy for the Castile family and concerns about the role of race in the shooting, infuriating some in law enforcement.\u201cWould this have happened if those passengers \u2014 the driver and the passengers \u2014 were white?\u201d Mr. Dayton asked on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve.\u201dProtesters have gathered outside the governor\u2019s residence in St. Paul since shortly after the shooting, and many have framed it as yet another episode of a black man being unjustly gunned down by a police officer.On Friday night, a sizable, racially diverse crowd gathered outside the governor\u2019s mansion, where they had decorated the street with chalk messages like \u201cThis needs to end!\u201d and \u201cJustice 4 MN.\u201dThe Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has provided no timeline for when its investigation would be finished, though many expect it to take weeks or months.At that point, the case will go to the Ramsey County prosecutor, who can either decide on charges himself or present the evidence to a grand jury.Mr. Kelly said Officer Yanez had cooperated with investigators, providing informal information immediately after the shooting and giving a full statement within about 15 hours.\u201cHe\u2019s very distressed about this incident, and he feels badly for the family of Philando Castile,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic incident.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Homeless Teenager\u2019s Viral Story Caused a Battle Over GoFundMe Money", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byWhen a homeless teenager named Fred Barley rode a bicycle some 50 miles into Barnesville, Ga., this month, he set up a small tent in a clump of bushes near Gordon State College, where he had registered. When two police officers found him, he told them he wanted to get a job before classes started.Two police officers checked the 19-year-old into the Sun Inn nearby for a couple of nights, paying out of their own pockets, the motel\u2019s owner, Ansuya Pandya, said in an interview. That good deed caught the attention of another resident, Casey Blaney, who fired up a GoFundMe page and paid to extend Mr. Barley\u2019s stay.Then, Ms. Blaney abruptly halted fund-raising last week. The pendulum of social media support had swung back to skepticism and suspicions about where the money was going. Now, weeks after the story began, it has devolved into a cautionary tale about the nature of online fund-raising and the perils of being a good Samaritan in the digital age.Two weeks after Mr. Barley came to Barnesville, he has gone into hiding after being accused of taking the money and running, even though no funds have been dispersed from the campaign. Ms. Blaney is lying low, as well, after being accused of also taking the money. She is speaking only through a lawyer, Wright Gammon, who did not answer phone and email requests for comment on Monday.She also told of the toll of handling the campaign, writing, \u201cI am a wife and a mother and cannot continue to handle the multitude of calls, texts, social media requests and comments.\u201dOn Tuesday, GoFundMe said in a statement: \u201cWe are working with both Fred and Casey on the transfer of funds. The funds won\u2019t be transferred to a trust until all parties come to an agreement. Over all, it\u2019s important to remember that the money will go directly to Fred\u2019s education.\u201dThe episode has divided residents of Barnesville, a small town of 6,500 in Lamar County where rumors tend to spread fast online, according to Debbie Adamson, the owner of DB\u2019s Pizzeria, who said she had reached out to Mr. Barley with a job offer.He worked at the pizzeria for a week and a half as a dishwasher and a pizza-making trainee before telling Ms. Adamson about an offer for free tuition at another college in Alabama. He later called saying that the offer didn\u2019t pan out, and Ms. Adamson has not heard from him since Friday, she said.\u201cRight now he has more or less gone into hiding mode,\u201d Ms. Adamson, 53, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cNo one has seen or heard from him. He\u2019s a 19-year-old kid. He\u2019s overwhelmed.\u201dIt is unclear if Mr. Barley will meet his original goal of attending Gordon State.

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 For more than a decade, Silicon Valley\u2019s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie.Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a \u201cLike\u201d button.The shift was evident in a Lowe\u2019s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries.The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.Silicon Valley\u2019s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing self-driving cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a half-dozen types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized.\u201cWe saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom \u2014 there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,\u201d said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco.Funding in A.I. start-ups has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1.2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year.\u201cWhenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,\u201d said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. \u201cBut you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don\u2019t happen every day.\u201dSilicon Valley\u2019s new A.I. era underscores the region\u2019s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend.\u201cThis is at the heart of the region\u2019s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. \u201cThe valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning.\u201dThe change spurred a rush for talent in A.I. that has become intense.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. \u201cThe number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy.\u201dThe valley\u2019s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region\u2019s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a consumer-electronics manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the mid-1970s. A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet.A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would \u2014 for at least another generation \u2014 remain the world\u2019s innovation center.How far the A.I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today\u2019s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have human-level intelligence.Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A.I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of start-ups. Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the \u201cA.I. Winter.\u201dThe current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong.\u201cThere is no chance of a new winter,\u201d said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence start-ups.John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A.I. companies. \u201cYou get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,\u201d he said.For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A.I. companies in the 1980s \u2014 Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down \u2014 the Valley\u2019s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered.\u201cSometimes when I hang around with A.I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

At 10:53 p.m., the Dallas Police Department posted a Twitter message announcing that 10 officers had been shot during a protest rally, three of them fatally. Twenty minutes later, a second message said that a fourth officer had been killed. Then, after midnight, there was a third: \u201cIt has been a devastating night. We are sad to report a fifth officer has died.\u201dBy Friday afternoon, the full scope of the city\u2019s losses was clear: At least two of the slain officers had served overseas in the military, only to die back home in Texas. A third had made his way to Dallas after working at a jail outside Detroit. A fourth was a large man \u2014 about 6-foot-5 \u2014 who had the semblance of a grizzly bear, according to a friend. The fifth was a standout on Dallas\u2019s large, modern force: The local police association had named him the \u201cCops\u2019 Cop\u201d for February 2009.As condolences for the men poured in all day on Friday \u2014 from the governor to the secretary general of the United Nations \u2014 details of the officers\u2019 lives started to emerge. \u201cWe\u2019re hurting, our profession is hurting,\u201d said David O. Brown, the Dallas police chief.The first officer to be identified was Brent Thompson, 43, who worked for the police force of Dallas Area Rapid Transit, which operates trains and buses in the region. Mr. Thompson, the first DART officer to die in the line of duty, joined the transit force in 2009 and patrolled the northwestern section of the transit system, according to his LinkedIn page.Before Dallas, he worked for DynCorp International as a police liaison officer and helped train fellow officers in Afghanistan and Iraq. He had also been a police academy instructor in Corsicana, Tex., southeast of Dallas, where he attended high school.He started in law enforcement in the Navarro County sheriff\u2019s office, where he was assigned to the county jail, said Leslie A. Cotten Sr., the former sheriff. But like most young officers, Mr. Cotten said, \u201che wanted to get out on patrol and ride around in a patrol car and do a different job.\u201dFamily members, writing on Facebook, were the first to publicly identify Mr. Zamarripa, a seven-year veteran of the Dallas force who had spent time in the Navy and served tours in Iraq as a military policeman. His Navy records released on Friday showed that he enlisted in 2001 and had also been posted in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Virginia and Bahrain.When he finished his military service, Mr. Zamarripa, a fan of the Rangers and the Dallas Cowboys, returned to the Dallas area and joined the Police Department, said his uncle, Hector Zamarripa. He lived in the Fort Worth area with Ms. Villasenor and their 2-year-old daughter, Lyncoln. He also had a stepson, his uncle said.On Friday afternoon, the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization \u2014 Mr. Zamarripa was a member \u2014 held a somber lunch for grieving supporters.\u201cA good kid, man, a good young kid,\u201d said Sgt. George Aranda, who runs the organization. \u201cHe loved his job. I talked to his mom last night, and even his mom said this was Patrick\u2019s dream. This is what he wanted to be, a police officer.\u201dThe third slain officer was Michael Krol, 40. Before moving to Dallas, Mr. Krol had served in the Wayne County, Mich., jail system from 2003 to 2007, said the county sheriff, Benny N. Napoleon. Two of Mr. Krol\u2019s relatives declined to be interviewed on Friday.A fourth officer, Lorne Ahrens, was married to a Dallas police detective and regarded as a lawman devoted to the profession that he pursued in Dallas for more than a dozen years.\u201cThere are very few officers I\u2019ve met who are more passionate about doing the job right than that man,\u201d said Timothy S. Rodgers, a former prosecutor in Dallas County. \u201cHe was always calling me. He always had questions like, \u2018What can I do better in this situation?\u2019 \u201dMr. Ahrens had worked in patrol and on property crimes. Mr. Rodgers recalled with a chuckle that his friend had a knack for finding criminals who would challenge him, despite his hefty size.The fifth slain officer was Michael J. Smith, who joined the Police Department in September 1989 after growing up in the southeastern corner of the state. In a publication acknowledging his Cops\u2019 Cop award, the Police Association said that Mr. Smith held an array of posts: in personnel, on patrol and at the airport. The publication also said he had been injured on duty years ago when a gang member \u201clunged at his partner with an unknown object in his hand.\u201dAt a news conference on Friday morning, Mayor Mike Rawlings stood beside Chief Brown and said: \u201cTo say that our police officers put their lives on the line every day is no hyperbole, ladies and gentlemen. It\u2019s a reality.\u201dA few hours earlier, the department had posted yet another Twitter message: \u201cThank you to the members of our community for your show of support during this difficult time.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Dallas, and Alan Feuer from New York.

{"Headline": "Terrorist or Disturbed Loner? Munich Attack Reveals Shifting Labels", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 Munich\u2019s police chief, Hubertus Andr\u00e4, the morning after a gunman killed nine people and then himself, offered two pieces of information that seemed at odds.Information about Mr. Sonboly is still emerging. But regardless of what details surface, Chief Andr\u00e4\u2019s classification of the attack \u2014 as potentially inspired by a famous terrorist attack, yet not terrorism itself \u2014 reflects more than the increasingly blurry line between mass assailant and terrorist.It also highlights that this line is often drawn differently depending on the attacker\u2019s apparent ideology.This has fed concerns by civil rights groups and Muslim organizations, in Europe and the United States, that there is a lower bar for labeling something as terrorism when it can be linked to Islam. This tendency, they warn, feeds into anti-Muslim sentiment at a time when far-right populist movements are calling for special restrictions on Muslims.The Islamic State has contributed to the blurring of this line. Because it encourages individuals to act alone, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate an attacker acting on behalf of the group from one who is merely grasping for justification to commit violence. The group benefits from this uncertainty, playing up claims of responsibility to better terrorize faraway communities that it might otherwise strain to reach.But nonjihadist ideologies, though they might receive less scrutiny, are also capable of inspiring violence.At a time when terrorism is a major issue in Western politics, defining something as terrorism is not just a matter of determining motive. It is a political statement in itself.This spoke to the significance of labeling something as terrorism, which implies that the attack represents a larger threat \u2014 and thus compels action against that threat.This is why many Republicans have criticized President Obama for, they say, being too slow to label an attack as terrorism, which they see as an excuse to avoid action.But it is also why Muslim and civil rights groups worry that lone madmen are more likely to be termed terrorists if they are Muslim, which they say encourages fear and suspicion of Muslims. Anti-Muslim attacks are rising in the United States and Europe, highlighting the consequences of that fear.Political scientists define terrorism as violence committed to further a political agenda. When an individual acts alone, and particularly if that individual has both a troubled background and a record of consuming extremist material online, it can be difficult to determine whether an attack fits that definition.As those classifications have become more politically charged, they are increasingly treated as a strict binary: Something is considered terrorism or not terrorism. But this often obscures more than it reveals, reducing the complex drivers of mass violence to a simple matter of black and white.In truth, terrorism analysts say, there is no hard distinction between an individual who commits violence for a political cause and one who is driven by his own demons.That is a difficult truth to take on, because it requires acknowledging a high degree of uncertainty about who is a potential threat and how to prevent attacks. But resisting this realization can lead to some odd moments \u2014 such as suggesting that the attack in Munich may have been inspired by one of Europe\u2019s most famous terrorists and yet not constitute an act of terrorism itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Disturbia", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byCLEVELAND \u2014 LIKE any masterly comic book villain, Donald Trump is reveling in conjuring a dystopia. And it\u2019s a natural progression, given that he got this far by reveling in conjuring a diss-topia.Both of his barbed-wire universes were on display here last week.Trump did not slay a dragon in the way that presidential contenders did in the old days with laurels from the battlefield. In his mythmaking, he slayed 16 dragons on the debate stage.Ivanka offered her father\u2019s hero-myth at the beginning of her convention speech Thursday night: \u201cHe prevailed against a field of 16 very talented competitors.\u201dAnd how did the political tyro accomplish this seemingly impossible feat?He dissed all of them, death by a thousand cuts. Jeb Bush was \u201ca one-day kill,\u201d as a gloating Trump put it, with the \u201clow energy\u201d taunt. \u201cLiddle Marco\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d bit the dust. \u201cOne-for-38 Kasich\u201d fell by the wayside.Trump bragged on it again Friday morning when he met with his convention volunteers here before flying off on Trump Force One.\u201cNo matter what your feelings, whether you\u2019re the governor of Ohio, whether you\u2019re a senator from Texas, or any of the other people that I beat so easily and so badly, you have no choice,\u201d he crowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go for Trump.\u201dAnd on the distaff side, we are bound to hear more about \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and \u201cPocahontas\u201d as the ladies celebrate making history in Philly this week.There is a brutality and harshness about Trump\u2019s two worlds: feral insults that \u201ckill\u201d opponents and a convention so feral that Politico\u2019s Glenn Thrush said he expected to see wild cats wandering through it.On Thursday night, the nominee painted a crepuscular \u201cMidnight in America\u201d picture of the \u201cdeath, destruction, terrorism and weakness\u201d that he claimed President Obama and Hillary had wrought. \u201cOur convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAny politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\u201dAmerica is a disaster but Trump will descend from his gilded skyscraper and sacrifice himself and move to a mere six-story white home to save us.Ronald Reagan put a charming, smiling face on harsh policies. W. was a genial candidate who gave no hint of the doom to come. But Donald Trump doesn\u2019t sugarcoat it. Take him or face dissolution.Trump told the crowd that he was presenting the facts \u201cplainly and honestly.\u201d But his dystopia is fueled by diss-information and diss-tortion, insulting rivals with disturbing exaggerated and cherry-picked facts and unsubstantiated assertions and conspiracies.The president has put himself forward as the Trump Fact-Checker in Chief. At a joint press conference Friday at the White House with the president of Mexico, Obama pushed back on the Republican nominee he disdains.\u201cThis idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn\u2019t really jibe with the experience of most people,\u201d the president said.He added: \u201cWhen it comes to crime, the violent crime rate in America has been lower during my presidency than any time in the last three, four decades. And although it is true that we\u2019ve seen an uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities this year, the fact of the matter is, is that the murder rate today, the violence rate today, is far lower than it was when Ronald Reagan was president \u2014 and lower than when I took office.\u201dThe rate of killings of police officers is also much lower since the Reagan years, he said. \u201cThose are facts. That\u2019s the data.\u201dNothing should be remarkable with Trump anymore. But it was still remarkable to see him the morning after his balloon-drop coronation as head of the Republican Party return to trolling Ted Cruz. There\u2019s a dissonance in his bleak dystopia and his brash diss-topia as he switches from Dr. Strangelove to Don Rickles.At their meeting with volunteers, a bemused and wary Mike Pence stood behind Trump, looking at him as if he were a big bottle of nitroglycerin. Trump gleefully got back to diss-topia, dissing Cruz because Cruz dissed him \u2014 follow along, readers \u2014 by not giving an endorsement in his prime-time speech Wednesday.\u201cAll I did,\u201d Trump said disingenuously, talking about Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, \u201cis point out the fact that on the cover of The National Enquirer, there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast.\u201dActually, the picture was of Oswald passing out leaflets about Cuba with a man the tabloid was alleging, through some kind of photo analysis, was Rafael.Trump said The Enquirer, owned by a friend of his, should be \u201cvery respected\u201d and should have won a Pulitzer for breaking the John Edwards love child story.As Pence looked on with smiling trepidation, Trump asked him if he could set up a \u201csuper PAC\u201d while he was serving as president to destroy Ted Cruz but didn\u2019t wait for an answer.He then went on to review the whole story again about the diss to Melania, when her \u201crisqu\u00e9\u201d photo in GQ \u2014 \u201ca reasonably respected magazine,\u201d he called it \u2014 was run in an ad on Facebook by an anti-Trump super PAC and Trump responded by retweeting an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz.He called Heidi \u201ca very nice woman and a very beautiful woman\u201d and \u201cthe best thing he\u2019s got going, and his kids, if you want to know the truth.\u201d After more along these lines, he finished with, \u201cSo that takes care of the Heidi thing.\u201dThe truth is out there, Donald.Advertisement"}

PAUL \u2014 Demonstrators angered by the fatal police shooting of a black man during a suburban traffic stop kept vigil outside the governor\u2019s mansion here Friday as officials urged calm and more details emerged about the officer who fired the shots.Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who was placed on administrative leave after the killing on Wednesday night of the driver, Philando Castile, was a member of the St. Anthony police for four years. He had earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in law enforcement in 2010 and was honored by his college as a top student. In the years since graduating, he had posted online about a wedding and the birth of a child and settled into a suburban neighborhood.\u201cHe always wanted to dig deeper \u2014 what if this happened, or that happened,\u201d said Christian Dobratz, one of Officer Yanez\u2019s professors at Minnesota State University, Mankato. \u201cI knew he was very big on wanting to work with others and serving a community,\u201d he added.But even as Officer Yanez\u2019s background became clearer, the specifics of the shooting that left Mr. Castile dead remained murky.As that footage went viral online, protests have continued almost nonstop in St. Paul and the surrounding area, with activists calling for charges against Officer Yanez and a separate, federal investigation.In Falcon Heights, the suburb where Mr. Castile was shot, a group of university students and employees marched to the shooting scene to pay tribute Friday afternoon. And at the governor\u2019s residence in a residential area of St. Paul, demonstrators continued to mingle outside the gates. The protests have been large, spirited and almost entirely peaceful, though one person was arrested and a police car was damaged early Friday near Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s home when demonstrations turned tense.So far, Justice Department officials have said they were monitoring the state investigation, but have not announced their own inquiry. John J. Choi, the prosecutor in Ramsey County, said he had urged the state agency investigating to be prompt and thorough, but did not offer a timeline on when a charging decision might be made.Mr. Choi, whose office will decide whether to bring charges, said he was unsure whether he would present the evidence to a grand jury or make the charging decision himself. Mr. Choi historically has used grand juries in police shooting cases and said he saw benefits in doing so, but that he would consider whether that was the right approach for Mr. Castile\u2019s case.\u201cI just need a little time and thought put into it,\u201d Mr. Choi said at a news conference at his downtown office. \u201cI think this is a very extraordinary case.\u201dIf Mr. Choi opts to decide on charges himself, rather than presenting the case to grand jurors, he would be following his colleague in neighboring Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. The prosecutor there, who also had long used grand juries for police shootings, changed his policy and decided himself to not charge the Minneapolis officers involved in last year\u2019s fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, another case that prompted widespread protests in this area.Governor Dayton, a Democrat, who angered some in law enforcement Thursday by saying he thought Mr. Castile probably would not have been shot if he were white, said Friday that he was standing by those comments.Mr. Dayton, who has at times mingled with the protesters outside his home, said he appreciated the demonstrators\u2019 peaceful tone. On Friday, he said he planned to meet with African-American pastors and civic leaders in the coming days, and called for people to \u201creact nonviolently.\u201d\u201cI make an appeal to everyone in Minnesota for calm, for understanding of this difficult time and the need for calm and nonviolence,\u201d said Mr. Dayton, who also spoke of a shooting in Minneapolis on Friday that left a toddler dead. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this terrible time here in Minnesota if we can all recognize that and not take any actions that are going to exacerbate a very difficult situation.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

Or was this just a break in the chaos?\u201cI was up most of last night,\u201d said Christal Washington, the wife of a Louisiana state police officer, \u201clooking at Facebook, making sure nobody has posted that there is another attack. Watching the news. You try not to intensely focus on it. But I would go and I would do something. And then I would check my phone.\u201dTaken together, the events have reflected and heightened racial tension across the country.At the Rock Church in the suburb of Zachary, Ms. Washington, who is white, stood next to her husband, Officer Patrick Washington, who is black. They were joined by a mixed-race congregation that included about a dozen other officers, as well as their two children.Under a canopy of gold lights, police officers lined up for handshakes and hugs. An assistant pastor named George Rodriguez offered words of encouragement. \u201cSpiritually, we have your back,\u201d he told the officers. \u201cWe\u2019re praying for you.\u201dAfterward, tears spilled down the cheeks of Payton Washington, 16, who said she missed the days when she was not afraid her father would be targeted for his uniform. \u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t have to worry that somebody was just going to see my dad and just hate him without knowing him,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about that whenever they say, \u2018Let\u2019s start killing cops.\u2019 But it\u2019s not all bad cops.\u201dThirty-five miles to the south, hundreds of people gathered outside Healing Place Church, a big, modern house of worship for an intense, impromptu service to honor Matthew Gerald, a 41-year-old military veteran who died in the shooting, less than a year after joining the Baton Rouge Police Department.Mourners held candles aloft in cups under a fading pastel sky. They prayed not only for Mr. Gerald, but for Montrell L. Jackson, 32, whose child turned 4 months old on Monday, and for Brad Garafola, 45, a sheriff\u2019s deputy and father of four.The mourners listened to a succession of pastors tell them to trust in Jesus, and they stood silently as a man with a guitar sang about the perils of police work.Dexter Havens, 39, said that he always took his son to the same center to play laser tag, where they would see Mr. Jackson in the parking lot. Mr. Havens\u2019s son, who is 6, wants to be a police officer, and he was thrilled when Mr. Jackson would roll down the window of his squad car and say hello.He said his son had recognized Mr. Jackson while watching a news report of the tragedy on television. Mr. Havens did not know how to respond. \u201cI just told him he\u2019s in heaven, and that he\u2019s in a better place,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I just came here.\u201dMost of those who attended the service were white. But not all. Darin Fontenette, the president of a youth sports group who is African-American, said he was as pained by the officers\u2019 deaths as he was by the earlier police killing here of a black man, Alton B. Sterling, on July 5.\u201cI\u2019m protesting on both sides,\u201d Mr. Fontenette said. \u201cI\u2019m here because all lives matter.\u201dAt St. Thomas More Catholic Church, roughly 80 people came for a scriptural rosary dedicated to the dead officers. Outside, on the pristinely manicured church lawn, Garrett Doucet, a parishioner and organizer of the vigil, welcomed people inside.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply saddening,\u201d he said of the shootings. \u201cWe\u2019re at a place where we worked for years not to be.\u201dJulie Bloom and Richard Fausset contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and the Limits of the Improv Campaign", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byAbroad in AmericaAbroad in America, written by a Times foreign correspondent, approaches the election in much the same way as we would events overseas, deciphering the action for a global audience.CLEVELAND \u2014 The balloon drop, at least, went well for Donald J. Trump \u2014 a glorious cascade of color, released from the rafters, that flittered around the beaming billionaire after he was confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee in an arena packed with roaring supporters on Thursday night. Earlier in this convention week, though, little seemed to be going to plan.On Day 1, Mr. Trump\u2019s supermodel wife, Melania, became entangled in a plagiarism scandal after it emerged that part of her speech had been copied from one given by Michelle Obama. Two days later, one of his vanquished rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, caused consternation with a defiant speech in which he refused to endorse Mr. Trump.There was an embarrassing, if short-lived, attempt by anti-Trump Republicans to block his nomination. Party delegates booed some speakers, and deserted the hall when others were still on stage. Mr. Trump himself disrupted any semblance of message discipline, appearing on Fox News one evening during the proceedings, which led to split-screen dizziness, and giving a foreign-policy interview in which he made several startling statements.As the surprises tripped one into another, providing rich fodder for the 15,000 journalists who had flooded into Cleveland, it seemed that Mr. Trump had approached the convention in the same seat-of-his-pants manner that served him so well in the Republican primary elections this spring, when he steadily dispatched a field of 16 opponents.While political pundits spent much of the week tsk-tsk\u2019ing the Trump team for lacking control of the conclave, they have been proven wrong over and over in this unconventional year, in which the former reality television star not only threw out the old playbook but also seems to be operating without a playbook at all.Mr. Trump\u2019s thunderous and fear-laden acceptance speech Thursday night got a roaring welcome in the convention hall, but the chaos of the past week renewed broader questions about the haphazard and deeply self-involved style that assured his stunning success up to now. Among some Republicans, it has reinforced doubts about whether Mr. Trump, who has built his campaign around whim and impulse, can now harness that into a viable force to beat the Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, in November \u2014 and to run the most powerful country on earth.\u201cYou look at that, and the conclusion you come to is that this is not a serious endeavor to elect someone president,\u201d Stuart Stevens, who was the chief strategist to the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, said of the convention. \u201cIt\u2019s just about ego.\u201dEvery twist of Cleveland crazy was fed into the instant grinder of social media and news websites, obscuring the messages from the podium to the party faithful: testimonials from Mr. Trump\u2019s wife and children to soften his often belligerent persona; rallying calls to unify his bitterly divided party; and the elevation of his gentle-mannered running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana.Modern American political conventions have not been like this. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, they could be dramatic affairs, with openly fought political battles, back-room deals and violent clashes between protesters and the police.But in recent decades, they have evolved into polished, meticulously scripted events whose main purpose is to serve as an extended infomercial on prime-time television. Over four days, the particular party rolls out its election message, unifies behind its anointed candidate, seeds attacks against the other side, and steels itself for the battle ahead.For Mr. Trump, Cleveland offered a golden opportunity for him to counter his many critics by projecting a presidential air and trying to broaden his largely white support base. Thousands of journalists set up temporary bases inside a vast, hangar-like hall that was divided by blue curtains, giving it the air of a labyrinthine changing room. Television studios and social media companies like Facebook and Twitter hired out local restaurants to serve as studios or hospitality suites.Mr. Trump appeared to be far less organized. He applied himself to the convention just a few weeks before it started. Many decisions were entrusted to his adult children, which slowed up the process. He struggled to assemble a roster of celebrity speakers to speak in his favor. (The eventual list included several 80s-era soap opera stars, a little-known businessman and a former underwear model.)The improvised nature of some preparations showed during the convention, in gaffes such as the failure to vet the speeches for plagiarism \u2014 a common precaution before any major political event. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, appeared reluctant to share the limelight, appearing on the convention stage on three nights, instead of the normal one.As ever, for the media, he was ratings gold. \u201cIt has been chaotic,\u201d Jake Tapper, the CNN host, said in an interview. \u201cThe language was sometimes strong. There\u2019s been controversy, then more controversy. And it\u2019s been exciting.\u201dMaybe that was part of the playbook after all. In a sense, it is business as usual for Mr. Trump, a New York real estate mogul whose improbable political career was kick-started by a stint in reality television, and who during the primaries kept himself in the headlines with a stream of vulgarities and provocations that would have torpedoed the careers of other politicians.No matter how many times Mr. Trump issued boyish insults against other candidates, or faced newspaper stories that exposed his business dealings, his sexism or his distortions (something Mr. Trump has euphemistically called \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d), people kept voting for him at the polls.Now, though, his supporters worry that his Teflon popularity will wear thin. Inside the Republican party, Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictability has become a source of gnawing disquiet. \u201cHe\u2019s just not the normal candidate,\u201d said David Foreman, a delegate from Texas, complete with cowboy hat, during a break in speeches in Cleveland. \u201cHe\u2019s great talking, and people like that. But it scares them too. You never know what he\u2019s going to say next.\u201dThe broader question about the messy Cleveland convention is whether it will help or damage his popularity \u2014 and whether the chaos will continue through the fall.Republican operatives like Mr. Stevens predict his campaign will be swamped by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s slicker, better-funded effort. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching an amateur sports team playing professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amateurs might hang in there in the beginning. But by the end it\u2019s not very pretty.\u201dThen again, Mr. Stevens\u2019s candidate lost in 2012. And Mr. Trump can point to his long record of outwitting his detractors. At least on Thursday\u2019s closing night of the convention, his speech showed that his ability to tap the emotions and fears of his supporters remains undiminished.During a lengthy address in which he presented the United States as a country besieged by dangerous enemies, among them Islamic State terrorists and domestic criminals, the crowd repeatedly erupted into chants of \u201cU-S-A\u201d.\u201cHistory is watching us now,\u201d said Mr. Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie\u2019s Uninspiring Endorsement", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byBernie Sanders went off for a month to contemplate life after the revolution, and this was the best he could come up with? \u201cSecretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I congratulate her for that.\u201dSo said Sanders at a rally in New Hampshire on Tuesday, where he appeared on stage with Hillary Clinton as an ally for the first time. As big events go, it felt pretty small, with Sanders waving his arms around and offering up his usual list of shouted slogans.Sanders avoided subjects like war and foreign affairs, since he and Clinton disagree violently on those things. He harped on his successes, which was understandable, but it was passing strange when he claimed that he and his backers \u201cshowed the world that we could run a successful national campaign based on small individual contributions.\u201dYes, if you define successful as losing.Clinton \u2014 who actually wrapped up the nomination more than a month ago \u2014 stood next to him looking uncomfortable, nodding endlessly like a bobblehead doll and smiling at odd, seemingly random moments.The event was bound to be stiff, since Sanders has spent most of the year attacking Clinton as corrupt, excessively hawkish and beholden to Wall Street.So it would have been naive to expect Sanders to give Clinton a roaring tribute. But did it have to be as awkward as it was? Who thought of leaving the winner up there with the loser the entire time? The same public-relations genius who put Michael Dukakis in a tank in 1988?There were times when Clinton sounded almost excited about joining forces with Sanders, or at least pretending to. Perhaps more accurately, there were times when she sounded like Sanders, or at least pretended to.She trashed the Trans-Pacific trade pact that she once supported but that Sanders and his followers hate. Clinton grinned and nodded vigorously when Sanders talked about raising the federal minimum wage, even though she has disagreed with him in the past about how high it should go.\u201cThese aren\u2019t just my fights,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are Bernie\u2019s fights. These are America\u2019s fights.\u201dBut Clinton sounded distinctly more sincere about the state of play in the campaign at the very beginning of her speech, when she said of Sanders: \u201cBeing here with him in New Hampshire, I can\u2019t help but reflect how much more enjoyable this election is going to be now that we are on the same side.\u201dWill Sanders\u2019s fights continue to be Clinton\u2019s fights? Certainly, Sanders has steadily pushed Clinton to the left. She will probably keep pressing issues like trade and the minimum wage during the rest of the campaign, and she promised on Tuesday to pursue them as president. But we all know what happens to campaign promises.The Clinton campaign gave in to Sanders on some of these issues in the drafting of the Democratic Party platform over the weekend, and her concessions will keep the peace at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia at the end of this month.There will be the ritual first-round votes in which the Great State of Whatever proudly casts its votes for Sanders. But in the end, the platform will be adopted, Sanders will get his prime-time speaking slot, Clinton will be nominated and that will be that.The question for Clinton is how many of the 13 million people who voted for Sanders will vote for her \u2014 indeed how many of them will vote at all. Motivating that crowd is going to be the big challenge for Sanders if he was sincere on Tuesday when he promised to help Clinton get elected.He may need a different formula from the one he used on Tuesday \u2014 talking about the things on which he and Clinton now agree, and ignoring the ones on which they disagree.\u201cI have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children.\u201dWhat about her time as secretary of state? Sanders called his former opponent \u201cSecretary Clinton\u201d a couple of times, but never mentioned the State Department, probably because he has relentlessly attacked her over her record in that job.If his primary aim is to keep alive his cult of personality, perhaps all Sanders can do is accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. I\u2019m not sure that will get his supporters to vote in November.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Urges Civil Rights Activists and Police to Bridge Divide", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byWashington \u2014 President Obama said on Wednesday that the profound tensions between the police and African-American communities were likely to worsen \u201cfor quite some time\u201d after the series of wrenching shooting deaths this month, urging law enforcement officials and civil rights activists at a lengthy and at times tense White House gathering to keep pressing to bridge their differences.\u201cNot only are there very real problems but there are still deep divisions about how to solve these problems,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the White House, after meeting for over four hours all afternoon and into the evening with the group.\u201cThere is no doubt that police departments still feel embattled and unjustly accused, and there is no doubt that minority communities, communities of color, still feel like it just takes too long to do what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cWe have to, as a country, sit down and just grind it out \u2014 solve these problems.\u201dDuring a session that lasted for more than four hours in a large conference room across from the West Wing and included administration officials and community activists from the Black Lives Matter movement among the 40 or so in attendance, Mr. Obama led what he later called an \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cencouraging\u201d session about building trust between law enforcement and communities of color.\u201cWe\u2019re not even close to being there yet,\u201d the president said, adding that it will take time to achieve such trust.\u201cSadly, because this is a huge country that is very diverse, and we have a lot of police departments, I think it is fair to say that we will see more tension between police and communities this month, next month, next year, for quite some time,\u201d he said.That hostility flared at times behind closed doors at the session, particularly as those representing police organizations clashed with people who had been arrested at protests, said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of the online civil rights group Color of Change, who was at the meeting.\u201cWe still need many in law enforcement to recognize that action needs happen,\u201d Mr. Robinson said in an interview. \u201cWe can\u2019t mistake dialogue for actual change, and in the absence of action, nothing changes.\u201d\u201cWhat we heard was a willingness to listen, which means that we need to continue to raise everyday people\u2019s voices,\u201d he added.The hastily arranged meeting came a day after Mr. Obama traveled to Dallas to memorialize five police officers slain last week by an African-American man who said he wanted to kill white people. That attack unfolded during a peaceful protest of the killings just days earlier of two black men, in Baton Rouge, La., and outside St. Paul at the hands of the police. Both police shootings were captured on videotape.The deaths have opened the latest chapter in what has become an increasingly passionate debate in America over racial justice, discrimination and violence. Mr. Obama has conceded in recent days that he has felt powerless to shift the conversation or the realities driving it, whether by legislation or by persuasion, a cruel conundrum for the first African-American president, who campaigned for the White House arguing that there was no such thing as \u201cblack America\u201d and \u201cwhite America.\u201dReturning early from a European trip on Sunday, Mr. Obama scrapped his schedule for this week and has devoted much of his time to finding ways to address the crisis of race and law enforcement. On Monday, he stopped by a meeting of police officials and civil rights leaders convened by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. On Thursday, he will attend a town hall meeting devoted to the issue that ABC and ESPN will broadcast, at which the White House said Mr. Obama expected to hear from a diverse set of voices.Mr. Obama held a similar series of meetings two years ago after tensions boiled over following a police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., that sparked protests and rioting. Those meetings prompted the president to provide federal funding for community policing and anti-bias efforts, including for the purchase of body-worn cameras. He also created a policing task force that released recommendations last year on how to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they protect.The president is walking a difficult line as he seeks to make progress on stubbornly entrenched divisions and build trust between constituencies that have only grown more suspicious of each other.Some law enforcement officials have bristled at Mr. Obama\u2019s readiness to condemn racial bias in policing after fatal confrontations between officers and African-American men. At the same time, racial justice activists, including those involved in Black Lives Matter, have expressed frustration with Mr. Obama for his expressions of sympathy with police serving in African-American communities ravaged by poverty and violence.Before the meeting on Wednesday, some of them called on his administration to eliminate federal grants for police forces that fail to make changes.Mr. Robinson said the president mentioned the proposal during Wednesday\u2019s meeting as \u201cone of the levers they need to be able to use for both the carrot and the stick\u201d to promote better policing.Later, in a Facebook post in which he asked Americans to reach out in their communities to heal divisions, the president said of Wednesday\u2019s meeting: \u201cI\u2019ll admit, it was a candid discussion \u2014 challenging at times. But it couldn\u2019t have been more important.\u201d\u201cI want to ask you \u2014 no matter who you are or where you live \u2014 to do whatever you can to foster these conversations and find solutions for your community,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote. \u201cI know it\u2019s possible \u2014 I saw it happen this afternoon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Yahoo Ruled the Valley: Stories of the Original \u2018Surfers\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Back in the mid-1990s, before Google even existed, the world\u2019s best guides to the internet sat in Silicon Valley cubicles, visiting websites and carefully categorizing them by hand.They were called surfers, and they were a collection of mostly 20-somethings \u2014 including a yoga lover, an ex-banker, a divinity student, a recent college grad from Ohio hungry for adventure \u2014 all hired by a start-up called Yahoo to build a directory of the world\u2019s most interesting websites.Today, with more than one billion websites across the globe, the very notion seems mad. Even then, there was a hint of insanity about the enterprise.Two decades after Yahoo\u2019s founding \u2014 the equivalent of several lifetimes in Silicon Valley \u2014 Elvis still serenades the surfers at the headquarters here in Sunnyvale, and Yahoo is at a crossroads. The company, long since eclipsed by Google and Facebook, now commands just a tiny fraction of people\u2019s attention and advertisers\u2019 dollars.Yahoo is auctioning itself off. Bids are due on Monday, the same day the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is expected to report yet another quarter of dismal financial results.Most, but not all, of the surfers have scattered across Silicon Valley and the world. The careers of some followed the arc of the tech world\u2019s obsessions and idiosyncrasies over the last 20 years. Others took their stock windfalls and dropped out to pursue other passions. Taken together, the surfers, about 10 of whom are still in the building, embody the technological and cultural changes that transformed the valley and the world \u2014 and left Yahoo in the dust.Back in 1994, when the directory was born, search engines were rudimentary and ineffectual. Newbies were just learning how to navigate the World Wide Web. The very idea of a website was novel.Two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, saw opportunity. Working from a trailer on campus, they began compiling websites into a list, organized by topic. They eventually named it Yahoo, an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.It quickly became one of the most important gateways to the web. The value proposition was simple, said one longtime surfer, Dave Sikula: \u201cWe\u2019ve done the work for you \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through the web and these are the best sites.\u201dThat required an army of people, said Srinija Srinivasan, employee No. 5 at Yahoo, who was hired to build the original surfer team.It was serious work, deciding how to label things and where to put them. What do you call a category that includes skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan? What kind of pornography should be considered for inclusion, given that \u201csex\u201d was the most popular search term from the start?Much was left to individual judgment. Matthew Mustapick, who quit a job at Wells Fargo to become a surfer in 1995, recalled creating the \u201ccannibalism\u201d category. He found sites explaining how to butcher a human body but decided they were too distasteful to include.Amey Mathews, who worked as a Yahoo surfer from 1998 to 2002 (and is now married to Mr. Mustapick), discovered in the course of her work that the Irish originally carved their jack-o\u2019-lanterns from turnips, not pumpkins. After that, the surfers held a turnip-carving contest every Halloween.The directory survived until 2014. But by then, most of the surfers\u2019 time already went to other projects. Many of them worked to improve Yahoo\u2019s search engine as it battled with Alphabet\u2019s Google subsidiary. Still, Yahoo\u2019s star continued to fade, particularly with the rise of smartphones and social applications like Facebook and Twitter.Today, some former surfers ponder the company\u2019s fate with sadness and a hint of regret at opportunities missed. \u201cYahoo Mail is still my primary email. My home page is still My Yahoo. I still look at the sports page,\u201d said Mr. Sikula, who is a stage director and freelance editor after being laid off in 2010 as part of a big surfer cutback.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know why the company exists. And I think that\u2019s what they are trying to figure out, too.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t chosen to study Japanese at Stanford, Srinija Srinivasan would never have found herself in charge of building Yahoo\u2019s directory into a guide to the internet for a curious world.Ms. Srinivasan, who grew up in Kansas, was an undergraduate attending a tech-focused Stanford program in Kyoto, Japan, when she got to know two fellow students over shared meals \u2014 Jerry Yang and David Filo. After graduation, she was working on the Cyc Project, an early effort to create artificial intelligence, when the pair asked her to help them turn their directory into a real company.\u201cJerry and David knew that I alphabetized my CDs,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan, 44, said in an interview in her Palo Alto, Calif., home. \u201cMy sock drawer is quite beautiful.\u201dWhen she joined, her business card read Ontological Yahoo, a term reflecting her philosophical approach to the job. \u201cThis is not a perfunctory file-keeping exercise. This is defining the nature of being,\u201d she said. \u201cCategories and classifications are the basis for each of our worldviews. \u201dFaced with the vastness of the web, Yahoo surfers hoped to identify the most complete, relevant or interesting sites on a given subject. To choose which topics to focus on, the surfers relied in part on a daily log of visitors\u2019 top queries.Once in a while, surfers made mistakes. For instance, they initially categorized Messianic Judaism as a Jewish sect, failing to notice that its adherents, who follow many Jewish traditions, believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, a defining trait of Christians. \u201cWe had faxes coming in nonstop from rabbis,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said.Yahoo also offered automated search tools by teaming up with various companies, including AltaVista and Google. Eventually, though, Yahoo realized that it had to develop its own version of the technology.Human judgment \u2014 what Mr. Yang referred to as \u201cthe voice of Yahoo\u201d \u2014 remained a core value of the company. When the Grateful Dead musician Jerry Garcia died in August 1995, Yahoo searches on him spiked immediately. The surfers put a Garcia link on the home page. \u201cThat was the birth of Yahoo News,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said. Today, it remains one of the most popular online news portals.The surfers\u2019 role as corporate conscience expanded with the company. They worked on a child-safe version of Yahoo, called Yahooligans. They selected the news headlines worthy of home-page display. Over time, Ms. Srinivasan and her team even fielded questions like how much cleavage to allow on home-page ads.Despite its efforts, Yahoo kept losing ground to Google in search. Microsoft made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy the weakened company in 2008. Ms. Srinivasan left two years later, soon after Mr. Yang stepped down as chief executive. \u201cIn Japan, they have a saying: Leave when the cherry blossoms are full,\u201d she said.She also sits on the board of trustees of her alma mater, Stanford, a school that has churned out several generations of Silicon Valley moguls. But unlike many former technology executives, Ms. Srinivasan focuses her attention there on the arts and humanities.\u201cTech is sexy. It\u2019s employable. Parents love it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that isn\u2019t worth a hill of beans unless we know why, to what end. We call it the humanities for a reason.\u201dYahoo, like the early web itself, was largely focused on American content. But it had global ambitions. Seana Meek, an Alberta native and a single mother, was working for Futurekids, which taught children computer basics, when Yahoo hired her to organize the Canadian sites in its directory.For Ms. Meek personally, it kicked off a 20-year career odyssey through modern Silicon Valley and some of the tech industry\u2019s most significant trends: e-commerce, virtual reality, fraud-fighting \u2014 even a mobile haircut app.When she started, Yahoo was fumbling in Canada. Technically, it had a separate Canada site, but it relied on the American directory for its searches.Employees asked her why the most popular search term among Canadian users was the word Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d Ms. Meek, 41, recalled saying. \u201cIn Canada, you do \u2018government\u2019 and you get American results. So you do \u2018government Canada.\u2019 You do anything and then you add \u2018Canada\u2019 to it.\u201dAfter the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Yahoo\u2019s dysfunctions began to surface. In 2002, the company transferred Ms. Meek\u2019s job to Toronto. Less than 90 days later, it closed that office and sent her and two engineers back to the American headquarters.She got a promotion from the mess: Yahoo put her in charge of the content, ads and business deals for Yahoo Canada. She was nicknamed Captain Canada and had a ringside seat to one of the company\u2019s biggest decisions \u2014 dumping Google as a search partner and switching to technology from its Inktomi acquisition instead. \u201cThey were scared to do it. So they did it in Canada first,\u201d she said.In 2008, she left the company, embarking on a journey through Silicon Valley\u2019s laboratory of business ideas, big and small. First she joined a tiny start-up, Picateers, that was trying to reinvent the school portrait business. It folded a year later.From there she went to Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, the tech industry\u2019s first big foray into virtual reality. Players interacted with one another online in a 3-D simulated world, where they could buy and sell things, make friends, or just gawk at the scenery.Second Life was an extraordinary experiment in human behavior, she said. An employee could change something in the virtual world, then just watch what happened. \u201cYou are literally a god,\u201d she said.Next for her was Eventbrite, an online event-planning and ticketing company. There she worked to protect against credit card fraud.And she says, she is casting about for the next challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny time in my life where there is definitely no script,\u201d she said.Working long hours in close quarters, it was inevitable that some surfers would find romance.For Matthew Mustapick and Amey Mathews, working at Yahoo didn\u2019t just lead to love. The lessons they learned \u2014 and the money they made from the stock they received as early employees \u2014 allowed them to achieve a different kind of Silicon Valley dream: dropping out of tech to do their own thing.Ms. Mathews, who had a fine arts degree from Stanford, joined in 1998 after responding to an ad looking for a speaker of Scandinavian languages. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t speak any Scandinavian languages \u2014 but I speak Italian and you should have someone who speaks Italian,\u201d she recalled during an interview at the couple\u2019s home in Soquel, Calif.Yahoo had an Italian speaker already, but she got a job anyway. Mr. Mustapick sat in a nearby cubicle, and they eventually became a couple.Surfers were free to reflect their personal interests in the directory. Ms. Mathews loved animals and indexed all the dogs, cattle, even miniature donkeys, she could find. Mr. Mustapick was fond of cataloging oddities like prosthetic testicles for pets that had been neutered.Mr. Mustapick left Yahoo in early 2002. Ms. Mathews followed later that year.\u201cI could afford to lose money for a whole year when no one came to my class,\u201d she said.Mr. Mustapick turned toward music. \u201cI always wanted to learn how to play electric guitar like Scott Henderson,\u201d he said, referring to the jazz and blues guitarist. That interest led him in an unexpected direction \u2014 he began building acoustic guitars with an eye toward selling them.Having looked at hundreds of thousands of websites while at Yahoo, he had a good sense of how to market online, well before the era of Twitter and self-promotion as a national pastime. He built a website and posted photos of guitars he was building so customers could watch the progress.And he consciously befriended the right people. \u201cThey just put the word out for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the sort of thing I learned at Yahoo that you could do.\u201dStill, she remembers Yahoo fondly. \u201cI loved being around that many smart, interesting, engaged people,\u201d she said. \u201cI actively miss that in my daily life \u2014 not enough to go get a job and give up what I\u2019m doing, but I do miss it.\u201dNine years ago, Gordon Hurd quit Yahoo for the second time. In June, he began working for the company again \u2014 Round 3 \u2014 this time as a freelance writer.In the intervening years, Mr. Hurd toured the struggling new-media landscape \u2014 first, the Yahoo archrival AOL; then, Interactive One, a network of black news and culture sites; later, First Look Media, created by the eBay founder Pierre M. Omidyar; and most recently, a men\u2019s fashion site, Man\u2019s Life. There was even a brief stint at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm and \u201cthe most corporate place you could go,\u201d he said.Mr. Hurd\u2019s first run with Yahoo started in 1998 when he was hired to organize the business and finance parts of the directory. The starting pay was only $35,000 a year, he recalled. But there were stock options.\u201cI didn\u2019t make millions by any means,\u201d said Mr. Hurd, 45, in a phone interview from Brooklyn, where he lives. But he bought a house.A restless soul, he left Yahoo in 2002 to become an investigative reporter for a local magazine. Less than a year later, with a second child on the way, Mr. Hurd returned to Yahoo, eventually helping run the influential home page.In 2007, he hopped to McKinsey and then quickly to AOL, where he ran Asylum.com, a lifestyle site aimed at men age 18 to 34. The business model was to create vast amounts of content in the hope that visitors would click on ads.That didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWhat it underlined is how much of a commodity content was,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. Asylum was shut down.Mr. Hurd moved on to Interactive One, the digital arm of Radio One, the largest black-owned radio broadcaster in the United States, which struggled to crack the content code, too. Volume trumped quality. \u201cYou know people will click on a subway-fight video, but you want to talk about what it\u2019s like to be a millennial of color,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.Which is how, today, Mr. Hurd is back at Yahoo, writing articles for its style site while he ponders his next move.More than ever, he thinks there is a need for the type of work that Yahoo\u2019s surfers did 20 years ago. \u201cThe web has gotten so big that you need people to curate it,\u201d he said.However, he sees that curation coming from subject experts, not mass-audience sites like Yahoo. Niche sites with a devoted following could work with select sponsors hoping to reach a particular audience, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019s really dedicated to the art of handmade knives, and you set out to categorize the sites of handmade knives, only you can do that. Google can never do that,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.When Becky Uline graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio in 1996, she didn\u2019t really know what she wanted to do with her life. A friend was raving that he had discovered paradise \u2014 living in Northern California and working for a company few people had ever heard of, Yahoo.She and another Bowling Green graduate, Michelle Heimburger, thought it would be a grand adventure. They both got hired as surfers and rented an apartment together.The building was so empty at first that surfers would zip through it on in-line skates. \u201cWe would sleep under our desks,\u201d Ms. Uline, 42, recalled during an interview at her current home in Oakland, Calif.In 2001, Ms. Uline gave her notice. She wanted to travel the world, financed in part by her Yahoo nest egg.Paris became a favorite haunt. \u201cI would sublet my apartment out for a few months and just go and work from wherever,\u201d she said. She freelanced for Yahoo and also tapped the vast network of surfer alumni, landing work at the visual-search start-up SearchMe and elsewhere.Yahoo\u2019s decline is sad, Ms. Uline said, but she still feels a connection. Her closest friends are former Yahoos, including Ms. Heimburger, who married yet another surfer and lives in London.A few months ago, Ms. Uline, said, she dropped Yahoo as her home page, but she missed it and changed it back. \u201cI still use Yahoo search. I want them to get the revenue,\u201d she said.When Yahoo set out to hire surfers, it invented a new job category. The closest match may have been bookstore clerk \u2014 and Kepler\u2019s Books in nearby Menlo Park turned into a recruitment hotbed. About a dozen surfers were hired away from the shop, including ConnieAlice Hungate.Ms. Hungate, 46, is still at Yahoo more than 18 years later, supervising what remains of the surfer team. She said the group, renamed content analysis and management, is still vital to the company\u2019s ambitions to remain a player in web search.Search ads bring in nearly half of Yahoo\u2019s revenue. Under a 2010 deal with Microsoft, Yahoo uses Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine for most basic queries and ads.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, has devoted vast resources to search technology \u2014 particularly on mobile devices \u2014 in an attempt to leapfrog Google, though the company has little to show for it so far.Ms. Hungate said her team helped train Yahoo\u2019s search algorithms to provide more relevant results. The mobile search app, for example, now automatically pulls up suggestions for nearby places to eat when lunchtime rolls around.The Elvis sculpture, a 1998 gift from a Yahoo user, still watches over the department, and the turnip-carving contest is held every Halloween \u2014 with results posted on Flickr, the photo-sharing service owned by Yahoo.Ms. Hungate said she was not worried about what would happen to the surfers if the company was sold. \u201cInformation management is a core need in technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll adapt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Having fallen far behind the United States in such missilery, and eager to avoid a costly new weapons buildup, he decided to place his plentiful medium-range missiles into Cuba and thus put American targets in his sights and partially close his missile gap. To help Khrushchev save face in the Kremlin when he felt forced to withdraw the missiles from the island, the Kennedys agreed to withdraw a few obsolete American missiles from Turkey and promised not to invade Cuba \u2014 but they insisted that those commitments remain secret, as they did for many years.MAX FRANKELNEW YORKThe writer, a former executive editor of The Times, is the author of \u201cHigh Noon in the Cold War \u2014 Kennedy, Khrushchev and the Cuban Missile Crisis.\u201d\u2b25How to Fight Crime To the Editor:Crime fighting is a critically important part of modern policing, but it is only a part. Public service means connecting with the public they serve, getting involved with the people, breaking up fights, taking reports, referring complaints, giving advice where appropriate, and really making friends with the law-abiding people where the officers are assigned. The foot patrol officer of yesteryear can positively affect a whole neighborhood in a way that officers shielded inside radio cars or involved solely in making arrests can never accomplish.Where I strongly agree with Mac Donald is on the importance of letting police officers make arrests (not just issue summonses) for fare beating (turnstile jumping) and disorderly conduct. Back around 1990 when Bratton and the late Jack Maple were with the New York City Transit Police, they proved that arresting turnstile jumpers, getting positive identifications, checking warrants and so on netted career criminals who couldn\u2019t resist jumping the turnstiles. Criminals who jump turnstiles rarely provide their true identification, so arrests are necessary. This is just too valuable a crime-fighting tool to sacrifice in the name of public relations.MICHAEL J. GORMANWHITESTONE, N.Y.\u2b25Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "Cambodian Opposition Figure\u2019s Killing Recalls Darker Times", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 A prominent Cambodian political commentator who had recently helped found a new independent political party was gunned down at a gas station in central Phnom Penh on Sunday morning in what analysts called a major setback for democracy and freedom of expression in the country.The commentator, Kem Ley, 46, had stopped in for his morning coffee at the station\u2019s convenience store when he was shot and killed.\u201cThe offender was arrested and is being interrogated,\u201d said Gen. Kirth Chantharith, a spokesman for the Cambodian National Police. The general added that the man had identified himself as Chuob Samlab, an unlikely name that translates as \u201cMeet Kill\u201d in the Khmer language.The police said in a statement that the suspect, 38, was from a rural area along Cambodia\u2019s western border and had migrated to Thailand to work on a plantation.A leaked video of his confession to the police that circulated on social media showed him with blood streaked across his face as he explained that he had bought a pistol in Thailand with the intention of killing Mr. Kem Ley because he was owed $3,000.With its brazenness and high-profile target, the killing seemed to hark back to an era of political violence in Cambodia that many had hoped was over.The leading Cambodian opposition figure, Sam Rainsy, called the killing an \u201cassassination\u201d and an \u201cact of state terrorism\u201d on Facebook.Public assassinations of opposition figures and union leaders occurred with chilling regularity throughout the 1990s and mid-2000s, but began to taper off about a decade ago as the country\u2019s long-ruling authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, managed to defeat or buy off his rivals and consolidate much of the country\u2019s political power.Mr. Hun Sen condemned the killing in a statement on Facebook and called for greater security.Mr. Kem Ley was already a well-known commentator in 2014 when he announced that he was fed up with the country\u2019s political scene, which he called stagnant and elitist. He founded a political action network that he hoped would develop new leaders and tackle issues important to farmers that go untouched by both major parties.Last year, his Khmer for Khmer network registered the Grassroots Democracy Party and announced that it would field candidates for local elections in 2017.\u201cHe could simplify complicated ideas into the language of the people,\u201d said Ou Virak, the head of Future Forum, a local think tank. \u201cHe was straightforward, often able to narrate stories to make his point interesting and to get the message across to ordinary Cambodians.\u2019\u2019Mr. Ou Virak said the killing would have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Cambodia, making government critics fear for their safety as they had in the past.An angry and grieving crowd of hundreds gathered on Sunday at the gas station where Mr. Kem Ley was shot. Yang Sokhy, a motorcycle-taxi driver, had arrived with a packet of incense, hoping to be allowed to light a stick and pray over Mr. Kem Ley\u2019s body.\u201cI\u2019m just a citizen who liked him, his fan, because he spoke the truth about what is happening in our society,\u201d Mr. Yang Sokhy, 37, said. \u201cIn our country, it\u2019s always like this. All people who dare to speak out meet this ending.\u201dNeou Vannarin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Protests and Prayers in Dallas", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDallas \u2014 On Friday, the city of Dallas was in mourning, and so was I.We lost five police officers. They were gunned down at a peaceful protest on Thursday night that took place just a few blocks from where I live. I was at that protest too.So was my friend Angela. She stayed longer than I did, leaving right before the shots rang out. \u201cPeaceful crowd. Sprits lifted and prepped for action. Sad to see it turn out like this,\u201d she later wrote on Facebook.Everyone is sad to see it turn out like this. The city planned a prayer vigil for noon on Friday and I decided to go and maybe to stay until the end this time.I walked to Thanks-Giving Square, where the vigil was held, down a street lined with police officers in their dress blue uniforms. They were pleasant to everyone who greeted them. Some people took pictures. I took a photo of some people posing with the police too.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d I said, and others in the crowd expressed condolences as well.I imagine it feels, for the Dallas police, as if a member of their family has died.That\u2019s how it felt for me, watching the terrible news earlier in the week, hearing about Alton B. Sterling and Philando Castile. And how it felt after we lost Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and the long list of others.I walked to the center of the square and stood on the steps next to a man dressed in a business suit. It was hot \u2014 96 degrees. I drank a bottle of water but he didn\u2019t open his. The speakers, seemingly every dignitary and politician from the area, were lined up under a circular plaque that read: \u201cCome into his courts with praise. Psalm 100.\u201d We bowed our heads in prayer.\u201cWere you there last night?\u201d I whispered to the man in the suit.\u201cYeah, I am one of the organizers. I\u2019m James.\u201dWe whispered back and forth to each other between and during the speeches.\u201cThe crowd is different today,\u201d he said.I nodded. There were many more people, maybe 1,000. It appeared as if the majority of them were white. The atmosphere was different. The voice of Black Lives Matter had become a silent whisper between James and me.\u201cThey\u2019re blaming us,\u201d he said.At one point, a speaker said the answer was to love one another. The speaker said, I want everybody here to find someone in the crowd who is different from you and shake his hand and give him a hug.James and I exchanged glances. Several white people were lined up against the wall to my left. They hugged each other as they clasped hands. A few of them looked at me, and I awkwardly shook their hands and hugged them. I didn\u2019t see James hug anyone, and I wished that I hadn\u2019t either. My Southern politeness kicked in, even though I always find a forced hug uncomfortable.During the vigil, a parade of dignitaries spoke: preachers of every faith, City Council members, the police chief. Friday belonged to the city officials and the necessary public mourning. But Thursday night, before the shooting, the Black Lives Matter protests belonged to us, the people who were mourning two senseless deaths at the hands of the police in Louisiana and Minnesota.The police chief, David Brown, took his turn speaking. He was the hero of the hour. He had captured the villain who killed his officers. He was proud of his accomplishments and the audience was moved by his speech. He told us how most of the time, wearing the police uniform in Dallas, he hears negative comments and gets complaints. But it felt good today, it gave him some measure of comfort, to hear the words: \u201cThank you.\u201dThe crowd then spontaneously shouted, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe chant went through the crowd, all of us who had found someone different from us to hug: \u201cThank you.\u201dThe chant that resonated more with me was from Thursday night.\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d the crowd chanted. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d I chanted along too, with the call and response, standing on the edge of the park just a few blocks from my home.I had gone to the protest that night not only to show respect for the deceased and their families but for myself, for my well-being. It\u2019s similar to the reason we attend funerals. I wanted to be with the bereaved so that we could lift up each other.People young and old, black, white, Latino, were taking a stand in Dallas on Thursday night. One little boy had a sign pinned to his back with a quotation from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on it. Police officers and citizens talked and took selfies. The speakers stepped to the microphone, one by one, to speak about the horrific deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota. Their volume rose as they spoke about hope, and they finished with chants \u2014 \u201cEnough is enough\u201d; \u201cNo more 404,\u201d the police code when something like this happens; \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d I clapped and I chanted too. But whatever I had gone to the protest for, I was feeling the opposite effect.I decided to leave early, around 8, so I wouldn\u2019t have to walk home in the dark. Also my phone had died.When I was home and plugged it back in, I saw a text from my friend Angela. She told me to turn on the news.I watched the cameras broadcasting images of the park where I had just been standing, the police officers who had been posing for selfies now under attack.How could the peaceful demonstration I had been a part of turned to this?I live two blocks from Baylor Hospital and I heard sirens going back and forth all night.I was at the protest Thursday night to be lifted up out of my sadness. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d we chanted. I added my voice. But it was not enough because within a couple of hours five more people were dead.Advertisement"}

Regardless of what you believe about Hillary, is this the spokesperson in chief you want for our nation?\u201d\u201cJust imagine, for even a brief second, what he might say when he is president. Who he might talk to on the \u2018red phone.\u2019 Remember, when he talks he says what HE thinks is right, not what the world believes.\u201dSome readers said Mr. Trump was committing an act of patriotism by seeking to expose Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email and were skeptical that he intended harm with his remarks.\u201cI hate to say it, but if it was Russia, thank goodness that someone had the urge to expose another crooked and rigged system. If you will recall, Trump has said all along that the DNC and Clinton rigged the primaries \u2026 and he was right.\u201d\u201cIf you listen to the whole quote it was obviously tongue-in cheek, not foot-in-mouth. He was making a joke about Hillary deleting all of those emails.\u201d\u201cI was astounded when commentators took Trump\u2019s statement at literal face value. Let\u2019s hope no one ever tells one of these people to go jump off a bridge.\u201d\u201cMaybe the American people deserve to see them. She had them open for the [taking].\u201dSeveral commenters accused Mr. Trump of sedition or treason and demanded that he be punished. \u201cThat Donald Trump would encourage a tyrant like Vladimir Putin and his surrogates to meddle in our affairs is treason of the highest order.The fact that he would encourage our adversary for his own political gain shows he would stop at nothing to get what he wants. He doesn\u2019t care about anyone or anything other than himself.I wouldn\u2019t ever count on a turncoat traitor like Donald Trump to have my back under any circumstances.\u201d\u201cTo call on a foreign government to engage in espionage against your political opponent that is a former member of the government is sedition and the stuff of banana republics.\u201d\u201cTrump just can\u2019t stomach the fact that he is not front and center in the media this week, so he has to come up with something to divert the media\u2019s attention to him. Pitiful excuse for a human, let alone a presidential candidate.\u201d\u201cThis is just Trump\u2019s latest stunt to take the news cycle away from the D.N.C. Stop wasting time parsing the meaning of this nonsense!\u201d\u201cIf President Trump saw his approval ratings fall, he might well conspire with Putin to do something nefarious to raise his ratings, even if it meant selling the secrets or the principles of his country. Yes, Hillary is sometimes not completely trustworthy, but Trump has taken untrustworthiness to a new level.\u201d\u201cThe chief complaint about Hillary Clinton is that she seems inauthentic because she is overly cautious and measures her responses. Well, here\u2019s a perfect example of the opposite of that. Is this who we want in charge? This should be taken very seriously.\u201dHow U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Online Video Surges, Publishers Turn to Automation", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byIn a television appearance in early June, Michael W. Ferro Jr., the chairman of the newspaper and magazine publishing company Tronc \u2014 formerly known as Tribune Publishing \u2014 made an astonishing claim.\u201cRight now we\u2019re doing a couple hundred videos a day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we need to be doing 2,000 videos a day.\u201dMr. Ferro\u2019s comments added to mounting confusion over his embattled company\u2019s sudden rebranding. How could a newspaper publisher create nearly three-quarters of a million videos a year?But as jarring as Tronc\u2019s goals may sound, the company\u2019s plan is far from novel. In pursuit of more lucrative video advertising and success on dominant social platforms like Facebook, a growing number of publishers have turned to technology that promises to streamline video production, sometimes to the point of near-full automation.The market for this service is largely split between two companies, Wochit and Wibbitz, which both maintain offices in New York City and Tel Aviv. (Wochit also has an office in London.) Wibbitz\u2019s customers include Bonnier magazines, Hearst, Gannett and the Weather Channel, which uses the service to create local news reports. Customers of Wochit have included Time Inc., CBS Interactive, The Huffington Post, Rotten Tomatoes and NowThis News.\u201cTraditionally we\u2019ve employed teams \u2014 someone out shooting and someone able to cut up and produce the video,\u201d said Chris Pirrone, who manages USA Today\u2019s digital sports publications. \u201cDoing that is one, expensive, and two, takes a while to turn around. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve found these tools useful.\u201dBonnier, publisher of Popular Science and Saveur, recently announced a partnership with Wibbitz. \u201cFor us, as a company with over 30 titles, it really allows us to create a lot more video,\u201d said Sean Holzman, chief digital revenue officer at Bonnier.The two services\u2019 automation features work in similar ways. They analyze, and may summarize, text, be it a script or a traditional news article, and then automatically find photographs and video clips to go with it. The services typically get the videos and images from sources like The Associated Press and Getty Images.Additionally, the tools offer the option to quickly put large animated captions over the videos, in a format that has become popular on Facebook, where videos begin playing automatically and are often watched with the sound off. Each can also supply, through a third party, on-demand human narration; Wibbitz offers computerized voice-overs as well.The level of human intervention before publishing is up to the clients. They can be hands-on from the start, making edits, adding original material and using the tools to speed things along. Or they can let the machines do almost all the work \u2014 betting that it will be good enough for viewers \u2014 or, at least, for advertisers. Wibbitz can scan a website and create a \u201crough cut\u201d video for every published article.Wochit clients produce about 30,000 videos a month, according to the company, a number that has doubled since January. Wibbitz says it has twice as many clients now as it did at the start of the year, and the number of videos published using the company\u2019s software has increased more than sixfold in the same time period.\u201cThe way we see it, we can help you increase your video inventory in a very significant way,\u201d said Zohar Dayan, a co-founder and chief executive of Wibbitz.There is also the promise of money. Many publishers, like Tronc, are searching for ways to increase online revenue, as revenue from web advertising remains stubbornly low and print revenue continues to decline. Video advertisements tend to warrant higher rates than other online ads.Automatically generated videos are appearing in growing numbers on news companies\u2019 websites and social pages, but they\u2019re not always easy to spot. Here are a few examples.Wibbitz and Wochit split advertising revenue with some publishers; Wochit sells subscriptions as well. Some sites are adding the videos on the same page as a related story. Often, the videos \u2014 preloaded with ad spots \u2014 start playing automatically.Tech giants have dabbled in forms of automated video production, albeit for different sorts of customers. In 2014, Facebook generated personalized \u201cLook Back\u201d videos from user profiles to celebrate the company\u2019s 10th anniversary. Last week, the company rolled out a \u201cslide show\u201d feature, which automatically stitches together images from users\u2019 photo collections into short videos, in its iPhone app.In June, Google released the highly automated video production tool YouTube Director, intended to encourage business owners to make video ads.Publishers are cautiously optimistic about the potential of video automation tools, and not just for the pre-existing tasks that they make cheaper and faster. But publishers are keenly aware of how quickly new online formats can be commoditized, and, after years of chasing traffic \u2014 most recently from Google and Facebook \u2014 how rapidly advantages can evaporate.Mr. Pirrone of USA Today said his sites were already moving beyond straightforward conversion of articles into videos.\u201cThe data came back very quickly that text-to-video alone, if you don\u2019t touch it, consumers can quickly recognize it is not a high-quality product,\u201d Mr. Pirrone said.Mr. Dayan of Wibbitz said, \u201cThere still needs to be a human, a process, to give that personal touch.\u201dIn the longer term, publishers\u2019 plans for these tools may be less about industrial-scale article conversion than giving an extra set of tools \u2014 and responsibilities \u2014 to journalists. Publishers described the services as supplemental to more conventional video teams, freeing up resources and letting nonspecialist employees make videos as well.\u201cThe way we create video hasn\u2019t changed in decades,\u201d said Dror Ginzberg, a founder and the chief executive of Wochit, who characterized Wochit\u2019s features as an extension of capabilities and shortcuts provided by existing video production software.As for Tronc and its 2,000-a-day video goal, Wibbitz counts among its investors NantMobile, a firm headed by the biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, who happens to be the second-largest stakeholder in Tronc. Neither company would say whether they had a partnership; representatives for Tronc said that its automated video production would be a mixture of \u201cinternal and external\u201d technologies. Some Tronc properties currently publish videos bearing a Wochit logo; Gannett, which recently initiated a hostile takeover of Tronc, has used Wochit and Wibbitz.In a video created for employees but released publicly in June, Malcolm CasSelle, Tronc\u2019s chief technology officer, laid out his company\u2019s rationale. \u201cThe C.P.M. that we can earn with a video, or visualized content, is significantly higher than a page without it,\u201d he said, referring to advertising rates on news articles.The company stood by its plans. \u201cWhen it comes to video, we can monetize our video best within the player on our site,\u201d said Anne Vasquez, the company\u2019s chief digital officer, referring to a plan to include video on half of all article pages by next year.\u201cVideo is video,\u201d Mr. CasSelle said. \u201cWe\u2019re producing it because it\u2019s strategic and important.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re also going to continue to augment with these tools. It could be that the augmented video is so efficient that it outpaces human-generated video.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Baton Rouge Gunman and \u2018Targeted Individuals\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Long, who was killed in the shootout, said in online posts and videos that he was a victim of a vast government conspiracy that watches and harasses everyday Americans.Mental health professionals say a large number of people involved in the discussions appear to suffer from psychotic illnesses such as delusional disorder or schizophrenia. In the past, they might have suffered alone, but the internet has allowed like-minded people to easily share their obsessions with strangers around the country.In the wake of the shooting, websites, Facebook groups and conference calls for people who believe they have been targeted have lit up with discussions about Mr. Long, with several members saying they had correspondence with him. They voiced concerns that the attack could set their movement back. An overwhelming majority say they are as appalled by violence as anyone else.In a blog he maintained, he shared an article that asserted that gang-stalking would better be described as \u201cpolice-gang-stalking\u201d because \u201c99% of all gang-stalking\u201d is perpetrated by the police, SITE said in a report released on Monday.In one of his recent podcasts, he talked about being closely monitored by Marine Corps superiors who singled him out. He served from 2005 to 2010.\u201cOnce they knew that I was a man and I would stand on my rights, that nothing they could do could scare me, that\u2019s when they knew, they really, really had to keep a close eye on me,\u201d he said.A minute-by-minute account of the shooting, with maps and video.Mr. Long suggested that the government had \u201cblacklisted\u201d him from employment after his military service ended, and he said that it had instructed friends to stay away from him. \u201cEssentially, basically, it\u2019s isolation,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want that spirit of courage to spread. Because their whole gimmick is fear.\u201dIn a comment on a conspiracy-minded website, he urged \u201cfellow T.I.\u2019s\u201d to keep their beliefs to themselves. Assume everyone they know \u2014 friends and family included \u2014 was in on it, he said.Those remarks set him apart from people who identify themselves as leaders of the movement. They have increasingly sought to publicize their plight as a legitimate human rights concern, creating awareness campaigns and lobbying for their causes in courts and legislatures.Mental health professionals note that people suffering from psychosis often spiral into isolation and depression but rarely resort to violence.Mr. Long, who sought to reinvent himself as a wellness coach and a \u201cfreedom strategist\u201d after leaving the military, at one point volunteered as an emotional support contact for other people who believed they were victims, according to the former leader of a T.I. group, Derrick Robinson.He once described his plight by drawing an analogy to a slave plantation. \u201cI\u2019m the one that\u2019s freeing slaves. So what do you think they would do to the person that\u2019s freeing slaves from the plantation?\u201d he told a podcast interviewer in May. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that they would target and harass that individual?\u201dAsked by the host, Lance Scurvin, to respond to people\u2019s skepticism, Mr. Long said, \u201cYou just can\u2019t put nothing past this society.\u201d\u201cIf you study history, you know that they\u2019ll do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the power of evil.\u201dEven so, Mr. Long played down the fear and urged others to reject the label of \u201ctargeted individual.\u201d He told Mr. Scurvin: \u201cThat\u2019s just a small aspect of me. I can tell people about it, but it\u2019s not a complete picture of who I am. I\u2019m infinite.

{"Headline": "The Hazards of Ankle Sprains", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Many fashion-conscious women wear high heels to show off their legs. But in truth, given the extraordinarily high incidence of ankle sprains, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably all be better off if we had thick stumps like an elephant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to connect our feet to our legs.Every day in the United States, about 28,000 people sprain an ankle. Too often the injury is dismissed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust a sprain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with no specific treatment and a return to full activity before it has completely healed. Fully 45 percent of all athletic injuries are ankle sprains, and players often go back into the game with little or no treatment as soon as the pain subsides.Yet the majority of ankle sprains are doomed to recur. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they often result in a chronically unstable joint that tends to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d poor balance, a distorted gait, difficulty exercising, weight gain, diminished quality of life and early arthritis. Not to mention the expense of dealing with health problems that can result from being overweight and sedentary living.Sound scary? It should, says Phillip A. Gribble, an athletic trainer at the University of Kentucky and co-director of the International Ankle Consortium, who hopes that knowing the potential consequences of ankle injuries will prompt more people to treat them with respect and seek proper treatment. Even better, he said, would be if more people took steps to prevent injury in the first place. And that, ladies, may include leaving those spike heels in the store.Dr. Gribble was one of several experts who recently presented the latest technical information on ankle sprains to the National Athletic Trainers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Association meeting in Baltimore. In a study of 3,526 adults who responded to a questionnaire, more than half, or 1,843, had previously sustained an ankle injury. Those who had injured their ankles tended to weigh more, had greater limitations in their daily activities and were more likely to have cardiovascular or respiratory conditions than those who remained injury free.While ankle sprains are most common among physically active people, especially amateur and professional sports players and dancers, the general public is hardly immune. The injury can result from walking on an uneven surface (especially while wearing high heels or platform shoes), misstepping off a curb or staircase, being pulled erratically by a dog on a leash, even playing around in the yard with children or friends.It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take much. I know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 years ago, I sustained two bad sprains, one stepping on a stick while trimming a hedge and the other missing the last step while exiting a plane in the dark. I am now extremely careful about where I walk and what I put on my feet, especially when hiking in the woods (boots are de rigueur).Most ankle sprains result when the foot abruptly turns in under the leg so that the sole of that foot faces the opposite leg, unduly stretching the ligament on the outside of the ankle. The extent of the injury can range from a minor strain to a complete tear, and the rate and extent of healing can vary greatly.In one report to the athletic trainers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 convention, 12 college students who had sprained an ankle still had an incompletely healed, overstretched ligament a year after the injury, which \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay explain the high percentage of patients that develop chronic ankle instability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tricia Hubbard-Turner of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.As with any injury, ankle sprains are best prevented. One of the best approaches is to improve one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance with exercises that train the body to stay upright and maintain control in all kinds of positions. Dr. Gribble recommends spending time standing on one foot, at first on a firm surface, then with eyes closed, then on a soft surface like a pillow. As a final challenge, practice balancing on a wobble board, he said.Muscles surrounding the ankle can be strengthened by wrapping a towel around the foot for resistance, then moving the foot up, down, in and out. Do stretching exercises that increase the flexibility of the legs, hip and torso to guard against any unanticipated awkward movements.When participating in sports like basketball, soccer and tennis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which involve jumps or quick changes in direction that can put ankles at risk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 consider taping or bracing the ankles to increase their stability.Finally, avoid being a weekend warrior who indulges in a sport full tilt without adequate preparation. Build up gradually, practice the skills involved and make sure to keep needed muscles strong.Should you sprain an ankle, avoid the all too common layman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwalk it off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At a minimum, leave the game or whatever you were doing and avoid putting weight on that foot to give the injured joint adequate rest. If the injury is severe, you may need to use crutches.If you do sprain an ankle, apply ice wrapped in a cloth for 15 to 20 minutes every two or three hours for two days, then once a day until pain and swelling are gone. Sit or lie down as much as possible with the injured ankle elevated above the hip. To further minimize swelling, wrap the ankle in an elastic bandage, starting at the toes and working up to the leg.Seriously consider a medical consultation, especially if pain and swelling persist for more than a few days. Although in most cases, an X-ray or M.R.I. is not needed to make an accurate diagnosis, the injury could be more serious than a simple sprain. Ask about physical therapy, which can strengthen the joint and help prevent reinjury.Most important of all, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rush back into activity before healing is complete and normal, pain-free range of motion has been restored. Reinjuring the ankle can result in permanent pain and disability and the health consequences noted above.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Yahoo and the Online Universe According to Verizon", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStill, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is.It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations \u2014 advertisers \u2014 that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so.\u201cTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIt\u2019s to appeal to advertisers in a different way.\u201dAlready, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality.But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizon\u2019s existing assets \u2014 phone and data networks that knit together the nation \u2014 might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website \u201cfor the modern bride.\u201dLocation information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well \u2014 all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizon\u2019s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley.And Verizon is eager to change the narrative.Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizon\u2019s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce.Everything about the old-school street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become.Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160,000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans.That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike.This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits.That\u2019s why Lowell McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s empire retention,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and Pok\u00e9mon.It\u2019s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizon\u2019s main moneymaking activity \u2014 selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers.\u201cThere\u2019s not really any synergy between Verizon\u2019s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals.Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues.A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5.5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year.But other new ventures haven\u2019t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizon\u2019s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing.Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isn\u2019t clear. Though the companies aren\u2019t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldn\u2019t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the company\u2019s annual sales.\u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new,\u201d said Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. \u201cPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dMr. Armstrong\u2019s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizon\u2019s forays have already landed the company in hot water.The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew.\u201cThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,\u201d said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it.\u201dGiving advertisers access to smartphone users\u2019 data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesn\u2019t take many complaints to get hauled before the F.C.C.\u201dAnd in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a Verizon-owned site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. \u201cThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,\u201d Mr. Gillula said.Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a well-trafficked home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it co-owns Complex, a men\u2019s lifestyle website.Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted location-based advertising informed by the movements of Verizon\u2019s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the so-called internet of things \u2014 where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web \u2014 augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right industry.\u201dAdvertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. \u201cWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,\u201d said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks.\u201cAdvertisers want to make it work,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interest in supporting and propping up a well-run No. 3.\u201dYet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is \u201cwillful optimism,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger.At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1.2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers.And even if Verizon\u2019s push into digital media doesn\u2019t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo.For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,\u201d said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade.How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation.What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isn\u2019t clear.Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street.So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesn\u2019t regularly break out AOL\u2019s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Death, Qandeel Baloch, Pakistani Social Media Star, Is Celebrated as a Feminist Hero", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byAfter he was arrested on Saturday, the brother, Waseem Ahmed Azeem, said he had killed her because of the \u201cshameful\u201d pictures she had posted to Facebook.\u201cThis is a new weapon in the hands of Pakistani women,\u201d she said in a phone interview on Monday.There are hundreds of \u201chonor killings\u201d in Pakistan each year, and the assailants often go free because a legal loophole in the country allows the authorities not to prosecute a murder case if the victim\u2019s family forgives the killer.After a public outcry over Ms. Baloch\u2019s death, however, officials announced on Monday that the Azeem family would be barred from pardoning her killer. Women\u2019s rights advocates welcomed the move but said Pakistan should change the law to ban such pardons in all cases.The authorities also said they were investigating a high-ranking cleric, Mufti Abdul Qavi, who had appeared with Ms. Baloch in selfies taken in a hotel room last month. The photos prompted Mr. Qavi\u2019s removal from a religious committee that determines when Ramadan starts and ends based on the moon\u2019s sighting.Born Fauzia Azeem into a poor family in a small town in Punjab Province, Ms. Baloch said she was forced into marriage at age 17. According to new reports, she had a child who lives with her former husband. Her first foray into the public eye was a disastrous audition on \u201cPakistan Idol.\u201d She was escorted offstage by one of the hosts and ended the segment in tears.Her rejection from the mainstream entertainment industry spurred her to cultivate a following on social media with a mix of campy, sexy videos and messages about female empowerment. Speaking mostly in Urdu, she discussed topics like her crush on Imran Khan, the cricket star turned politician.\u201cShe\u2019s so self-made,\u201d said Ms. Zakaria. \u201cShe\u2019s taking bits and pieces she\u2019s seen in social media, in magazines. She\u2019s very much like the internet phenomenon anywhere. And people found her entertaining and liked her.\u201d\u201cShe was very titillating and the Pakistani men who found her titillating would not admit it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the bluff that she was calling out: You think I\u2019m so bad but you want me.\u201dThat also made her a lightning rod for criticism in a conservative society.\u201cMen would condemn her, but I\u2019m sure they were all secretly following her stuff on Instagram,\u201d he added.Ms. Baloch did not talk about her family or personal life in public. She had no handlers and no notable show business gigs.The petition rebuts the notion that Ms. Baloch was the country\u2019s Kim Kardashian: \u201cShe was our Qandeel: a working-class woman, a Third World feminist, a disrupter and a firebrand who dared to do as she pleased, despite threats to her life.\u201dAfter the scandal over the photos with Mr. Qavi, Ms. Baloch had revealed that she was receiving threats, and she appealed to Pakistan\u2019s Interior Ministry for protection.\u201cThey\u2019ve silenced her in a very public way to function as a deterrent,\u201d Ms. Zakaria said. \u201cBut when you consider the fact that there are millions of Qandeels out there sitting on their computers at night, in Karachi and Lahore and Multan, it\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s going to be more and more of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There was a knock on the door.\u201cCheryl, there are police here,\u201d the receptionist shouted. The staff assumed it was about a former employee. Two weeks earlier, a medical assistant had been fired when it was discovered she had been buying Percocet for the office and stealing it for her drug-dealer boyfriend.A SWAT team in military garb converged on Dr. Karcher. The receptionist started crying, and the office manager screamed, \u201cWait, you\u2019ve got the wrong girl.\u201dIt was not about a medical assistant. They did not have the wrong girl.She was led off in handcuffs and brought to the Police Department\u2019s 19th Precinct. A 50-count indictment, referring to activity that occurred two years earlier, charged criminal possession of a controlled substance, fraud and falsifying business records, and illegal dispersion of narcotics.Reporters were gathered outside, shouting: \u201cDoctor, did you steal the pills? Doctor, did you sell the pills? Who\u2019d you sell them to? What are you going to tell your patients?\u201d One police officer shielded her face from cameras with her Michael Kors bag.\u201cYou know, after that day, I threw out that outfit, and even that beautiful bag, which had been given to me as a gift. I just couldn\u2019t stand the association,\u201d she says, over tea at an Upper East Side diner (with the unfortunate name Midnight Express).In her late 50s, Dr. Karcher has the toned body of a lifelong athlete. She wears sheer makeup and sunscreen on her skin, and she touches me frequently as she talks. She is nervous. This is the first time she has discussed her arrest and its consequences publicly. She laughs at the suggestion this has made-for-TV-movie potential.\u201cYes, there are a lot of middle-aged actresses who\u2019d like to play a dermatologist taken in by a SWAT team,\u201d she says.There was no jail time. Instead of being adjudicated in criminal court, she was turned over to New York\u2019s Judicial Diversion program, without having to plead guilty and thus losing her medical license. She was allowed to attend a rehabilitation program while still seeing patients.Many have wondered how this was possible. Was Cheryl Karcher\u2019s punishment the kind of sweetheart deal accorded only the most privileged in our society? Or was it an entirely fair outcome, a reflection of society\u2019s changing attitudes toward substance abuse?Possibly it was both.At our meeting, Dr. Karcher is wearing a sleeveless blouse, and I ask her about a prominent scar on her shoulder. It turns out that over the course of three years, she had five surgeries, including a complete shoulder replacement. Those surgeries, she says, are when her problems began.At first she took Percocet for pain. Then she took Percocet for fun \u2014 \u201cor what I thought was fun,\u201d she says. She had a thriving practice, a relatively new marriage and, at that point in her early 50s, two children younger than five.\u201cSome people would have wine,\u201d she says. \u201cMe, I would come home and pop two Percocet. And then I\u2019d peel the apples to cook, clean the house, do the laundry, I\u2019d make my phone calls, write my papers. I\u2019d do everything I needed to do. Then I\u2019d crash. Next day, I\u2019d wake up, do it all again.\u201dThis went on for several years, she says. By 2012 Dr. Karcher knew she had a serious problem. She wanted help, but in addition to being addicted, she was ashamed. She didn\u2019t want to go to the New York Health Committee for Physician Health, a program funded by the Medical Society of the State of New York to identify and treat doctors with mental health or drug problems, she says, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want anybody to find out.\u201dNobody wants to admit defeat or weakness; but only doctors (and airline pilots) thought to have drug problems have such rigorous drug-testing programs, according to Terrance M. Bedient, the director of the Committee for Physician Health. Some lose their livelihoods temporarily, some permanently.At first Dr. Karcher told her husband, Duncan Karcher, she was addicted, but he didn\u2019t quite believe her. \u201cHe works in risk management, he\u2019s obsessive-compulsive about playing by the rules, but he just didn\u2019t understand,\u201d she says, because he didn\u2019t see her behaving oddly. It took a while for him to realize that Superwoman needed a fix.She tried to quit. Repeatedly. She failed. \u201cI tried so hard to do it myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI could cry when I think about it.\u201dDr. Karcher couldn\u2019t quite describe what it was like to go cold turkey, so I asked a friend who is a physician and is in the throes of quitting opiates, and who agreed to talk only if I did not name him. It\u2019s not just body aches and flulike symptoms.\u201cIt\u2019s the feeling that life is pointless, that there will never be joy again,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse is that it erases any memory of joy or even of the simple quotidian pleasures of everyday life.\u201d When my friend had written this to me in an email, he had stopped taking the methadone. A week later he was back on it and planning to spend a week by himself, leaving his friends and family \u201cbecause it is simply too horrible being around me\u201d during withdrawal.\u201cThis is a chronic, progressive and fatal disease,\u201d Dr. Karcher tells me. \u201cI have a friend of mine whose husband used to be an addict and she said, \u2018Cheryl, I really believe it would have been easier for him to kill himself than to get sober.\u2019\u201dGrowing up in Florida in a middle-class home that looked perfect on the outside but in reality was cold and tense, Cheryl was the family goody-two-shoes: great grades, great athlete and certainly no drugs, even though she went to the University of Florida (which has been ranked as one of the Top 10 Party Schools by The Princeton Review).\u201cI was afraid I\u2019d ruin my brain cells,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone was out at the movies. I was studying.\u201d She was published in The New England Journal of Medicine (an article on vitamin E and the way it permeates the skin) even before she was in medical school. \u201cA lot of stuff in my life has taken dedication,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about being undisciplined. I have a load of self-control.\u201dEnough, in fact, that when the SWAT team descended, Dr. Karcher had already been drug free for about a year and a half (a detail not reported in the articles about her arrest).Soon she was chairing weekly sessions of the group, and was the contact person for frightened newbies. It became, she says, \u201cmy secret life.\u201d\u201cCheryl was at every meeting, and I\u2019ve been going four years,\u201d says Reggie, a physician and an acquaintance of Dr. Karcher\u2019s who agreed to talk if he was allowed to maintain the anonymity provided in the recovery group. He treated his bipolar disorder with a variety of drugs, and had been hospitalized for attempted suicide. \u201cThe thing about addicts, and particularly those of us in medicine, is that we think we\u2019re somehow unique,\u201d Reggie says. \u201cWe are not unique, except maybe in our access to medication.\u201dStill, when she was arrested, Dr. Karcher was not 100 percent surprised. She always had a feeling this day might come. After all, even though she had not sold drugs, which eventually the narcotics office acknowledged, she had an office worker who did. \u201cOf course they thought I sold,\u201d Dr. Karcher says. \u201cIf I\u2019d been them, I would have thought so, too.\u201dBesides, even without the selling, hers was not a victimless crime. It was a form of identity theft. Citing privacy laws and the fact that the case is sealed, the New York City Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor would not put me in touch with the five people whose names Dr. Karcher mined for her own prescriptions.But with the change in the prescribing laws that require physicians to check a patient\u2019s controlled-substance records, these five people may have to explain to their future doctors why they were taking large quantities of Percocet (and Ambien and Adderall); they could be denied medications they actually need.And there was one thing Dr. Karcher did, she says, that was unforgivable: She got her nanny \u2014 a woman who was not a United States citizen and could hardly say no to her \u2014 to pick up prescriptions written in the nanny\u2019s name and hand over the medication to her. \u201cShe was a part of our family, and I never saw her again after the arrest,\u201d Dr. Karcher says. \u201cI go to bed many nights wishing I could apologize.\u201dThe post-arrest fallout was swift. Dr. Karcher had worked at Sadick Dermatology, a tony practice owned by Dr. Neil Sadick, with offices on Park Avenue, West 15th Street and on Long Island, and had to leave until her case was decided.She also lost her lucrative consulting contract with Avon and was devastated when, within a week, two dermatologists she considered good friends tried to take the job. One other consulting gig remained: She is the dermatologist with the Miss Universe Organization, recently sold by Donald Trump.\u201cWhen I saw what happened with her, my theory was that someone was trying to get publicity,\u201d says Paula Shugart, the president of the organization. \u201cI mean, why would there be media at the courthouse if someone hadn\u2019t alerted them?\u201dWhy stick by Dr. Karcher? \u201cFirst of all, We had a Miss USA who went to rehab in 2006, and Cheryl stood behind us,\u201d Ms. Shugart says. \u201cSecond, not to sound too clich\u00e9d, but we are an organization run by women that supports women, and standing up and doing what\u2019s right. This was a no-brainer for us.\u201dThe most painful memory of that time came when Dr. Karcher realized the effect on her children. Her daughter was too young to read the newspapers, and so would have been unaware were it not for the talk among friends\u2019 parents and older siblings.\u201cSoon after the arrest I was picking my daughter up from this little parade, and I heard her say, \u2018Where\u2019s my mommy?\u2019\u201d Dr. Karcher says. \u201cAnd I started to say, \u2018I\u2019m here, honey,\u2019 when the little girl standing next to her said, \u2018She\u2019s probably in jail.\u2019 And my daughter just lost it, crying and crying. Totally inconsolable.\u201dA few weeks after the arrest, the initial shock wore off. Word got out to patients and colleagues that Dr. Karcher was not the person in her office who had been selling drugs for money but indeed had had a drug problem herself. That\u2019s when empathy began to kick in.\u201cShe\u2019s so good, so professional,\u201d says Dr. Doris Day, a fellow dermatologist who considers Dr. Karcher a good friend. \u201cI felt guilty, like I had let her down because I never noticed anything was wrong.\u201dWendy Lewis, a plastic surgery consultant who has run physician practices, says: \u201cShe\u2019s someone I would never hesitate to recommend. She\u2019s not a salesperson, not greedy, not dishonest. You never heard an unkind word about her from other doctors, in the field where unkind words are the norm.\u201dBut with patients she already had, there was an enormous outpouring of support. \u201cYou have to understand, she took care of some of the most high-profile people in the city, in publishing and fashion,\u201d Dr. Neil Sadick says. \u201cAnd they loved her.\u201d\u201cWhen I heard about this, the first thing I did was write a letter to the judge,\u201d says Ronna Lichtenberg, a business strategist and author who had been a patient for several years. \u201cI have a lot of complex medical conditions, and often with doctors you have to choose between technical competence and bedside manner. With Cheryl, I didn\u2019t have to choose.\u201dWas writing these prescriptions stupid? Of course, Ms. Lichtenberg says, and patients gossiped about it. \u201cMaybe with another doctor, the end result would be different,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t surprise me that everyone I know is back. People have one question when something like this comes up: Are we safe? And the answer is yes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there is such a thing as a victimless crime, but this was about her personal pain,\u201d says Marie Komisar, the executive director of the National Association of Women Judges, who considers Dr. Karcher both her doctor and friend.\u201cI can tell you this: This is not a woman who\u2019s cavalier about drugs,\u201d Ms. Komisar says. \u201cA few years ago, I called Cheryl to try and prescribe some medication for my daughter, who has terrible migraines. We live in Washington, D.C. And it was a weekend. Cheryl was very apologetic, but wouldn\u2019t do it. She had never examined my daughter, and she was worried she could make something worse. I didn\u2019t want to go to the E.R., but we did, and I totally respected that decision.\u201d\u201cI went to her for all the usual cosmetic things, but this was different,\u201d says Dee Dee Ricks, a hedge fund consultant and cancer-patient advocate who documented her battle with breast cancer in the HBO special \u201cThe Education of Dee Dee Ricks.\u201dMs. Ricks had a blister on her toe that wouldn\u2019t go away. Another dermatologist had told her it was probably nothing, but if it didn\u2019t heal in a few weeks she should come in and have it examined again. Ms. Ricks ignored it. Then one day, she was seeing Dr. Karcher for a Botox session and mentioned the blister.\u201cCheryl looked at it, and I saw all the color drain out of her face,\u201d Ms. Ricks says. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s biopsy this right now,\u2019 Cheryl said. It turned out to be Stage 3 melanoma.\u201d Ms. Ricks lost her toe, but says \u201cCheryl saved my life.\u201dIn March 2015, Justice Richard M. Weinberg of the New York State Supreme Court ruled on Dr. Karcher\u2019s case: She could enter a drug-treatment program without pleading guilty to the charges (which would have forced her to lose her license). \u201cThe consequences to this doctor if I make her plea to the counts of indictment would be exceptional circumstances that could destroy her career and destroy her life with no redeeming value,\u201d Justice Weinberg said.The New York Post described the judge as \u201cstar-struck,\u201d and many saw the ruling as too lenient. Dr. Karcher is a pretty blond physician at the top of her game, with a lot of well-to-do clients. Would she have gotten this consideration if she weren\u2019t a person of means, or nonwhite, or both?Dr. Karcher is well aware of the advantages of her position and race: \u201cI was mistaken for a lawyer on more than one occasion.\u201d But at the same time, she thinks in her case her treatment had less to do with privilege and more to do with the fact that New York State is very much ahead of the curve in treatment of addicts who are not otherwise engaged in criminal behavior.\u201cI saw people with less privilege, less education, treated the same way I was,\u201d she says. \u201cThe judge in my case understood addiction so well. It\u2019s a disease.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re better people or better addicts,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the oversight board gives you more leverage\u201d over their behavior. Mr. Lamm treats a number of physicians at his Breathe Life Healing Center in West Hollywood, Calif., and says that given their access to opiates, he doesn\u2019t want to treat them unless an oversight board is involved. California doesn\u2019t have one like New York\u2019s; Mr. Lamm believes New York City should be the model nationwide.Dr. Karcher has nothing but praise for the Committee for Physicians Health and the Office of Professional Medical Misconduct, which oversees medical malfeasance. \u201cSomebody has to look out for the public interest,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, when I went up to see them in Albany, they asked, \u2018Have you ever been arrested?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Are you kidding me? A SWAT team came to my office!\u2019 and the woman said, \u2018I know, but believe it or not I\u2019ve had doctors look me in the eye and say no.\u2019\u201dDr. Karcher is unequivocal that doctors who are using should lose their licenses, but there has to be a road back. \u201cSome states are more progressive, more understanding and more educated than others,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody asks for this disease. Nobody wants to be addicted. But the good news is there\u2019s a way out. And it can really turn a life into one of great gratitude, humility and joy. I wouldn\u2019t trade my life for anyone else\u2019s.\u201dIt\u2019s been a lesson not just in breaking addiction, she says, but in overcoming shame. She had to fight the urge to isolate herself, to disappear from friends and colleagues and wallow.These days, Dr. Karcher is not only back in the white-on-white office of Dr. Sadick, but she has also opened her own practice, offering \u201cbespoke cosmetic care\u201d in the Fifth Avenue digs of Dr. Virginia Wade, an anesthesiologist for plastic surgeons. It was Dr. Wade who took her in when no one else would. Even Dr. Sadick, her champion, would not let her practice in his office until she was cleared of all charges.\u201cHer story was so familiar to me,\u201d says Dr. Wade, who points out that there are many addicted people in health care.

{"Headline": "Verizon Is Said to Be Near a Deal to Acquire Yahoo", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The end of Yahoo as an independent company may be near, and Verizon \u2014 long considered the leading contender to buy the aging web pioneer \u2014 is the most likely acquirer.The two companies are in advanced talks over a takeover of Yahoo that could be worth close to $5 billion, a person briefed on the matter said Friday.Any transaction would be for Yahoo\u2019s core internet business, although it is unclear whether a deal would also include other assets like real estate or patents.Both companies are hoping to announce a deal as early as next week, this person said. Verizon is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday.Bankers for Yahoo cast a wide net for the auction, and a number of potential suitors emerged. The field was winnowed down to a handful of bidders, which included AT&T; private equity firms like TPG Capital; and the Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert, who has received the backing of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway.But people involved in the process long believed that Verizon, with its enormous cash pile and its ability to wring out efficiencies by merging Yahoo with AOL, was the most likely winner.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, said that combining AOL with Yahoo would create a stronger No. 3 digital platform for online advertising, after Google and Facebook.\u201cThis is a 1 plus 1 equals 2\u00bd,\u201d he said.No final deal has been reached and the talks could still falter, the person briefed on the matter cautioned. One of the other finalists in the Yahoo auction process could also re-emerge with a higher bid.Yahoo would bring in a huge amount of additional news, sports and finance content \u2014 and the one billion people a month who visit Yahoo services \u2014 and would offer Verizon another set of sophisticated ad technologies.Yahoo\u2019s BrightRoll division in particular is a leader in delivering automated, real-time advertising, and could be merged with AOL\u2019s ad technology to deliver more appealing options to marketers, particularly in video.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be anybody\u2019s first port of call,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cBut they will have a deeper set of data than anyone except Facebook and Google.\u201dThat prospect alarms privacy advocates but elates marketers.\u201cGoogle has access to me on my mobile phone but is kind of missing the cable box and internet access data that Verizon has,\u201d said Shar VanBoskirk, a digital marketing analyst at the research firm Forrester.Consumers feel warmly about Yahoo as a brand, Ms. VanBoskirk said, even if they do not use many Yahoo services. By contrast, she added, \u201cpeople have a pretty negative attitude towards telecom.\u201d She said Verizon could rebrand some of its services with the Yahoo name to increase their appeal.Any purchase of Yahoo carries some real risks, however. In addition to the F.C.C. rules that would make the data sharing less valuable, integrating ad platforms is a complex challenge, usually plagued with delays. The companies also have a different incentive structure for their advertising sales forces, according to Mr. Wieser, and unifying them could be disruptive.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trumpian Dreams of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThere were more than a few dropped jaws when the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel agreed to a prime-time speaking slot on the final night of the Republican National Convention, barely an hour before the acceptance speech of Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump wants to emboss a big fat T on government, promising huge infrastructure projects, starting with a wall between the United States and Mexico. What was a former Ron Paul supporter and proud libertarian like Mr. Thiel doing on the same stage?Mr. Thiel\u2019s endorsement puts him at odds with many Silicon Valley chief executives and investors who oppose Mr. Trump on issues like climate change, same-sex marriage and, of course, immigration (they want more visas available for software engineers). It is easy to depict Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, board member at Facebook and influential investor, as an outlier even in the oddball tech world: He believes there will be a cure for death, promotes the construction of floating islands exempt from society\u2019s rules and secretly financed a lawsuit to take down Gawker.But Mr. Thiel isn\u2019t just embedded in the business of Silicon Valley. He\u2019s also deeply embedded in the worldview of Silicon Valley that, despite many disagreements with the Republican platform, matches up surprisingly well with Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas about fixing government.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.For these companies, government regulation is the enemy when it fails to appreciate the genius of their schemes and tries to slow them with Old World concerns over safety, privacy or copyright infringement. They are also now coming under scrutiny for their lack of diversity. The fantasy of the early web \u2014 a world without color or sex \u2014 fostered a belief that the world was largely past issues like inequality. Companies that strive for greatness, some argue now, naturally seek out employees with elite backgrounds. Larry Page of Google could have been speaking for many in the Valley when he said that from the start, \u201cWe just hired people like us.\u201dBut Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t hate government categorically. When Mr. Thiel harked back to the great projects of the past, like building the atom bomb, creating the internet and landing a man on the moon, he was citing three of the most important United States government initiatives of the last century. He praised them in his speech for inspiring the tech dreamers of Silicon Valley, who today inspire America to be great again.Believing in greatness \u2014 especially great ambitious projects \u2014 is what Mr. Thiel and Mr. Trump have in common. After all, what is the border wall but a giant undertaking, like the Washington Monument or the Hoover Dam, except that, Mr. Trump insists, it will pay for itself? By nominating Mr. Trump, Republican primary voters have abruptly left behind the party that believes in Ronald Reagan\u2019s gospel that \u201cgovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d It is now firmly in the camp that believes that when it comes to certain issues, \u201conly government can do this\u201d or, in Mr. Trump\u2019s phrase, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201dMr. Trump claims this because he is a builder whom we can trust to get things done. Mr. Thiel comes from Silicon Valley, where the belief in talent, and the rewards owed to talent, are paramount. \u201cMy industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software, and, of course, it\u2019s made a lot of money,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to someone like Mr. Thiel is that they both believe that government should be brash and bold, while politics as usual produces tame mediocrity. They also believe they are the right kind of people to change that.Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

Having gotten his start in Washington in Senator John Kerry\u2019s press office through an internship at the College of the Holy Cross, Mr. Favreau, at 22, was suddenly charged with the excruciating task of informing the senatorial candidate from Illinois that he had to remove a rousing line from his keynote address that Senator Kerry wanted to use. Mr. Obama was not pleased, but he made the change.Mr. Favreau joined Mr. Obama\u2019s team a year later, and in 2009, he became the second-youngest chief White House speechwriter in history.With his Ben Affleck smile and smidgen of a Mass Pike accent to match (he grew up just outside Boston, in Winchester), Mr. Favreau made the gossip pages with uncomfortable regularity.Over old-fashioneds at Soho House West Hollywood, the private members\u2019 club down the block from his apartment (\u201cThis is sort of my second office,\u201d he said), Mr. Favreau appeared fit and happy in a gray T-shirt, jeans and crisp maroon Vans.The go-go life that had him on call 24/8 in Washington has given way to staring at his phone while in gym clothes yelling about Trump University. \u201cI decided to write for The Ringer partly because it gives me a platform, but also because people come dressed to work, and it\u2019s not just my goldendoodle I\u2019m talking to,\u201d he said.His circle in general is tighter than it once was.

Sixteen did, and the result is \u201cFreedom.\u201d What follows are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Carmon.What led you to create this work?After our Lincoln Center season, I went home on our break \u2014 I\u2019m from Texas \u2014 and taught dance classes in Houston and the surrounding areas. My students weren\u2019t being challenged, and I wanted to do something different, so that\u2019s how this started. Before I knew it, it had kind of taken on a life of its own.\u201cFreedom\u201d comes from your classroom material?Yes. I\u2019ve done several different versions. Then everything went down in our nation last week. The company was on tour in Saratoga Springs, and I noticed a lot of our dancers were clearly in some type of emotional duress. As the dance progressed, it allowed me to release a lot of my emotions, so I proposed it to the company: If anyone wants to come and dance whatever you\u2019re feeling out, we have 30 minutes \u2014 let\u2019s have that moment so we can leave it in the studio and take our fresh selves to the stage.Why did you shoot it in black and white?I based it on Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cRhythm Nation.\u201d Every shade of brown, tan, white \u2014 we\u2019re all gray in black and white.Did you get Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s permission?Do you have plans for it to become part of a bigger piece?That is the hope. This has put a seed, not even in the back of my mind, but somewhere in the middle. I can feel it starting to sprout. The more classes I teach, I\u2019ll probably use my students as guinea pigs and start to build upon it brick by brick. Eventually I\u2019ll have a house. Hopefully.Toward the end of \u201cFreedom,\u201d the dancers separate and perform brief, improvised solos. What were your instructions?I have two sets: One for my students and another for the Ailey dancers. I told the students: \u201cYou have this much time. This is the rhythm. Don\u2019t go to the melody; it should be sharp, staccato, free, fluid. I don\u2019t need to see tilts, I don\u2019t need to see fouett\u00e9 turns, I don\u2019t need to see your tricks. I want you to release something from inside of you. And if you don\u2019t have anything? Pretend.\u201dI gave the dancers in the company the same rhythmic objective and told them: \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you a single thing about what you should do. We all know what\u2019s going on in our country. We all have our visceral responses to it. I\u2019m going to put the music on. Give me everything you have.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened.Advertisement"}

The tech overlords keep clear of writers who are not on their payrolls or at least in their thrall. Many in the valley feel that bringing the digital future to the masses is God\u2019s work. Question this, and they tend to get touchy. Anger them, and they might seek revenge. The billionaire investor Peter Thiel, outed by the local arm of the Gawker media empire, secretly financed a lawsuit to destroy it. Silicon Valley did not rise en masse and say this was seriously beyond the pale. No surprise, then, that there are so few books investigating what it really takes to succeed in tech (duplicity often trumps innovation) or that critically examine such omnipresent, comforting fables as \u201cWe\u2019re not in it for the money.\u201dThere are other barriers to literature. A start-up is less a physical reality than the hype that surrounds it. (It\u2019s not lying if you believe it.) Boasts, threats, secret deals, betrayals are the coin of the realm, but lawsuits and news releases are the only things put in writing. Nailing this slippery culture would take an unholy combination of David Mamet and Tom Wolfe in their primes, but they would also have to be lucky enough to find a subject who did not realize he was a great subject and start censoring himself for fear he would never be hired again. Good luck with that.In the meantime, we have the next best thing: Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s \u201cChaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,\u201d a book whose bland all-purpose title belies the fact that this is a valley account like no other. The first hint that something is different here comes with the dedication: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d This is autobiography as revenge, naming names and sparing few, certainly not the author. \u201cI was wholly devoid of most human boundaries or morality,\u201d he notes in passing. In other words, he was a start-up chief executive.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez came to the valley in 2008 from Goldman Sachs, where he was a pricing quant who modeled credit derivatives. In the valley, he tried to do the same with chunks of human attention, which meant inventing digital ad systems. He started at a flailing firm named \u00adAdchemy; quit with two engineers to found a start-up; sold the start-up to Twitter but went himself to work for Facebook, where he lasted two years.Flatly summarized, it is not a very interesting career. The start-up, named AdGrok, was a company mostly in name; it was three guys in a dumpy room trying to hustle themselves in a world full of hustlers. The answer to the problem plaguing Facebook during Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s stint there \u2014 how can we use digital advertising to make some serious money? \u2014 was not solved by the author.No matter. Michael Lewis was never a top Wall Street bond salesman, but in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d he captured an era. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d aims to do the same for Silicon Valley, and bracingly succeeds. Nothing I\u2019ve ever read conveys better what it actually is like to be in the engine room of the start-up economy. There were moments I laughed out loud, something I never recall doing while reading about Steve Jobs. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez shows how a start-up is less about making a product that actually does something than desperately demonstrating you are worthy of being hired by Google, Twitter or Facebook. He describes the way the big companies resemble life in Cuba or Communist China circa 1965, with \u201cendless toil motivated by lapidary ideals handed down by a revered and unquestioned leader,\u201d not to mention the posters on the wall proclaiming, \u201cProceed and Be Bold!\u201d This is a place, he points out, where people take their laptops into a toilet stall and keep typing as they do what they came to do. If that strikes you as unseemly or unnecessary, you\u2019ll never make it in Palo Alto.The heart of the book is the period Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez spent at his start-up, which was intended to allow small businesses to efficiently advertise on Google. It was an auspicious moment. While the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the recession, the office parks of the valley were full of aggressive young men who had made pots of money by being early employees of Google. To prove they were not merely lucky, they needed to score again. Everyone was terrified of missing the next Facebook or, a little later, the next Airbnb or Uber. Smart entrepreneurs capitalized on these fears.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s big break was hyping his way into Y Combinator, in effect the valley\u2019s finishing school for innovators. He labels the YC entrepreneur profile as \u201cbomb-throwing anarchist subversive mixed with coldblooded execution mixed with irreverent whimsy, a sort of \u00adtechnology-enabled 12-year-old boy.\u201d He fit right in.Graduation from Y Combinator conveys the same prestige that a degree from Harvard does back East, and comes complete with an old boy \u2014 well, young men \u2014 network that is handy in all sorts of ways. \u201cAnyone who claims the valley is meritocratic is someone who has profited vastly from it via nonmeritocratic means like happenstance, membership in a privileged cohort or some concealed act of absolute skulduggery,\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez observes. All three helped AdGrok; at one point the author manipulated the numbers for his investors, \u201ccooking the books in the worst form. But it was either that or give up now, and surrender was unthinkable.\u201dThere are a few problems with \u201cChaos Monkeys.\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez likes footnotes way too much (on one page there are four) and the epigraphs to each chapter are numbingly heavy-handed, although the Latin American proverb about how for every beautiful woman there\u2019s a man tired of making love to her sums up nicely his feelings about leaving the Kingdom of Facebook. More problematically, there is much more about digital ad technology here than most readers could possibly want. The implications of the technology, on the other hand, are somewhat scanted.\u201cImagine that every time you go to CNN.com, it\u2019s as though a new sell order for one share in your brain is transmitted to a stock exchange,\u201d he writes. \u201cPicture it: Individual quanta of human attention sold, bit by bit, like so many million shares of General Motors stock, billions of times a day.\u201d That was the world Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was doing his best to create.

{"Headline": "To Stem Obesity, Start Before Birth", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.To stem the current epidemic of obesity, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no arguing with the adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As every overweight adult knows too well, shedding excess pounds and keeping them off is far harder than putting them on in the first place.But assuring a leaner, healthier younger generation may often require starting even before a baby is born.The overwhelming majority of babies are lean at birth, but by the time they reach kindergarten, many have acquired excess body fat that sets the stage for a lifelong weight problem.Recent studies indicate that the reason so many American children become overweight is far more complicated than consuming more calories than they burn, although this is certainly an important factor. Rather, preventing children from acquiring excess body fat may have to start even before their mothers become pregnant.In the usual weight trajectory, children are born lean, get chubby during infancy, then become lean again as toddlers when they grow taller and become more active. Then, at or before age 10 or so, body fat increases in preparation for puberty \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a phenomenon called adiposity rebound.In children with obesity genes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cadiposity rebound occurs earlier and higher,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Daniel W. Belsky, an epidemiologist at Duke University School of Medicine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey stop getting leaner sooner and start putting on fat earlier and put on more of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStill, twin and family studies have shown that many children with these genes remain lean. Furthermore, these same genes were undoubtedly around in the 1960s and 1970s when the obesity rate in children was a fraction of what it is today.So what is different about the 2000s? Children today are surrounded by a surfeit of unwholesome, easy-to-consume calorie-dense foods and snacks accompanied by a deficit of opportunities to expend those extra calories through regular physical activity. And countering a calorie-rich, sedentary environment is now harder than it should be, with the current heavy emphasis on academics, parental reluctance to let children play outside unattended, and intense competition from electronics. All these circumstances may give obesity genes a greater chance to express themselves.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also essential that parents model good eating habits, experts agree. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you do it, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d David S. Ludwig, an obesity specialist at Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital Boston, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung children are like ducklings, they want to do what their mothers do.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEqually important, Dr. Belsky said, is \u00e2\u0080\u009callowing children in institutional settings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in day care, preschool and elementary school \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to be as active as they choose to be rather than forcing them to sit quietly in chairs most of the day. Being physically active encourages a healthy metabolism. Active children are not constantly hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the face of the obesity epidemic, eliminating the handful of opportunities for kids to be active during the day is a shame. Sedentary behavior becomes a life pattern.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs Dr. Ludwig explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough genes are not modifiable, the weight of the mother before and during pregnancy is. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy predicts not just the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birth weight but also the likelihood of obesity in middle childhood.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost, though not all, studies have linked a longer duration of breast-feeding to a reduced risk of overweight in children. Although Dr. Ludwig said that the effect \u00e2\u0080\u009cis not dramatic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a more important benefit of breast-feeding may be \u00e2\u0080\u009cexposing the baby to a wider range of tastes based on what a mother is eating. If a breast-feeding mom eats a large variety of nutritious foods, the child is more likely to like them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEven if children have already started on a path of poor eating habits and excess weight gain, Dr. Ludwig said it is not too late to make healthful changes. As founder of the Optimal Weight for Life program and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnding the Food Fight: Guide Your Child to a Healthy Weight in a Fast Food/Fake Food World,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he advocates an authoritative, but not an authoritarian, parenting style that eliminates stress and conflict over what and when a child eats.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever force food on a child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he insists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand your ground in a gentle but firm way and be prepared to do a little negotiating. When a child refuses to eat the dinner that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s served, put it away in the fridge to be eaten later. If the child says \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to eat it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the response should be, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fine, just go to bed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 not \u00e2\u0080\u0098O.K., I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make you mac and cheese.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009cChildren should be allowed to control their bodies, but parents have to provide the guidance and control the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Ludwig said.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Smile for the Phone, Creep", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byI Was MisinformedI was assaulted the other evening when I was strolling along the High Line. Maybe groped is the more physically accurate word, but given the nature of the violation and the feelings of anger and helplessness it kicked off, I can\u2019t help considering it an assault.It happened a little after 7 p.m. on a brutally humid evening, but a promising one.I was walking home from an art opening in my favorite hot-weather dress, enjoying the deep summer scent of the gardens, thinking about going to a bar in Brooklyn that promised rowdy opera \u2014 horned helmets optional, the website says. Really, is there anything you can\u2019t find in New York on a summer night? I see three teenage boys, maybe ages 13 or 14, walking in my direction. Suddenly I feel a hand shoot up my skirt and a kid grabs the outside of my thigh. There\u2019s laughter. Then the kids run off.You know the lightning responses you see in action movies when an attack takes place? Huh? Was that a hand on my thigh? That hand was under my dress.I turn around to see where the creep has gone and see him and his two buddies half a block away. They aren\u2019t running, they\u2019re looking over the rail, scoping out the crowd. I see no police officers. Obviously I\u2019m going to have to take justice in my own hands.\u201cCREEP!\u201d I yell.The kids sneer.Then I remember what the modern victim is supposed to do: Get a photo. I open the flap of my cross-body bag; unzip the phone pouch; try to unlock my phone with a sweaty fingerprint \u2014 and fail, because wet hands mess up the ID; punch in my security code; swipe through the icons for the camera; find it; and aim. By which time the kids have, of course, disappeared.You know those assault horror stories that have exploded this summer? Women groped on subways; perverts exposing themselves; black drivers pulled over and terrorized by the police; officers murdered by snipers.What has amazed me about these crimes is the ability of many victims or passers-by to quickly grab their phones and get a photo. Or live-stream the attackers on Facebook. America is a country of quick-draw artists, with apps instead of guns.But not me. I am, I realize, one of those helpless townspeople who after years of being terrorized by a gang of sneering bandits, would have to hire a gunman. Clint Eastwood, say, in a remake of \u201cHigh Plains Drifter\u201d \u2014 call it \u201cHigh Line Drifter.\u201dClint would not be oblivious to how I look in my favorite summer dress either.\u201cYou know a good place for fried chicken?\u201d Clint would ask me, as the kid begged for mercy. \u201cI like fried chicken.\u201dThen Clint would drop the creep on 10th Avenue and there would be a public outcry and his lone-gunslinger license would be suspended and I would still not have a boyfriend.Where was I?Oh, yeah, my inability to handle a locked and loaded cellphone. Obviously I needed to brush up on my technological skill set, which means rounding up a young person. The ones I rely on are my nieces, Caity and Freyja. They tell me which printer to get and why I should not be on Tinder. (S.T.D.s, and people don\u2019t actually use it to find someone to have dinner with in a strange town.) I consult with Caity. She is horrified when she hears about the High Line incident and immediately gives me some fast-draw basics.\u201cWhen you grab your phone, it\u2019s probably going to be locked, but there\u2019s a camera icon on the lower right,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to unlock it to use the camera. Just swipe up and you\u2019re ready to go.\u201dI had never noticed a pale gray camera icon on my phone; it\u2019s lost in a pale gray corner of my home screen, but when I put on my reading glasses I see it. And since sometimes there is a different screen and the camera icon does not appear, Caity shows me a bar at the bottom of the phone I can swipe upward. That brings up several icons, including the camera still in the lower right.Live-streaming on Facebook takes longer on my phone. When Caity opens the app, a \u201cGo Live\u201d button appears on the upper-left corner of the screen. Although I have the same phone, I have no such tab. I have to take an extra step going first to my page, then opening the \u201cWhat\u2019s On Your Mind\u201d tab to find the \u201cGo Live\u201d button. I see on the web that other people are having this problem. Further research is required.But I have the basics. You know the way people practice their aim in the Westerns, shooting bottles off the fence? That\u2019s me, metaphorically, with my phone. I\u2019ve moved it to a more accessible pocket of my bag, and walking through Union Square, I sometimes practice my draw.Bam! Bam! Gotcha, Gandhi statue!I may not be as fast as a 17-year-old, but I can confidently say there\u2019s a new sheriff in town. And if I see another creep in action, this time I will get him.I Was Misinformed is a humor column about survival in New York City. Any resemblance to persons alive or dead is your own fault.

{"Headline": "On Eve of G.O.P. Convention, Law and Order Takes the Floor", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byA string of shootings targeting police officers, as well as the recent killings of two black men by police officers in Minnesota and Louisiana, had already pushed gun violence and social unrest to the center of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has campaigned on the theme of \u201claw and order\u201d since the assassination this month of five police officers in Dallas, and he is likely to amplify that message in the coming days.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has long battled criticism of his volcanic temper and questions about his temperament and readiness for the presidency, and it was unclear if a thunderous response to the shooting in Louisiana will help allay voters\u2019 concerns. While Republicans often run on law-and-order themes, an indelicate approach could carry considerable danger at a moment of such unusual political instability.In Cleveland, the killings of the police have set a tense atmosphere for the convention: Well before the bloodshed in Baton Rouge, organizers were preparing extensively for mass demonstrations and potential unrest.\u201cThis has got everybody on edge,\u201d said Tony Perkins, a former state legislator from Baton Rouge who is the leader of the Family Research Council, a conservative group. \u201cThe nation is in shock. If it were an isolated incident, probably not so much so, but this is the second in two weeks.\u201dAnxiety about security in Cleveland grew throughout the day on Sunday, as an official with a police union in the city urged Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, to enact restrictions on gun rights around the convention zone as an additional safety precaution. Mr. Kasich\u2019s office rejected the idea as legally impossible.Roger F. Villere Jr., the chairman of the Louisiana Republican Party, said word of the attack in Baton Rouge early Sunday had sent a shudder through the state\u2019s delegation in Cleveland. Mr. Villere, whose party office is in Baton Rouge, said he had been attending church on Sunday morning in suburban Mayfield, Ohio, when text messages and phone calls began pouring into his phone.Many members of the Louisiana delegation had close ties to law enforcement, Mr. Villere said, and they would seek to put together a memorial event or moment of prayer this week.A sense of loyalty to law enforcement has pervaded the convention: On Saturday night and on Sunday in Cleveland\u2019s Fourth Street district, restaurant patrons seated on the sidewalk repeatedly broke into applause for the phalanxes of police officers who filed down the street on foot and on bicycles.And the convention was likely to begin with a trumpeting of support for police officers. Convention organizers said on Sunday that the theme of the first day, Monday, would be \u201cMake America Safe Again.\u201dJeff Larson, the convention\u2019s chief executive, said in a news conference that a leading speaker would be Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom he described as \u201cthe law-and-order mayor of New York.\u201dMr. Trump was not slated to speak until later in the week, but on Sunday he embraced even more tightly a dire message about social disorder.After spending the first part of the day lobbing insults at his political rivals through social media, Mr. Trump abruptly shifted his posture after the attack in Baton Rouge, dropping his customary complaints about television news coverage and taunts directed at Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren.In an afternoon message posted to Facebook, Mr. Trump expressed grief over the loss of life. Without elaborating, he said the violence stemmed from a national leadership vacuum.\u201cHow many law enforcement and people have to die because of a lack of leadership in our country?\u201d he said. \u201cWe demand law and order.\u201dAfter the release of a carefully worded statement, Mr. Trump shared words of hot anger on Twitter, saying that the country was \u201cdivided and out of control.\u201dThe city is expecting 35,000 to 50,000 protesters a day during the Democratic National Convention.In downtown Cleveland, security precautions were everywhere: Tall metal barriers lined the roads around the Quicken Loans Arena, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to receive the Republican nomination on Thursday. With only light afternoon traffic in the vicinity of the convention, police officers and Secret Service agents seemed on some corners to outnumber pedestrians.The first protests on Sunday were relatively subdued. In one park in eastern Cleveland, about 100 protesters gathered \u2014 alongside nearly as many members of the media \u2014 from groups that included Black Lives Matter, Code Pink and a pro-Palestinian organization.Cleveland has assigned about 500 police officers specifically to handle the convention, and it has brought in thousands more officers to help, from departments as distant as California and Texas.But some local officials have expressed concern about the possibility of violence owing to Ohio\u2019s open-carry gun laws. Though demonstrators and others in the convention district have been barred from possessing a range of items, including gas masks, there was no prohibition on the brandishing of firearms.On Sunday, the president of Cleveland\u2019s police union called for additional measures to protect the security of the event, and urged Mr. Kasich to suspend open-carry gun rights. The governor\u2019s office said Mr. Kasich did not have \u201cthe power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws.\u201dThere was little evidence of firearms around the convention center, though journalists swarmed a lone man, Steve Thacker, who wandered into Public Square, a few blocks away, with a semiautomatic rifle strapped to his back and a handgun at his side.In addition to Mr. Giuliani, the Trump campaign and convention organizers have announced the names of several prominent convention speakers who were closely identified with law enforcement. Among them was David Clarke Jr., the sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wis., and an ardent advocate for gun rights, who will speak on Monday.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination on his own law-and-order message, was also scheduled to speak.But in Baton Rouge, Woody Jenkins, the Trump campaign\u2019s state chairman in Louisiana, said he was unsure how closely the national political debate would touch the community. Mr. Jenkins, a newspaper editor and local Republican leader, said he had seen a \u201ctremendous outpouring of brotherhood\u201d in Baton Rouge over the past few weeks, and little mention of the presidential race.Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmessage of supporting law and order, I think, is a good one,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cAnd I think the message of, \u2018We want justice and peace,\u2019 from a lot on the Democratic side \u2014 that\u2019s good as well. Why can\u2019t we have both?\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Times Reporter Descends Into Pok\u00e9mania", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byReporter\u2019s NotebookI never liked Pok\u00e9mon as a kid.The game I played almost nonstop from Friday to Sunday was not the Pok\u00e9mon I grew up with. This was Pok\u00e9mon Go, an augmented-reality smartphone app that has captured the minds and playful spirits of millions worldwide.The game is not incredibly complex. You\u2019re asked to create a character \u2014 a Pok\u00e9mon trainer with a semi-customizable avatar \u2014 and essentially do the same thing you were doing in the Pok\u00e9mon of old: Collect as many monsters as you can, wherever you can.The twist is: The monsters are let loose in the real world, spread across a digitally mapped overlay of your surroundings (based on Google\u2019s mapping service). Users capture Pok\u00e9mon that pop up at random on the map by pointing their smartphone cameras at them and tossing \u201cPok\u00e9 Balls\u201d until the monsters are subdued.Despite its age (the first iteration appeared in Japan more than 20 years ago), Pok\u00e9mon has never really gone away. The game and its many licenses and forms still rake in about $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually.But Pok\u00e9mon Go feels like something altogether different. I\u2019m not gaming inside my living room, playing on a console from my couch. I\u2019m out in parks with throngs of people of all ages, climbing over hills and seeing landmarks I hadn\u2019t otherwise paid attention to before.Even on the block outside of my house, I\u2019m meeting players who live in my neighborhood. I\u2019ve run into one man and his boyfriend three times over the weekend, and they\u2019ve consistently given me tips on the locations of rare nearby Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019ve gotten a few knowing winks and nods from others, too, as if to say we are both part of some open secret, searchers in the real world.I can foresee certain perils. Phone theft is all too common in San Francisco, and traversing Golden Gate Park or wandering through dark parking lots at midnight is not a good idea when you aren\u2019t gaming, much less when you\u2019re carrying an $800 smartphone. Crime will happen, people will do stupid things \u2014 and they\u2019ll make headlines as novelty news.But I can\u2019t help admitting, somewhat reluctantly, the fun I had wandering around my city, catching these goofy monsters and talking to other people about how to do it. Even though I didn\u2019t play much as a kid, Pok\u00e9mon is a cultural touchstone of my youth, something that stoked a sense of nostalgia \u2014 and something I suddenly became invested in.I found myself being advised by a 15-year-old, conversing with people my age and interacting with folks much older than I. (Another perk: After being outside in the California sun for three days, I got quite a nice tan.)It\u2019s difficult to tell if the fervor will last. Smartphone games have a tendency to rise quickly and fall just as fast, a hits-driven business built on the promise of the sequel. I could see the masses moving on to the next big thing as the summer comes to an end, or perhaps when their legs begin to tire from walking more than they\u2019re used to.But for now, I am happy with this new little world, and happy to be a part of a nerdy club where I can go up to someone else on the street and ask, \u201cHave you seen that nearby Snorlax?\u201d without being considered mentally ill.I\u2019ll take it \u2014 at least, until the next thing comes and captures everyone\u2019s attention.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Drops Snark in Favor of Emotion to Undercut Extremists", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration has revamped a program designed to lure foreign fighters away from extremist groups like the Islamic State, focusing on a series of new advertisements and social media posts that seek to appeal to emotion rather than logic.Money for the program, which is managed by the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center, tripled this year, to $16 million, after administration officials concluded that past efforts that had attempted to scare potential militants away from the extremist groups were not working.But one thing has changed from similar efforts in the past. The new initiatives have been tailored to keep the United States government\u2019s involvement as low-key \u2014 and in some cases, as secretive \u2014 as possible, because overt American backing for some projects had turned off the exact group of disaffected young men that the campaign is trying to reach.These new efforts include using Facebook videos, Instagram ads and other social media that have been designed to convince young men and women that joining the militants\u2019 fight means breaking their mothers\u2019 hearts, tearing apart their families and leaving their loved ones to lives of emptiness.Past efforts from the administration had sought to frighten potential jihadists with warnings that waging war against the West would get them killed, but officials concluded that the warnings actually served the opposite purpose of glorifying militancy.Many of the previous programs were overtly tied to the United States government, including one video, branded as part of the State Department\u2019s \u201cThink Again, Turn Away\u201d program, called \u201cWelcome to the Islamic State Land.\u201d The graphic video, which shows beheadings, crucifixions and executions by firing squad, is full of ominous music and sarcastic commentary. \u201cRun, do not walk, to ISIS,\u201d the English subtitle says, telling fighters they will be taught useful skills.Examples of these skills, the video says, include \u201cBlowing up mosques! Crucifying and executing Muslims! Plundering public resources! Suicide bombings inside mosques! Travel is inexpensive because you won\u2019t need a return ticket.\u201dThe video ends with \u201cThink Again, Turn Away,\u201d and the seal of the State Department.Michael Lumpkin, a former member of the Navy SEALs who was sent by President Obama from the Pentagon to the State Department in January to overhaul the program, turned to a reporter after playing the \u201cThink Again, Turn Away\u201d video recently. \u201cHow did that make you feel?\u201d he asked. The answer, he said, was that the video leaves the viewer annoyed at its smug sarcasm rather than appalled at the horrific images on the screen.The video\u2019s American branding, he added, destroys any chance that a potential foreign fighter would be persuaded to turn away. \u201cWe\u2019re not the most credible messenger,\u201d Mr. Lumpkin said.The State Department launched the \u201cThink Again, Turn Away\u201d campaign in December 2013, but the outreach effort quickly came under sharp criticism from terrorism experts who said that in addition to emboldening terrorist groups it burnished their social media presence on Twitter and Facebook.On Sept. 11, 2014, for example, a Qaeda leader posted on Twitter that \u201con this day, in 2001, the USA\u2019s largest economic shrine, the idol of capitalism was brought to the ground.\u201d The State Department quickly responded on Twitter by posting a photo of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader, wearing a Rolex watch: \u201cNobody\u2019s a bigger fan of the fruits of capitalism than so-called #ISIS Caliph.\u201dThe response, critics said, only legitimized the original message on Twitter, and was unlikely to have done anything to dissuade young people from joining either Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.\u201cApart from the fact that the U.S. government shouldn\u2019t do snark, it\u2019s not persuasive,\u201d said Richard Stengel, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re not the most effective messenger for our message. There\u2019s no tweet from the U.S. State Department that\u2019s going to talk a young man out of joining ISIS.\u201dMr. Lumpkin was more descriptive. Such Twitter messages, he said, were \u201clike wrestling with a pig. The pig likes it, and you get dirty.\u201dThe administration is now working with organizations overseas to get out the message without an American imprint, including the Sawab Center in Abu Dhabi. The United Arab Emirates supplies the bulk of the funding, but the State Department has contributed two full-time foreign service officers to work at the center to counter online messaging and recruitment by the Islamic State.Beyond the Sawab Center and another office to open soon in Malaysia, the administration is paying for small operations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.Mr. Lumpkin said that administration officials looked at a study done by the Quantum Group, a communications firm based in Lebanon, that found that many foreign fighters joined the Islamist State not for ideology but for a host of different reasons, from thrill-seeking to a search for redemption.Mr. Lumpkin pointed to a video posted online in April by the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremist research organization based in London, that features a Muslim family of four sitting around a dinner table set for five people. There is the usual bickering about cellphones at the table and a comment to \u201cstart eating before it gets cold.\u201d Then one son motions toward the empty place setting and the family matriarch gets angry.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s Salsan\u2019s. You know how much he loves my cooking.\u201d\u201cMom, he\u2019s not here,\u201d her son says.\u201cHe\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d the mother insists. \u201cHe never misses this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been two years.\u201dThe scene fades away as the video voice-over says, \u201cThey\u2019ll be missed more than they\u2019ll ever know.\u201dMr. Lumpkin said the video offered the kind of messaging that could be effective at convincing potential jihadists that joining the Islamist State will cost pain to their mothers.In Tirana, Albania, Blendi Salaj, a radio host, was waiting to hear back from the State Department about whether his application for $9,700 for funding for a messaging project had been approved. A report last year by the Albanian Institute of International Studies said the number of fighters from Albania who had joined the Islamic State in 2014 was between 90 and 150.Mr. Salaj said he wanted to appeal to jihadi aspirants through a series of broadcast talks in which religious leaders will discuss tolerance for other religions. He will broadcast those talks on his radio show, he said, and then will link to them on social media. \u201cWe will get to the essence of what it is like to live beside other people with tolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Profit Bump for Companies, and Tax Transparency for Investors", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byFair GameThink the world of accounting is dull? Then you don\u2019t know about the new auditing rule that is about to raise many companies\u2019 reported profits and bring greater clarity to the actual taxes big corporations pay.The new rule relates to the tax benefit that a company receives when it gives options to executives and workers. The change doesn\u2019t affect what a company must pay in taxes related to its stock option grants. It simply shifts the place where a company reports the options-related tax benefit. The shift makes the benefit more evident to investors.The standards board changed the rule as part of its accounting simplification program, intended to reduce the costs and complexities of auditing standards and maintain \u201cthe usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements,\u201d as the regulator put it.But the change will have other effects. Along with appearing to juice many companies\u2019 net earnings, it is likely to bring the spotlight back to the issue of low corporate taxes in America, possibly reigniting that debate.Bear with me while I explain the mechanics of the rule.Every year, companies generate a tax benefit when they issue nonqualified stock options, the most common type. (Nonqualified options are ones that don\u2019t qualify to be taxed at a more beneficial rate for the recipient.) The amount of the benefit to the company equals the cost of the options at the time they were dispensed multiplied by the company\u2019s effective tax rate, generally 35 percent in the United States.A company does not immediately realize this tax benefit, though. Rather, it becomes a deferred tax asset on a company\u2019s books. Only when employees exercise their options does a deduction actually occur.To compute how much a company is allowed to deduct from its taxes at that point, it must compare the exercise price of the option at the time of the grant with the stock price when the employee exercised it.When stocks are rising, as they have been recently, employees typically exercise their options at far higher levels than the prices at which the options were granted. That creates a larger tax benefit for a company than it anticipated; this excess amount is what the company deducts from its taxes.Nothing about this process has changed. What\u2019s different under the new rule is where the deduction shows up on a company\u2019s books.Under previous rules, the stock option tax benefit counted as a credit on a company\u2019s balance sheet. But with the new rule, F.A.S.B. requires that the deduction run through the income statement. This deduction will enhance net profits, especially among big option issuers like health care and technology companies.The bigger a company\u2019s option grants, of course, the larger the effects of the rule will be on its net earnings.In addition to making some companies\u2019 bottom lines look better, Mr. Willens said, the deductions associated with the new rule will bring into focus the low tax rates these companies now pay. By shifting the tax benefit to the income statement, investors will have a much clearer picture of the actual tax outlays their companies make.The fact is, few companies pay the 35 percent effective corporate tax rate in the United States. Popular tax-reducing tactics \u2014 such as keeping cash earned overseas where tax rates are lower than in the United States \u2014 bring companies\u2019 actual cash outlays for taxes far below their effective rates.Unfortunately, a company\u2019s true tax rate is not something investors can determine from reading its financial statements. But the change in stock options accounting will give investors a closer approximation of the taxes a company actually pays.Consider Facebook, a big options granter. Its most recent annual financial filing indicates that it has $1.72 billion in unrecorded excess tax benefits resulting from share-based awards it has dispensed.\u201cOnce this proposal is implemented,\u201d Mr. Willens said, the company\u2019s \u201ceffective tax rate will go down by two-thirds. Instead of being 40 percent, it will be maybe 12 or 13 percent.\u201dOf course, Facebook\u2019s true tax rate may be even lower than that \u2014 we can\u2019t tell. Still, the glimpse of what corporations actually pay in taxes, brought to light by the F.A.S.B. rule change, \u201ccould become a P.R. problem for these companies,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cSome companies are going to be unhappy that these amounts will be reflected in the income statements, because they will be subjected to more criticism.\u201dEmployee stock grants are one of the costs that companies typically remove when adjusting their earnings. So to the degree that the new rule makes a company\u2019s net profits look better, it will no longer be necessary to deduct stock options costs to achieve that end, Mr. Willens said.Overall, the F.A.S.B. rule change will present a truer picture of a company\u2019s financial position, in Mr. Willens\u2019s view. \u201cIt never made a lot of sense that the excess tax benefits bypassed the income statement and were credited to the balance sheet,\u201d he said. \u201cThese companies were not paying taxes on account of option exercises, but the financial statements made it look like they were. Companies\u2019 tax rates were overstated, and there can\u2019t be any defense for that.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Roger Ailes\u2019s Exit Is Unlikely to Erode the Fox News Citadel", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byWill Fox News\u2019s prime-time lineup remain intact? Will the network\u2019s ratings fall back to earth after this wild presidential election? Who could possibly replace Roger Ailes?No matter how unseemly his departure, Mr. Ailes will leave Fox News in strong shape. Thanks to an election year that has been a boon for all cable news channels, the network has never had higher ratings. And on Wednesday, as confusion swirled about the leadership of the network, many financial analysts told investors that the huge profits it delivers for 21st Century Fox were in no danger of suddenly disappearing.\u201cThere\u2019s a very loyal Fox audience,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. \u201cThat was part of Roger\u2019s brilliance: to identify a very large group that got badly underserved by mainstream TV news. Those people are not going anywhere.\u201dBut in the television industry \u2014 particularly in Cleveland, where many senior executives are attending the Republican National Convention \u2014 speculation about the network\u2019s future flowed freely at cocktail parties and political breakfasts.The most pressing topic was who could replace the 76-year-old Mr. Ailes.Among the initial candidates being discussed in the executive offices of 21st Century Fox, according to a person briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity, are familiar names like Bill Shine, Fox News\u2019s senior executive vice president for programming; David Rhodes, the president of CBS News and a former Fox executive; and Jesse Angelo, chief executive of The New York Post.Mr. Shine has the advantage of already being at Fox News. His appointment could calm the nerves of Fox employees, many of whom have privately complained this week about being left in the dark about what is going on at the network.Mr. Rhodes worked at Fox News for several years and has an understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the network. CBS remains in third place in both the evening news slot and in the lucrative morning hours but it has seen ratings improvements, particularly for \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d Mr. Rhodes is also friendly with James Murdoch, one of the three top executives at 21st Century Fox.Mr. Angelo, who was the best man at James Murdoch\u2019s wedding and remains a close friend, has spent his entire career working for the Murdoch empire. When Rupert Murdoch debuted a pet project of his, the short-lived iPad news project The Daily, he chose Mr. Angelo to run it. He has been the publisher of The Post for three and a half years.It is also possible that the Murdochs could choose another senior Fox News executive (Jay Wallace and Michael Clemente both run divisions) or someone from Sky News, their European flagship, which James has been closely involved in. Such a pick would offer corporate continuity and signal that the Murdochs are serious about refreshing the culture of Fox News post-Ailes.But Sky News is a far more sober outlet than its scrappier American cousin. Its anchors are restrained from offering boisterous opinions by strict European broadcasting rules. That could make for a rocky transition to the American cable news landscape, where editorializing is the norm.Ms. Kelly participated in an internal investigation into Mr. Ailes, prompted by a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the former anchor Gretchen Carlson on July 6. Ms. Kelly told investigators that Mr. Ailes made a number of advances toward her in the past, according to two people briefed on the matter.Mr. Ailes has denied the accusations by Ms. Carlson and Ms. Kelly.Whether Ms. Kelly\u2019s participation will alienate her from Fox News colleagues who are loyal to Mr. Ailes is an open question.While there is no direct parallel to Mr. Ailes in the history of television news, either in personality or current circumstances, there are examples of similar operations losing their rudders \u2014 the retirement of Roone Arledge from ABC News in 1998 or the ouster of Ted Turner from CNN in 2001. Each departure coincided with a period of difficulty for their former divisions.Mr. Turner\u2019s exit from CNN \u2014 a network he created \u2014 roughly aligned with the rise of Fox News as the top-rated cable news channel.Mr. Arledge was a beloved figure who oversaw the creation of shows like \u201c20/20\u201d and \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d and drove the ABC News evening flagship, \u201cWorld News Tonight,\u201d to longtime ratings dominance. By the time Mr. Arledge left, ABC News was beginning to show signs of wear and tear. In the years that followed, as ABC News worked to regain its footing, NBC News used the opening to pull far out in front in ratings.Fox News remains by far the highest-rated cable news network, and by a wide margin. Even so, CNN has made up some ground this year, narrowing Fox News\u2019s lead in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that is important to advertisers to its slimmest margin since the 2008 election year. (Ratings tend to go up during election cycles.)But even if CNN is having a strong year, a Fox News without Mr. Ailes is still formidable.Financial analysts were skeptical that any change would affect Fox News\u2019s bottom line, especially because the lucrative affiliate fees that Fox News earns are locked in for years.If there is one area of concern, it is the network\u2019s aging audience. According to Nielsen, the median age of a Fox News viewer is 67, the oldest of the cable news channels. (MSNBC\u2019s is 63, and CNN\u2019s is 61.)\u201cSustaining this level of intensity after November is going to be a challenge,\u201d Mr. Heyward, the former CBS president, said. \u201cThe biggest challenge is one that Roger himself hadn\u2019t really confronted: the transition to digital platforms.\u201dAnd whoever succeeds Mr. Ailes will have two missions: bringing a restless staff back together and figuring out a future for the network.As Charles L. Ponce de Leon, the author of the 2015 book \u201cThat\u2019s the Way It Is: A History of Television News in America,\u201d put it: \u201cA broader course correction is necessary at Fox News \u2014 they must attract younger viewers \u2014 and that kind of effort will be extremely difficult because its loyal viewers have such rigid expectations.\u201dBrooks Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Verizon Announces $4.8 Billion Deal for Yahoo\u2019s Internet Business", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byThe fate of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who came under sharp shareholder criticism for failing to arrest the company\u2019s long downward spiral during her four-year tenure, is unclear.In an interview, Ms. Mayer said, \u201cI plan to stay. I love Yahoo and I want to see it into its next chapter.\u201d But she and Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, said it had not yet been decided if she would have a role at the company after the deal closed in early 2017.If she is terminated, she will be due severance of about $57 million. If she received that payout, her total compensation from Yahoo for her service so far would be about $218 million, according to the compensation research firm Equilar.Verizon, which has a vast amount of information about its customers\u2019 internet use, hopes the combination will help it create a strong No. 3 challenger to Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Mr. Armstrong said the acquisition strengthens Verizon\u2019s offerings to advertisers and consumers and gives it much more scale, since Yahoo claims one billion users who visit at least once a month.\u201cThis deal is a leap forward from serving millions of customers to billions,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said in an interview. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands on the planet.\u201dVerizon plans to keep most of Yahoo\u2019s current products, including its still popular email service, and invest in them to make them stronger. \u201cOur strategy is to structure ourselves as a house of brands,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. However, he said that Verizon has not yet decided what it wants to do in search, an area where Yahoo has waged a losing fight against Google for a decade.The Yahoo purchase carries risks for Verizon, which is well known for its wireless phone and internet services but has little experience in the cutthroat business of digital content. Analysts say that its purchase of AOL has yet to prove its value, although Mr. Armstrong is a well regarded operator.Ms. Mayer said Verizon would help Yahoo get better distribution for its mobile apps in areas like search, mail, news, weather and sports. Verizon, she said, could promote Yahoo services on its smartphones and in its retail stores.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cWe set out to transform this company \u2014 and we\u2019ve made incredible progress. We counteracted many of the tectonic shifts of declining legacy businesses, and built a Yahoo that is unequivocally stronger, nimbler and more modern,\u201d she wrote.Verizon agreed to pay an extra $1.1 billion on top of the purchase price to cash out Yahoo employees\u2019 restricted stock upon the close of the deal, Yahoo said. Many employees, particularly the senior executives, are also entitled to large severance packages if they are fired by Verizon.\u201cIt does mark the end of a particular time period for the company,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cThat said, there are great opportunities for Yahoo, for the brand, for the services, with Verizon.\u201dAfter the close of the deal, Yahoo shareholders will still own shares in what is left of the company, essentially an investment fund with two holdings: a 15 percent stake, worth about $32 billion based on its recent share price, in the Chinese internet company Alibaba; and a 35.5 percent stake, worth about $8.7 billion, in Yahoo Japan.The sale, which still must be approved by Yahoo shareholders and regulators, also does not include Yahoo\u2019s cash and its noncore patents, which it is trying to sell separately.\u201cFor investors, this came to the expected conclusion: Verizon was the front-runner very early on,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cThe real question for investors now is what\u2019s next?

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Charges in Europe Need Quick Action", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe European Commission has hit Google with a third antitrust charge. This time it says the tech company abused its search dominance on third-party websites. It also reinforced a claim, first made in 2010, that Google favored its own shopping service.A speedier, more focused campaign would better serve justice.The newest charge hits closest to the heart of Google\u2019s empire. The company makes about 90 percent of its revenue from advertising. The commission claims Google acted anti-competitively by forcing onerous contracts on companies that used its search service on their sites. For example, a newspaper would use the service to let readers search its archive, or a retailer would allow shoppers to look for merchandise. These partners were obliged to prominently place a minimum number of ads served by Google and were forbidden to use rival search companies to place ads.Google\u2019s 80 percent share of this market gives it plenty of power to act abusively. These contracts, as well as provisions requiring third parties to receive Google\u2019s approval before making any change to the display of competing search ads, skirted the line and may have overstepped it.The commission is confronting Google on other fronts. It accuses the company of forcing handset manufacturers using its Android operating system to install Google apps and bundle services and apps together. That\u2019s a potentially strong case, as similar behavior landed Microsoft in trouble.Then there\u2019s the charge that Google favors its own comparison shopping services. The commission has now added more evidence to its underwhelming claims. There is little evidence consumers were harmed, and it is a minor service for the search giant. Yet regulators have pursued this charge since 2010. The newest charges add yet more time to the clock, giving Google another eight weeks to reply.That is a long time, considering the speed with which the tech market shifts. Facebook has tripled its active users and multiplied its revenue ninefold during the commission\u2019s inquiry into Google\u2019s shopping service. Regulators need to be thorough, but they also must hit companies fast and hard with strong charges aimed at the heart of abusive business practices. The commission\u2019s slow and scattered approach is an ineffective way to curb tech monopolies.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

He is already on high alert.He slowly eases his vehicle out into the alley of a precinct in Seattle (population: 684,451), scanning left and right as the precinct\u2019s metal garage door trundles down behind him.The brick alley has recessed alcoves that could conceal someone lying in wait, and the new safety protocol in his department says to take no chances, make no assumptions and avoid being predictable.\u201cOne of the most vulnerable times in our day is shift change,\u201d Officer Virgilio, 31, says as he checks the route. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of avoiding certain patterns. Anybody who is trying to organize some sort of attack on police officers is going to do some sort of surveillance. They\u2019re going to figure out when our shift changes are, they are going to figure out what doors we use to get in and out of the precinct. And it doesn\u2019t take long to gather that type of intelligence.\u201d_________Lt. Scott Finn begins all his shifts in Prince George\u2019s County, Md. (population: 909,535), a densely packed suburb just outside Washington, D.C., by passing through a set of doors scarred by two bullet holes, each a round shock of silver, embedded in mundane tan paint.\u201cIt was just the fog of war,\u201d Lieutenant Finn says. \u201cEverything had to align perfectly to have something like that happen.\u201dThe lieutenant pushes through the doors and walks to his unmarked patrol car, where he slips on his bulletproof vest, pressing the Velcro on its sides to make sure it is tightly secured.Another shift begins.The call came about an hour in: Shots fired. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go in kind of cautious,\u201d Officer Michael Walker of the Milwaukee Police Department says.He\u2019s 39 and 6-foot-2, an imposing 10-year veteran of the force on patrol with an affable rookie named Nathan Smalkoski.They speed through the North Side of Milwaukee (population: 600,155), parts of which have long wrestled with poverty, disinvestment and violence. It\u2019s over 90 degrees outside and it\u2019s busy.The shift will send them to answer a call about the theft of a Lexus. A car wreck. Domestic dispute. School burglary alarm. One assignment after the next, without any breaks, not even for lunch, which amounted to a Brisk Lemonade from a 7-Eleven store.\u201cI\u2019m going to have a heightened awareness of what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Officer Walker says on his way to the shots-fired call. He parks a little farther away from some incidents now, to gauge the circumstances more carefully.Six fresh bullet casings are scattered through an alley. A man on a bike says some people sped off in an old Honda.But the report of shots fired came not from a neighbor here, but from ShotSpotter technology, which captures the sounds of gunfire to determine where a shooting is taking place. A worker at a nearby school and many of the neighbors heard the shots but apparently did not call 911. Gunshots happen all the time, some said.\u201cPolice! Anybody home?\u201d Officer Walker calls out, loudly knocking on one door.\u201cHello ma\u2019am, how are you?\u201d he says to a woman who answers.\u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d she says.Officer Walker explains to the elderly couple who live there that their house was hit with a bullet. He climbs to a packed storage room on their second floor and digs under old blankets, lamps, computers and mattresses to find the hole where the bullet came through their wall.Outside, behind yellow police tape, Officer Smalkoski is marking the shell casings. A resident walks up and begins videotaping the officer with his phone. \u201cEverybody records everything,\u201d Officer Smalkoski says.In Paulding County, Ga. (population 152,238), west of Atlanta, a family brought a sign to the sheriff\u2019s headquarters that now hangs in the squad room: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called Children of God.\u201dIn the Connecticut countryside, children from a local camp have drawn pictures, sent cards and delivered a large poster to the police station, thanking officers for their service.In many places, officers have been showered with gifts of food, Starbucks, cold drinks.\u201cOver the past five days, I\u2019ve had more people offer to buy me a coffee than I can remember,\u201d says Sgt. Thomas Glynn, 46, during a patrol through Cambridge, Mass. (population 106,844).Near Harvard Square, Sergeant Glynn pulls up to a bus at a parking meter that has expired. Another officer had given the driver a ticket and told him to move the bus, but while backing up, the bus driver hit the officer\u2019s motorcycle.The driver, whose first language was not English, grew agitated and shouted, \u201cAnd you wonder why police officers kill people!\u201dSergeant Glynn says: \u201cThat was not what he meant to say. What he meant to say was, \u2018And you wonder why people kill police officers!\u2019\u201dDallas and Baton Rouge had made their way to the land of Harvard. The man\u2019s outburst, Sergeant Glynn says, \u201chad everything to do with what\u2019s happening now.\u201d_________Lieutenant Finn points to his patrol car\u2019s door. \u201cLike the dent?\u201d he asks.Just days earlier, he says, someone had kicked his car and yelled, \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d before taking off on a motorcycle.It was, he says, part of a pattern of increased tension that he has noticed in Prince George\u2019s County ever since police officers shot and killed Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn., on back-to-back days this month.Lieutenant Finn says he sees more pushback and hears more obscenities from residents now than ever before.\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that until just recently,\u201d he says, while driving through a stretch of the county studded with strip malls, just outside Washington. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m fortunate that it was a kick, and not a bullet. We can see that that\u2019s a strong possibility.\u201d_________A dark night. A country road in Coventry, Conn. (population: 12,438). A Dodge Durango races by, going around 20 miles per hour over the speed limit. Sgt. Michael Hicks pulls out behind, following up and down a hill until he reaches a straightaway. The flashing lights go on, the Durango pulls over.A young man with a shaved head sits in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cI definitely notice that now more people I pull over, if they\u2019re black, they right away turn on the lights and put their hands on the wheel,\u201d Sergeant Hicks says. \u201cI like that. It makes me feel safe.\u201dHe flips on his body camera, gets out of his police S.U.V. and goes through his routine. He puts two fingers on the black Durango\u2019s trunk, to make sure no one is inside \u2014 two cops were once killed when someone jumped out of a trunk, he explains. He flashes his light into the back seat, then the front, and approaches the driver with his holstered gun on a hip that he positions away from the car window.\u201cWe\u2019re trained for Armageddon,\u201d Sergeant Hicks says back in the vehicle. \u201cWe\u2019re trained for the worst.\u201dHe returns to the driver, a Hispanic man with no previous traffic violations, and gives him a warning: \u201cSlow down. You hit a deer going 63, and it won\u2019t be good.\u201d_________The gangs of Compton, Calif. (population 97,877) \u2014 the Crips and the Pirus, the Compton Varrio Tortilla Flats and others \u2014 hang out in places that are easy to defend: alleys, dead ends and a housing development with \u201cone way in, one way out,\u201d where residents shout warnings to one another as soon as the police arrive.\u201cGangsters like cul-de-sacs,\u201d says Deputy Sheriff Mizrain Orrego, 30, driving with his partner through Compton, the section of Los Angeles County (population: 10,170,292) made famous by violence and gangster rap. \u201cThey can jump the fence onto the street behind, and we can\u2019t follow in the car. Or they see us coming and toss the pistol over the fence. You ask for help, and everyone walks away and says nothing happened.\u201dDeputy Orrego and his partner check one cul-de-sac after another. In most spots, men are hanging around outside, often drinking beer, but the officers have no cause to search them. They ask how they\u2019re doing \u2014 \u201dYou good?\u201d \u2014 and then move on.But as soon as the police cruiser turns one corner, a young man at the end of the block takes off running. He ducks into the shadows behind an abandoned house, and he\u2019s gone.Deputy Samuel Aldama, 29, hits the gas. The cruiser flies to the end of the dead-end street, and in an instant both he and Deputy Orrego are out of their car, yelling at a group of young black men to put their hands in the air. Each deputy keeps a finger on his weapon, but the guns stay in their holsters.The abandoned house has become a hangout for the South Side Compton Crips, and Deputy Orrego is convinced that there is a gun here \u2014 or, at least, that there was one.\u201cEvery time you get three of these guys together, you know they have a gun somewhere,\u201d Deputy Orrego says.Finding a gun is the primary challenge in the cat-and-mouse game that the officers have been playing all day, as part of a summer unit aimed at limiting gang activity. Their shift started at 9 a.m. It\u2019s 11 p.m.The deputies have pulled 18 guns off the streets in the last nine weeks. But none this day.The victim \u2014 a black man, perhaps in his 30s \u2014 lies uncovered on the sidewalk of the bus station\u2019s bay, his backpack askew on the pavement. His arm is curled toward his body, frozen a few inches off the ground.A handful of officers manage the scene. Lieutenant Finn heads for dinner.\u201c \u2018Black Lives Matter When the Police Kill Them,\u2019 \u201d Lieutenant Finn says, as if arguing with protesters. \u201cHave that be your name.\u201d_________Sometimes \u2014 especially since the recent shootings by police \u2014 black residents will say they were pulled over because of racial profiling, Deputy Orrego says.\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he says, driving through Compton and past low-slung homes tagged with graffiti by competing gangs. \u201cWe\u2019re minorities as well.\u201dThe news media don\u2019t tell the whole story, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what goes on.\u201d\u201cWe all have families to go home to,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than you think.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that in Compton, in the west side, the reality is you will stop and contact more African-Americans,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the east side, you\u2019ll contact more Hispanics.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that people who steal cars are mostly Hispanics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reason why is because more Hispanics who are involved in any criminal activity, they use methamphetamine. So now they need to support their habit. Where African-Americans, they don\u2019t do that for the most part. They don\u2019t consume methamphetamine.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that African-Americans, at least in the city of Compton \u2014 and I\u2019m talking from our training and experience \u2014 they commit more violent crimes, more shootings. There\u2019s more gang feuds among black-on-black.\u201dThe cruiser rolls slowly around a corner, his words on crime and race still hanging in the air._________Deputy Constable Steve W. Faulkner, 39, joins two other deputies at a taco truck and food trailer parked side by side in a strip-mall parking lot in Precinct 1 in Houston (population: 2,296,224). They are talking about guns, life, the job.A few days ago, he says, after the attack in Dallas, he and other deputies responded to a call from a woman who had concerns about social-media messages her teenage daughter had been receiving.The woman and her daughter were black. The deputies were white. The woman and her daughter were not pleased with the deputies after they suggested removing an app from her daughter\u2019s phone as a possible solution.\u201cThe younger girl, she\u2019s probably about 13, she just piped up and said, \u2018You don\u2019t like black people. If this would have been a white girl, this would have been handled totally different,\u2019\u201d Deputy Faulkner recalls.\u201cThat,\u201d he says, \u201cis a direct result of everything going on right now.\u201dLater in the shift, the dispatcher\u2019s voice fills the car: A group of men are waving a gun in front of a Washateria laundry. One is a Hispanic male in a black shirt and red pants, the other a black male in a white shirt and white shorts.Deputy Faulkner speeds toward the scene, lights on and siren wailing.As he turns into the Washateria parking lot, he sees a black man and three Hispanic men standing next to their cars. He gets out of his car. He is alone.One of the Hispanic men wears a dark gray shirt and red shorts. The deputy pulls his gun and orders all four onto the ground. The men are not happy, though they do as they are told. He handcuffs two of them. He searches them and finds nothing. He uncuffs the two men.He explains why he is there, and the tensions ease up. \u201cThanks for not shooting me,\u201d one of the men says, smiling as he holds his hands in the air.Deputy Faulkner slides back into the driver\u2019s seat and turns to the four men. \u201cY\u2019all have a good one,\u201d he says._________Officers John Buchanan and Robert Bramble are cruising through Bedford-Stuyvesant, one of Brooklyn\u2019s rapidly changing neighborhoods.Officer Buchanan, 24, is white. He grew up in suburban Suffolk County, on Long Island, where he still lives. He has two cousins who are police officers.Officer Bramble, 24, is black. He grew up in Brooklyn, in East Flatbush. He still lives in the city, about 15 minutes from the stationhouse. His father was a New York City police officer.It is hot, and as they drive along the streets of the 79th Precinct they notice a now-familiar sight: \u201cIt\u2019s S.O.S.,\u201d Officer Bramble says.On the sidewalk, a small contingent from the group Save Our Streets is protesting \u2014 a woman with a bullhorn condemning violence and other people wearing T-shirts that say: \u201cStop shooting. Start living.\u201dOfficer Bramble says the protests are now a part of life in Brooklyn (population: 2,636,735). \u201cThere are people in the law enforcement world that are hurt right now; there\u2019s civilians out there reading and seeing these things, and experiencing them, that hurt right now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt affects everybody.\u201dEven with the tensions surrounding policing, Officer Bramble does not feel defensive.\u201cI don\u2019t personally feel any animosity because I feel like I understand where the protesters I have encountered are coming from and what they\u2019re trying to achieve and establish,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be protesters out there who have a more sinister agenda. I just, in my limited experience, have not encountered them yet.\u201dOfficer Buchanan shifts the discussion to the importance of neighborhood policing.\u201cWe can use that to try and change some people\u2019s perspectives, or at least be an example for what policing in a community should be,\u201d he says. Still, he thinks anyone who is not an officer cannot understand the pressures and risks of the job.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a perspective on this job, in my opinion, unless you do it,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless you\u2019re in policing, doing it every day as a career, you can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d_________Cpl. Jon Mannino in Park Forest remembers another example of how things have changed. Shortly after the fatal shooting of Mr. Castile by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop, an African-American driver that Corporal Mannino had pulled over seemed afraid.\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m reaching for my wallet, don\u2019t shoot me,\u2019\u201d Corporal Mannino says. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t being funny. He wasn\u2019t being sarcastic.\u201d\u201cWhat can you say?\u201d the corporal says. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not personally upsetting, it\u2019s upsetting that that\u2019s where we are right now as a country.\u201dDeputy Faulkner\u2019s cellphone rings as he sits in his patrol vehicle outside the precinct office. It\u2019s a fellow Houston deputy. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fixin\u2019 to roll out,\u201d he tells the caller.He is silent as he holds the phone to his ear, then quickly steps out of the vehicle and heads into the precinct. The deputy was calling to relay a concern. The wife of a lieutenant has been having trouble reaching her husband on his cellphone. She is worried.Deputy Faulkner returns to the vehicle. He reports back: The lieutenant is in the precinct office. He\u2019s fine. He just left his cellphone inside while talking to a colleague outside. It took only those few minutes for the lieutenant\u2019s wife to start panicking.Deputy Faulkner says this is how the job is lately. His own wife calls more often to check on him. He and his 10-year-old daughter have a ritual before he leaves the house: She stands at the front door and gives him a kiss on the forehead. Lately, though, she has started telling him, \u201cBe safe\u201d and \u201cBe careful,\u201d phrases she had not used before the Dallas ambush.\u201cIt changes the way you do patrolling,\u201d Deputy Faulkner says. \u201cYour head\u2019s on a swivel now.\u201dA front-page article on Sunday about police patrols during a time of racial tension in the wake of police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La., included comments from an officer in Prince George\u2019s County, Md., about race relations, including his criticism of the Black Lives Matter group. The officer, Lt. Scott Finn, made the comments while being accompanied on patrol by a New York Times reporter, who was paired with Lieutenant Finn by the Prince George\u2019s Police Department. But the article should have included pertinent background information about Lieutenant Finn. He was investigated several times by the department after being accused of using excessive force, and was flagged by the department for aggressive behavior, The Washington Post reported as part of a series of articles in 2001 about the department\u2019s failure to discipline police officers accused of abuse. Lieutenant Finn, who went by the name Edward S. Finn, was cleared of all charges.Advertisement"}

But now that they see Brexit and the massive trouble caused by the E.U.\u2019s common currency, the bloom is off the rose.So the Turkish military finally had space to act against Erdogan, and act they have done.We were going to depose a tyrant and make everybody\u2019s life better. We were going to put a stop to brutality.What we should have learned is that some problems don\u2019t have quick answers that don\u2019t create worse problems. So jumping on the Trump wagon, or telling Hillary and Obama to do something, anything, ignores the gravity of a situation that won\u2019t get better tomorrow no matter how loudly we yell or how many people we detain or bombs we deploy.We are a world awash in weapons and grievances.Take them on directly if you want real change. But be prepared for it to take time.This comment had more than 300 reader recommendations. Otherwise, we cede control of our lives to men like the driver of the death truck.And yet \u2014 what do I say to them? I don\u2019t want my children to live in fear and think the world is a scary, horrible place \u2014 but I am secretly terrified for their well being.This comment received more than 240 reader recommendations.This comment received more than 2,300 likes.What Trump doesn\u2019t realize is that he will lose many votes for picking Pence. There may be many happy Indiana citizens tomorrow!It also has me wishing the American conservative movement could also avoid the divisiveness of so-called family values and other social issues which have torn this country apart for years.Years ago, Ms. May campaigned against police profiling, a stance viewed as heretical to the now-purified American conservative movement.A refreshingly thoughtful, balanced individual. Good luck to the Brits.Nevertheless, there seemed to be a lot to like about Theresa May. Very hard-working, refuses to yuck it up with the boys, has plenty of steel in her character, and \u2014 unlike Margaret Thatcher \u2014 has made real efforts to help other women succeed in politics.Then she blew it for me on her first day by appointing the discredited and demonstrably untrustworthy clown Boris Johnson as foreign secretary.That\u2019s the rough equivalent of America\u2019s secretary of state. Appoint him court jester or tea maker, but come on \u2014 foreign secretary?So much for any hope she\u2019d be a serious, pragmatic P.M. Very disappointing.Why is everyone more concerned about a man that is not even in power than people in positions of power that continue to overstep and abuse that power at a seemingly increasing rate?We just saw [Attorney General Loretta] Lynch and Bill Clinton meet at the Phoenix airport to comment on an ongoing investigation of which the latter\u2019s wife was the main subject; now we have an \u201capolitical\u201d Supreme Court justice making strong political comments outside of the courtroom.This is a democratic republic, not an aristocracy.I absolutely loathe walking as exercise, and it\u2019s only bearable if I\u2019m doing something else at the same time or if I\u2019m walking my dog because he needs it. Pok\u00e9mon Go makes my walks less dull, and gets me moving more places than my usual rut.If my dog and I go out for a few hours of walking and playing Pok\u00e9mon Go, everyone wins: He gets exercise, I get exercise, and we both have fun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1 Billion for Dollar Shave Club: Why Every Company Should Worry", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe deal anecdotally shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change. The very nature of a company is fundamentally changing, becoming smaller and leaner with far fewer employees.Dollar Shave Club was a phenom in the men\u2019s grooming industry. The online business was founded in 2011 by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin to combat the high cost of razors. The idea was rather simple. Instead of paying $10 or $20 a month at a store for disposable razors, a Dollar Shave Club subscriber could go online and set up a regular order to be shipped to his home monthly at a fraction of the retail cost.From there, the start-up investor community came in and Dollar Shave Club soared, raising $160 million in venture capital. It captured about 8 percent of the market in only a few years. It also expanded into other personal care products like \u201cOne Wipe Charlie,\u201d a wet wipe to replace toilet paper.The company\u2019s rise was captured by the Unilever purchase announced last week.The wealth will be spread among a few. Dollar Shave Club has over three million subscribers but only about 190 employees. Its razors were made in South Korea by Dorco. Distribution was initially handled in-house but eventually was contracted to a third-party company in Kentucky. What remained was a terrific design, marketing and customer service shop; and a business that was easily expandable to meet demand and that had a good niche with men who do not like to shop. These super-successful companies with few employees should worry an America struggling with inequality.Now it is possible to leverage technology and transportation systems that never existed before. Dollar Shave Club used Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing service started by the online retailing giant in 2006 that encouraged a proliferation of e-commerce companies. Manufacturing now is just as much a line item as is a distribution apparatus. This is the business strategy of many other disruptive companies, including the home-sharing site Airbnb, which upends the idea of needing a hotel. The ride-hailing start-up Uber could never have been possible without a number of inventions including the internet, the smartphone and, most important, location tracking technology, enabling anyone to be a driver.It means that the riches will be split among the select few who have the education and skills to be at the heart of the new decentralized company. The Korean razor company that manufactures Dollar Shave\u2019s razors will not be sharing the $1 billion deal price with its employees. It was not even an investor (the investors here will also profit, with returns of up to 20 times their investments).This is a scary time for a company. But the state of play creates the potential for mass and creative disruption. Again, in the past, challenging Gillette would have been impossible. It would have required billions of dollars to invest in a distribution network and advertising to get the product on store shelves.No more. Now you can get free advertising through YouTube, easy distribution through the mail system and low-cost sales through the internet. Factories and distribution can be bolted on throughout the globe.This means all companies should be fearful, but not all is lost. In this world, intellectual property and unique assets \u2014 like Facebook\u2019s more than one billion users \u2014 become paramount. Unique technology means you have a right that cannot be taken away or commoditized. Gillette sued Dollar Shave Club for patent infringement, but it is hard to patent a simple razor.Dollar Shave Club may be an uncommon event. But it is no doubt the wave of the future. Expect more start-ups in disruptive areas. Expect more old-line companies to find themselves on their back feet, compensating by paying outsize, sometimes incredulous sums for breakthrough competitors. And expect more enormous investment in all things new as the old companies without unique assets struggle to compete.An article on the DealBook page on Wednesday about the high prices old-line consumer products companies are paying for disruptive start-ups misspelled the name of a technology website that reported on market share gains by small brands. It is TechCrunch, not TechCruch.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

{"Headline": "Qandeel Baloch, Pakistani Social Media Celebrity, Dead in Apparent Honor Killing", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byThe police said Ms. Baloch was apparently attacked on Friday night while she was asleep in her parents\u2019 house in Muzaffarabad, a town on the outskirts of Multan in the province of Punjab. Ms. Baloch\u2019s brother, Waseem Ahmed Azeem, was arrested late Saturday night in connection with her death.Ms. Baloch, 26, a model, singer and social media celebrity, had gained notoriety in Pakistan recently because of provocative, seminude photographs of herself that she posted on social media sites, and appearances in music videos.Her bold persona defied the conventions of Pakistan, a deeply conservative society. She was reviled by some in the country for being crass and vulgar, and prone to attention-seeking stunts. But other Pakistanis admired her defiance and independence. She attracted more than 700,000 followers on Facebook and at least 40,000 on Twitter.\u201cQandeel was probably the first true female internet celebrity in Pakistan, in that her celebrity had nothing to do with any achievement beyond her provocative presence on social media,\u201d said Hasan Zaidi, a Pakistani filmmaker and media critic.\u201cIt was unfathomable to a lot of Pakistanis that a real woman could be as brazen or shameless about her sexuality publicly, because her entire persona was built around flaunting her body, talking about sex and being in everyone\u2019s face,\u201d Mr. Zaidi said.Born to a poor family from the backwaters of Punjab, Ms. Baloch, whose real name was Fauzia Azeem, said she had run away from home to pursue her dream of becoming a star.

The pictures show Ms. Baloch pouting and wearing the cleric\u2019s hat while he, seemingly bedazzled, stares into the camera.Many Pakistanis saw the photographs as scandalous, and Mr. Qavi was removed from his position on the country\u2019s moon-sighting committee, which determines when Ramadan starts and ends in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar.On Wednesday, she found herself in the spotlight again after local media outlets reported that a man identified as her former husband claimed that he had a son with her and that he had divorced her after he could not meet her demands to provide a house and a luxury car. In response, Ms. Baloch said she had been a victim of domestic abuse.Ms. Baloch was not shy about saying she wanted to be famous.The news of her death prompted an immediate outcry on Twitter and Facebook in Pakistan, with many people condemning her killing and praising Ms. Baloch for her irreverent and uninhibited ways.\u201cQandeel Baloch was no role model,\u201d Sherry Rehman, an opposition politician and a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, posted on Twitter. \u201cBut she deserved a better life and death. Strongly condemn.\u201dThe killing has put the spotlight back on so-called honor killings in Pakistan. Each year, hundreds of Pakistani women are killed by relatives angered by behavior they believe has tarnished the family\u2019s reputation, human-rights activists say.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has vowed to strengthen laws intended to prevent such killings, but critics say no concrete steps have been taken yet.In most cases, the honor killings take place within the family, said Syeda Sughra Imam, a former senator from Punjab who has pushed for legislation against the practice.\u201cThe accused and the complainant are from the same family and they forgive each other,\u201d Ms Imam said. \u201cNo one is ever prosecuted.\u201dMs. Imam\u2019s proposed legislation calls for eliminating a \u201cforgiveness clause\u201d in Pakistani law that allows families to reach a financial settlement or to forgive the killer.\u201cThis killing with impunity has to stop,\u201d Ms. Imam said.Asim Tanveer contributed reporting from Multan, Pakistan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Delicate Balance on Issue of Race and Policing", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byWARSAW \u2014 As Air Force One headed for Europe on Thursday afternoon, President Obama holed up in the plane\u2019s office editing a Facebook post meant to express his anguish at two deadly shootings by police officers. Given what had happened, he told his aides, he didn\u2019t think it was enough.Wrestling with what the appropriate thing to do instead was the start of a wrenching 10 hours in which Mr. Obama would find himself whipsawed by grim events back home, forcing him to once again search for the right tone in a moment of national shock and mourning.In that time, Mr. Obama delivered a trans-Atlantic call for racial justice after the gruesome deaths of two black men at the hands of the police, only to face the same television cameras hours later to denounce the killings of five officers by a black sniper.For Mr. Obama, the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., and Philando Castile in suburban St. Paul and the bloody reprisal in Dallas encapsulated the challenge he has faced throughout his presidency: how to confront a justice system that he views as tilted against the very people whom he, as the nation\u2019s first black president, seemed singularly equipped to help.As someone who knows well the persuasive power of speech, Mr. Obama has sought to use the authority of his office to amplify and support the emerging Black Lives Matter movement while striving not to become an unwitting megaphone for anti-police sentiment that has at times fueled violent protests and police shootings.\u201cThis president\u2019s role, and his unique quality, is to try to be reassuring and empathetic,\u201d said Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League. \u201cTo try to be healing, but also to try to understand the pain both of the families of the victims in Baton Rouge and Minnesota and the pain in Dallas.\u201dMr. Obama had left for a five-day trip to consult with European and NATO leaders hours after the bloody aftermath of the second police shooting in two days was streamed live on Facebook. Four hours into the flight to his first stop, Warsaw, the president stopped his press secretary, Josh Earnest, in a plane corridor.He had decided to make a statement himself as soon as they landed, and had told his aides to collect statistics demonstrating racial bias in the criminal justice system. The carefully balanced statement he gave condemned those biases but acknowledged the dangers faced by the police.While the president grabbed a few hours of sleep, the second half of his argument came terrifyingly true, when a sniper opened fire on police officers on the streets of Dallas. At his direction, his aides scrambled to prepare new remarks, discussing the logistics in emails that officials back at the White House started receiving at 2:30 a.m. Washington time.This time, Mr. Obama abandoned the calibrated language of the previous night, condemning the Dallas shootings as a \u201cvicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.\u201d As he spoke Friday morning, advisers began discussing whether to cut short his trip to Europe and how he might honor the victims in all three cities when he returned.Early Saturday, after Mr. Obama had returned from dinner with other NATO leaders, the White House announced that he would shorten his trip by a day. He will fly to Spain on Saturday evening for a meeting with King Felipe VI and a speech to troops at an American naval station, but will skip a sightseeing visit to Seville. Early next week, Mr. Obama will travel to Dallas.\u201cIn his gut, what he feels is this isn\u2019t a matter of choosing between standing up for the rights of people and standing up for the police who do their jobs and are desperately needed,\u201d said David Axelrod, a longtime friend and former White House adviser. \u201cHe understands that the real solution to these problems requires transcending that kind of thinking.\u201dFinding a way to transcend the country\u2019s divisions has proved difficult. Grieving families in Minnesota and Louisiana made searing demands for justice that Mr. Obama cannot easily deliver, and some police advocates blamed him for what they said contributed to an environment that encouraged attacks on the police.Speaking in Warsaw early Friday, Mr. Obama pleaded with Americans to imagine an officer shooting and killing a member of their family. \u201cHow would you feel?\u201d he asked. Ten hours later, after learning of the dead officers in Dallas, Mr. Obama said, \u201cToday is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices that they make for us.\u201dIf Mr. Obama\u2019s words seemed familiar, it is because he has used them so many times in the past, after African-Americans have been the victims of violence by law enforcement authorities. The balance he has tried to strike between the grievances of the victims and the legitimate concerns of the authorities goes back to the earliest days of his presidency.He has presided over a country too often gripped by grief and anger about the killing of young, black men at the hands of the police. After a grand jury in 2014 declined to indict officers in the killing of Eric Garner in New York City, Mr. Obama declared it \u201can American problem.\u201d\u201cWhen anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my job as president to help solve it.\u201dBut Mr. Obama has also labored to provide moral support to officers, many of whom say they feel under siege, their actions scrutinized by a distrustful public. Speaking to a police chief\u2019s association in Chicago last year, he hailed the story of an immigrant officer in New York who was shot as he pursued a suspect.\u201cOfficer Holder didn\u2019t run toward danger because he thought of himself as a hero, he ran toward danger because he was a cop,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI want to be as clear as I can be. I reject any narrative that seeks to divide police and communities that they serve.\u201dMr. Obama had barely moved into the White House when he tripped over the issue of race and policing, calling out a white police officer for \u201cacting stupidly\u201d when he arrested a black Harvard professor. The ensuing furor did not recede until Mr. Obama hosted a White House \u201cbeer summit.\u201dBut the passage of time failed to make it easier to find the right balance. Some African-American critics assailed his delay in speaking out after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida, at the hands of a resident, calling it an abdication of Mr. Obama\u2019s responsibility as a president and a black man.Other critics slammed the president for waiting almost a full day to issue a statement on the execution-style slaying of two New York City officers as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn.William Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, on Fox on Thursday accused Mr. Obama\u2019s administration of appeasing violent criminals in ways that \u201cled directly to the climate that has made Dallas possible.\u201dWhite House officials vehemently reject such criticism, citing the president\u2019s repeated condemnations of violence against the police as an answer to racial injustice. In his second set of remarks on Friday in Poland, Mr. Obama once again repeated it.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement.\u201dMark Landler reported from Warsaw, and Michael D. Shear from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Times Co. Reports a Loss, and a Fall in Digital Ad Revenue", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byThe company had strong growth in digital subscriptions, it said on Thursday, but digital advertising revenue, which has been a bright spot in the past, declined.During an earnings call with investors, Mark Thompson, the company\u2019s chief executive, struck an optimistic tone. \u201cIt was an excellent quarter for audience growth, engagement and our digital subscription business,\u201d he said, adding that The Times drew 126 million unique users in June, and that engagement for nonsubscribers increased 20 percent year-over-year.In the next quarter, The Times expects to add 55,000 to 60,000 net digital-only subscriptions for its news products and roughly 15,000 net subscriptions to its crossword product.The company reported a slight net loss of about $500,000 for the quarter, compared with net income of $16 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company took a charge of roughly $12 million, largely in severance costs related to the Paris closings.Total revenue fell 3 percent, to $373 million from $383 million, in the same quarter a year earlier, as The Times continued to struggle with declining advertising revenue. Total advertising revenue fell about 12 percent, to $131 million. Print advertising revenue slid 14 percent in the quarter, and digital advertising revenue dropped 7 percent, to $45 million. Digital advertising revenue now accounts for more than a third of the company\u2019s total ad revenue.\u201cDigital advertising was somewhat lower than we expected for the quarter,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. Increases in mobile, branded content and programmatic advertising, he added, were \u201cnot enough to offset declines in web home page and other traditional display advertising.\u201d The company expects total advertising revenue to continue to decrease in the mid-single digits next quarter, though it anticipates double-digit growth in digital advertising.Circulation revenue increased about 3 percent, to $219 million, as growth from the company\u2019s digital subscription revenue and an increase in home-delivery prices offset a decline in print copies sold. Total daily print circulation declined 6 percent in the quarter, and Sunday circulation fell 4 percent. Circulation revenue from digital-only subscriptions increased 15 percent, to $56 million.Adjusted operating profit, the company\u2019s preferred method of assessing performance, decreased to $55 million in the quarter, from $64 million in the year-ago period.Like many newspapers faced with declining print circulation and falling advertising revenue, The Times has looked for new revenue opportunities. It has focused on virtual reality, video and branded content, for example, and pushed aggressively into Facebook Live. The company produced more than 400 Facebook Live videos in the quarter, Mr. Thompson said.In February, The Times announced a sweeping strategy review of the newsroom that will include reshaping the newsroom for the digital age and identifying areas for cost-cutting. The company also aims to double its total digital revenue to $800 million by 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a good, hard strategic look at costs,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cYou can expect to hear more about that on future earnings calls.\u201dCharges related to the company\u2019s recent buyout offerings were not reflected in this quarter\u2019s earnings. About 80 Times employees took buyouts. The Times expects to take a severance charge next quarter of about $11 million resulting from the buyouts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Garth Brooks Is Returning to New York to \u2018Shake Things Up\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byBut that concert in Central Park on Aug. 7, 1997, proved an unqualified triumph, and a landmark moment in country music history: It\u2019s still the largest show ever held at the site, with an estimated attendance of almost a million. The subsequent HBO special, \u201cGarth: Live From Central Park,\u201d was nominated for six Emmy Awards and drew the year\u2019s highest ratings for a music program.That event, in fact, set the bar so high for Mr. Brooks that since he returned to regular touring in 2014, following a 16-year hiatus to focus on raising his children, he said he hadn\u2019t really considered coming back to New York for a show.\u201cHow do you come back there after playing Central Park?\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cNo one was more surprised by that than me,\u201d he said of his 1997 reception.But this weekend, Mr. Brooks \u2014 the top-selling solo artist in United States history, with 136 million albums sold \u2014 will be back in town, playing Yankee Stadium on Friday and Saturday nights. (There were some tickets left on Monday, according to Ticketmaster.) He will be the first country artist to perform there.Mr. Brooks, 54, is a passionate baseball fan who has put in spring training stints with the New York Mets, the San Diego Padres and the Kansas City Royals. He likened performing the coming shows to playing at the Grand Canyon. \u201cIf you list the wonders of the world, Yankee Stadium is on that list,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are places you play where the name is much bigger than the artist who\u2019s playing.\u201d\u201cGarth has always done things his own way,\u201d said Gary Bongiovanni, editor in chief of Pollstar, which tracks the concert industry, in a phone conversation. \u201cMost artists announce a full tour, but he eases it out, market by market. There\u2019s not a big national buzz, but it\u2019s huge news in each city as he announces.\u201dMr. Bongiovanni, who compared the approach to Prince\u2019s latter-day \u201chit-and-run\u201d concerts (shows with little advance notice), noted that Mr. Brooks had always been known for meeting demand in each market by playing multiple shows with cheap tickets. \u201cFans recognize that,\u201d Mr. Bongiovanni said, \u201cand he built up a tremendous amount of good will.\u201dThe New York shows, the only stadium dates of the tour so far, required more preparation, and were announced at a news conference in May. (He was rehearsing with the bigger staging in a Las Vegas ballroom last week.) Still, Mr. Brooks views the Yankee Stadium concerts as consistent with a strategy he learned from working with the casino and hotel magnate Steve Wynn on a periodic weekend residency in Las Vegas he began in 2009.\u201cWith entertainment in Vegas, the destination is everything,\u201d Mr. Brooks said. \u201cBut touring is the opposite \u2014 you announce the routing, and people know what\u2019s coming. What we\u2019re doing is making the places each become their own destination. People plan vacations and parties around shows, and the whole attitude is completely different.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never had crowds like these,\u201d he said of the atmosphere at the performances. \u201cAnd to say that this late in my career would have seemed impossible.\u201dJohn Foxx, program director of the New York country radio station Nash FM 94.7, said that the music of Mr. Brooks remained a staple for the genre\u2019s local fans. \u201cWe play a bunch of his songs every day,\u201d Mr. Foxx said in a phone interview. \u201cGarth is a big part of the foundation of our station.\u201d (Mr. Brooks said that, unlikely as it may seem, New York City is consistently one of his biggest markets for record sales.)For the New York shows, Mr. Brooks said that he was partly inspired by Billy Joel\u2019s 1990 \u201cLive at Yankee Stadium\u201d concert documentary, and that he would be filming this weekend\u2019s performances, though he doesn\u2019t yet know how they will be shown.\u201cWhat does \u2018broadcast\u2019 even mean anymore?\u201d he said. \u201cThe beauty now is that you shoot and see what you get, and then see which format it fits.\u201dAlmost 20 years later, Mr. Brooks still sounds a bit awe-struck when he looks back on the Central Park concert. He recounted his tour bus\u2019s pulling up alongside a police officer on horseback as they drove down Fifth Avenue after the show, and the officer\u2019s saying there had been only two arrests the whole night.\u201cThe weather was perfect, the people were perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t come back and try to replicate that.

{"Headline": "Five Dallas Officers Were Killed as Payback, Police Chief Says", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported by12 PhotosDALLAS \u2014 The heavily armed sniper who gunned down police officers in downtown Dallas, leaving five of them dead, specifically set out to kill as many white officers as he could, officials said Friday. He was a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan, and he kept an arsenal in his home that included bomb-making materials.The shooting was the kind of retaliatory violence that people have feared through two years of protests around the country against deaths in police custody, forcing yet another wrenching shift in debates over race and criminal justice that had already deeply divided the nation.Demonstrations continued Friday in cities across the country, with one of the largest taking place on the streets of Atlanta, where thousands of people protesting police abuse brought traffic to a standstill.Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said in New York that there was apparently just one sniper, though there were so many gunshots and so many victims that officials at first speculated about multiple shooters.Searching the killer\u2019s home on Friday, \u201cdetectives found bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics,\u201d the Dallas Police Department said in a statement.Three other people were arrested in connection with the shooting, but the police would not name them or say why they were being held.In addition to the five officers who died, seven officers and two civilians were wounded. The Police Department said that 12 officers had returned fire during a wild series of gun battles that stretched for blocks.During the standoff, Mr. Johnson, who was black, told police negotiators that \u201che was upset about Black Lives Matter,\u201d Chief Brown said. \u201cHe said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.\u201dHe refused to rule out the possibility that more people were involved, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied that we\u2019ve exhausted every lead.\u201dMr. Johnson, who lived in the Dallas area, served as a private in the Army Reserve from March 2009 to April 2015, according to records released by the Pentagon. He was listed as a carpentry and masonry specialist, and served in Afghanistan from November 2013 to July 2014.The sequence of events this week provoked anger and despair, dealing blows both to law enforcement and to peaceful critics of the police, who have fended off claims that the outcry over police shootings foments violence and puts officers\u2019 lives in danger.\u201cAll I know is that this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens,\u201d Chief Brown said.Just hours after President Obama, reacting to video recordings of the shootings in Baton Rouge, La., and Falcon Heights, Minn., spoke in anguished terms about the disparate treatment of the races by the criminal justice system, he felt compelled to speak again, this time about the people who attacked officers.The White House said Mr. Obama would travel to Dallas early next week, at the invitation of the city\u2019s mayor. Later in the week, the president will host a discussion between the police and community leaders to help find solutions to racial disparities and ways to better support police, aides said.Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who was in Washington, said that the week\u2019s violence had left many people with a justifiable \u201csense of helplessness, of uncertainty and of fear,\u201d but that \u201cthe answer must not be violence.\u201d\u201cTo our brothers and sisters who wear the badge, I want you to know that I am deeply grateful for the difficult and dangerous work that you do every day to keep our streets safe and our nation secure,\u201d she said. To the protesters, she said, \u201cDo not be discouraged by those who would use your lawful actions as a cover for their heinous violence.\u201dBut William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, appearing on Fox News, said that there was \u201ca war on cops,\u201d and that the Obama administration was to blame for appeasement of those who attack the police.\u201cOur profession is hurting,\u201d Chief Brown said, calling the actions of his officers nothing short of heroic. \u201cDallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are not words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city.\u201dFive officers were killed and seven others were shot during a protest in downtown Dallas.\u201cI grabbed my shirt because I was close enough, I thought I might have been shot,\u201d said Jeff Hood, a minister who took part in the march. \u201cI was screaming, \u2018Run, run!\u2019\u201dThe violence struck near one of the city\u2019s busiest districts, filled with hotels and restaurants as well as county government buildings, and hundreds of people spent much of the night trapped in buildings that were placed on lockdown.The dead included four officers of the Dallas city police, and one from Dallas Area Rapid Transit.Jane E. Bishkin, a Dallas lawyer who represents five of the wounded officers, said that they were expected to recover, but that one of them, a woman, had suffered a serious injury to her left arm and might be disabled as a result.After Mr. Johnson was cornered on the second floor of a parking garage, negotiators spent hours trying to get him to surrender, Chief Brown said, but he \u201ctold our negotiators that the end is coming and he\u2019s going to hurt and kill more of us, meaning law enforcement, and that there are bombs all over the place in this garage and downtown.\u201d\u201cThe negotiations broke down, and we had an exchange of gunfire with the suspect,\u201d the chief said. \u201cWe saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was.\u201dThe three other suspects were a woman who was taken from the garage and two others who were taken in for questioning after a traffic stop, but they were not providing much information, the chief said.On Friday, a large part of downtown remained off limits to civilians as detectives, and agents from the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, combed through the sprawling crime scene.Chief Brown suggested that the gunman had some knowledge of the march route.\u201cHow would you know to post up there?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have yet to determine whether or not there was some complicity with the planning of this, but we will be pursuing that.\u201dBut Dominique R. Alexander, a minister and head of the Next Generation Action Network, who said he had planned the march, said his group did not condone any violence.\u201cI was right there when the shooting happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could have shot me.\u201dManny Fernandez reported from Dallas, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Jonah Engel Bromwich from New York.

Mr. Gebhard had \u201cmade a series of threats\u201d before going to the house, the police said. \u201cThese threats were from the suspect to the family as well as uninvolved members of the community.\u201d\u201cHe walked over there and into a gunfight,\u201d Mr. Brogan was quoted as saying, drawing on accounts offered by friends of his nephew.The police said in a statement over the weekend that the two men knew each other from a church group. When Mr. Gebhard showed up at the house of the officer\u2019s relative in Lakeshire, St. Louis County, he repeatedly rang the doorbell, banged on windows and doors and demanded to enter.He then went to the backyard, picked up a large, concrete planter and threw it through a rear door, shattering it, the statement said. He went inside, where the officer\u2019s wife, mother-in-law and two children had barricaded themselves in a room.The off-duty officer was also inside, and gave a series of verbal commands to Mr. Gebhard, which he ignored, the police said.\u201cFearing for his life and the lives of the others in the home, the off-duty officer shot the suspect,\u201d the police said. The newspaper quoted the police as saying that the officer said \u201cget down, get down, get down\u201d before firing.Mr. Gebhard was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.Mr. Gebhard was biracial. The race of the officer, a three-year veteran, was not immediately known.Mr. Gebhard\u2019s uncle, Mr. Brogan, told The Post-Dispatch that his nephew supported the Black Lives Matter movement but was not an active participant in the protests. He said Mr. Gebhard, who was from Affton in St. Louis County and was a student at Southeast Missouri State University, also suffered from bipolar disorder.Mr. Gebhard\u2019s Facebook page contains posts about police shootings of black men and about the deaths of five officers in Dallas. Some posts warn of a \u201crace war\u201d and others call for solidarity between black and white people.But family members still have questions about what happened, especially as to how big a component his mental illness and possible lack of medication played in the episode.\u201cWe are still putting the pieces together,\u201d said Linze Zarzeck, the wife of Mr. Gebhard\u2019s godfather. \u201cHe had a very supportive and loving family who have all been familiarized with this illness and have given him support.\u201dMr. Brogan said the circumstances of his nephew\u2019s death are all the more painful because several members of his extended family are in law enforcement.\u201cWe are sick for both families because it was senseless,\u201d Mr. Brogan said, according to the newspaper. \u201cIt was a senseless death.\u201dMr. Brogan could not be reached by telephone or email early on Monday.Advertisement"}

Like many Indonesians, he has only one name.Echoing his concerns, Yuddy Chrisnandi, director of the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform, barred all civil servants via his Twitter account from playing Pok\u00e9mon Go while on duty inside government buildings. He said doing so could compromise state secrets.And on Wednesday, members of Indonesia\u2019s armed forces and National Police were also barred from playing the game while on duty, with their leaders calling it a security threat, according to local news reports.The leaked advisory, according to the publication, stated that the C.I.A. had done the same thing with Facebook.Juwono Sudarsono, a former Indonesian defense minister, cast doubt on the claims, saying the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency \u201cwas unlikely to spend billions to spy on Indonesia,\u201d with which Washington has strong diplomatic, economic and security relations.In addition, the city\u2019s governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, has suggested holding an event where Pok\u00e9mon Go gamers play inside City Hall to help promote tourism.Pok\u00e9mon Go has not been officially introduced in Indonesia, meaning gamers in the country are using unauthorized apps to play \u2014 including the government officials.Some security experts and analysts are skeptical that the game poses a threat to national security. They instead point to xenophobia among Indonesia\u2019s security forces dating to the country\u2019s independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.\u201cIt\u2019s the mind frame of the military itself \u2014 them not understanding what Pok\u00e9mon really is, and about the technology,\u201d said Yohanes Sulaiman, a lecturer at the Indonesian Defense University. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of their paranoia.\u201d\u201cThey believe in this idea of proxy war,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enemy is not there to attack us directly; they want to brainwash us \u2014 young teenagers \u2014 who are focusing on Pok\u00e9mon and forgetting their duty to defend the country.\u201dIndonesian politicians and security officials over the decades have frequently pushed the theory that the country is under constant threat from its Southeast Asian neighbors, as well as the West.In March 2015, Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo, the Indonesian army chief at the time who is now the commander of the country\u2019s armed forces, declared in a speech that there was a \u201cproxy war\u201d being waged by foreign elements to steal the country\u2019s territory and get the nation\u2019s youth hooked on drugs.In 2008, the country\u2019s health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, suggested that the United States was leading a conspiracy to develop the bird flu virus into a biological weapon and leave developing countries that need vaccines at its mercy.Robertus Robet, a sociology lecturer at the State University of Jakarta, said that Indonesia\u2019s security forces, even more than 15 years into the country\u2019s transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, continue to \u201cproject their own fear into some empirical objects such as a game like Pok\u00e9mon.\u201dYet, there has been at least one security lapse.On Monday night, a French citizen working in Indonesia was temporarily detained after stumbling onto the grounds of a military base in West Java Province while searching, he said, for Pok\u00e9mon figures.He was eventually released, according to local police officials.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Upsets Londoners Who Find Harmony in a Cultural Cacophony", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byBoth had voted to stay in the union, sharing the opinion of 60 percent of Londoners but not Britain as a whole, as the Leave campaign beat Remain, 52 percent to 48 percent. Brexit is a bracing reminder, the two said, of how different London is from the rest of the country \u2014 how it can feel like a world apart, a place unto itself.\u201cBeing here shows that you\u2019re no different to each other,\u201d said Ms. Bahia, 31, an accountant whose parents are Indian, by way of Malaysia. \u201cBut when you come from the regions, sometimes you haven\u2019t been exposed to what it\u2019s like to work with and have friends from different cultures.\u201dAround them, the park was almost a caricature of multicultural London in the summer: a cacophony of people, a riot of accents, all existing harmoniously under the occasional burst of chilling rain.At Speakers\u2019 Corner, the spot near Marble Arch where people have gone for generations to declaim and debate, the topics included Jesus, Muhammad, Scottish nationalism, our sins, our DNA, why we are compelled to go to work and the government plot to \u201cchemistrate the airwaves.\u201d The discussions were good-tempered, if not always fully coherent.\u201cLondon has always been a dream of mine,\u201d said Bilyana Georgieva, 25, who was having a picnic in the park with a friend. She moved to the city from Bulgaria a year ago, she said, and within two days she had found an apartment and a job, as a chef in a vegetarian restaurant.\u201cI have never felt pushed away,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s very welcoming.\u201dBut she and many other Londoners are feeling very odd and alienated these days, as the reality of the vote sinks in and they wonder what will happen to their city if the divorce from the European Union goes through. Much of the Leave vote turned on a desire to limit immigration and restore \u201cBritish values,\u201d while London prides itself on its ability to attract and absorb outsiders.\u201cLondon is like the capital of Europe, and it\u2019s the biggest financial capital in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Lewis, 19, a college student in Bristol. Her London high school had students from all over, she recalled, and the British-born were in the minority.London, she said, \u201cneeds the connections with Europe much more than the rest of the country.\u201d\u201cIf Scotland gets to make its own laws to reflect its own unique politics, why not the capital?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe all know \u2014 and the referendum made clear \u2014 that London has very different politics to the rest of the country.\u201dThe mayor, Mr. Khan, agrees. Many of the city\u2019s affairs are still controlled by the national government, and he has limited authority compared with the mayor of, say, New York. Mr. Khan said he would begin pressing for the same sort of devolved powers that the national government has granted to Scotland and Wales.He also moved to reassure nervous and angry residents that London is at heart an international city. He and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, issued a statement saying they would \u201cbuild far stronger alliances between cities across Europe and around the world.\u201dBut just as the vote has set city against country, it has set neighbor against neighbor within the city. There are really many Londons. One is rich, cosmopolitan London, the London of the financial district, of wealthy areas like Mayfair, Hampstead and Kensington, of people who can afford to travel across Britain, Europe and the rest of the world, of immigrants who have prospered.Another is the London of longtime residents like Charmaine Williams, 55, a government social worker. Ms. Williams said she had not seen any advantages to European Union membership, only more people coming from Eastern Europe and using London\u2019s already stretched public services. So she voted yes to Brexit.\u201cThey should fix things at home before they try to fix everyone else,\u201d Ms. Williams said.A series of devastating budget cuts in recent years under the government\u2019s austerity plans has taken a toll on her work, she said.The Brexit question is complicated, said Ms. Lewis, the college student. To denounce those who voted to leave as ignorant and shortsighted, she said, is to think you are smarter and more enlightened, to pit the city not just against the rest of Britain but also, in a way, against itself.She does not want to feel that way, yet she cannot shake the sense that London \u2014 or, at least, her London \u2014 is truly different from everywhere else.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be seen as superior, or trying to lecture them about what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that I\u2019m apart from the rest of the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Silicon Valley Really Do Anything to Stop Police Violence?", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyThe technology world prides itself on being a catalyst for this kind of social movement: Iran\u2019s Green Movement, the Arab Spring and the Maidan protests in Ukraine all, to varying degrees, coalesced with help from American-made social-media platforms. People in tech love to see their work as embodying the \u201chacker ethos\u201d: a desire to break systems down in order to change them. But this pride can often be conveyed rather clumsily.For example, Marc Benioff, the chairman of Salesforce, posted a photo of the activist DeRay Mckesson being arrested in Baton Rouge while wearing a Twitter-branded T-shirt (\u201c#StayWoke\u201d), alongside the triumphant caption \u201cAmazing to see tech as vehicle for social change. Respect.\u201d (He later deleted the tweet and apologized.) Twitter put out a call for an artist to paint a \u201c#StayWoke\u201d mural at its New York offices and offered a stipend of just $2,000. Even Uber temporarily changed some of the black-car icons in its app to tiny peace signs, and showed the message \u201cone minute to reflect on gun violence\u201d to users who were waiting for a ride. Many of these companies voicing support for Black Lives Matter employ vanishingly small numbers of black people. Their reflexive back-patting felt mostly like P.R. \u2014 efforts to claim the mantle of disruptive change without actual disruption.Amid all of this, one conversation in particular stood out. It was a dialogue between Shervin Pishevar, a well-known Silicon Valley investor, and a handful of his peers on Twitter. Pishevar, a founder of Hyperloop One \u2014 a company trying to develop Elon Musk\u2019s futuristic mass-transit concept \u2014 brainstormed an idea for an application to curtail the number of police shootings during traffic stops.It was one of the few direct acknowledgments from the valley that police brutality is a problem worth trying to hack or disrupt. In a phone interview a few days after his tweets, Pishevar said of his valley colleagues, \u201cIt\u2019s just not their reality.\u201d Truth be told, it\u2019s not Pishevar\u2019s either: He has raked in millions from early strategic investments in Uber, Airbnb and Postmates, among others. But as an Iranian-American youth in Maryland, where he grew up, Pishevar knew intimately how unnerving it could be to interact with the police. According to Pishevar, on a Fourth of July many years ago, he and his friends set off some fireworks after a game of tennis. Later, as he was putting his racket in the trunk, he heard a voice behind him: \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d It was a cop, and he was aiming a gun at him. Pishevar was terrified. The officer questioned him and then eventually let him go.He had largely buried his memory of the incident, until he watched chaos erupt around the country after another pair of killings at the hands of police officers. \u201cLike everyone else, I was moved,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just trying to find new ideas out of desperation. We need a new process.\u201d He also has two nephews who are part African-American. He worries most about the older one. \u201cHe\u2019s 16 and just learning to drive. It could have been him.\u201dPishevar has been working with a handful of designers and activists to develop his concept: an app that combines file sharing (for license and registration information) and video chat, so both cop and citizen can communicate with each other during a traffic stop. No face-to-face contact would be necessary unless there was cause for an arrest. Pishevar\u2019s thinking is that such an app would vastly reduce the number of times a jumpy police officer ends up standing at a window with a gun pointed at the driver\u2019s face. It\u2019s still in development, and the prototypes are charmingly rough: The demo images look like a particularly warped Lego universe, all blocky cars and dotted lines to indicate interactions happening from a safe distance.Pishevar\u2019s heart may be in the right place, but his success is contingent on factors beyond his grasp. For his app to catch on, it would require the wholesale buy-in of both police forces and civilians. Similar efforts have failed in the past. Over the past few years, the American Civil Liberties Union built an app that would allow people to report police misconduct directly to the organization. Like so many mobile apps, it never took off. Technology can be part of a solution, but it takes far more than software to usher in reform.Even with evidence as stunning as the recordings of Sterling and Castile, accountability is hardly a given. And it may even become more difficult to secure. Against the backdrop of mourning and protest, Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina signed a bill to block the release of footage captured on police dash and body cameras in future shootings.Many critics of Silicon Valley question whether the industry is really doing all it can to influence policy on this issue. \u201cWe know what it looks like when tech cares, and it doesn\u2019t look like peace signs in the Uber app,\u201d said Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur and activist. Dash cited the example of FWD.us, the initiative for immigration reform led by tech executives like Zuckerberg. He also cited a colossal joint effort among websites like Tumblr and YouTube to stop two anti\u00adpiracy bills in 2011. The latter effort was able to persuade 10 million people to ask their representatives to protest the bills, which were ultimately killed. The tech industry knows how to lobby Washington on issues that affect its bottom line, but it limits its engagement with other issues to grandstanding. Or as Dash puts it, more bluntly: \u201cTech only cares about black people as consumers.\u201dUltimately, what the tech industry really cares about is ushering in the future, but it conflates technological progress with societal progress. And perhaps all of us have come to rely too deeply on machinery and software to be our allies without wondering about the cost, the way technology doesn\u2019t fix problems without creating new ones.In a way, this confusion reminds me of an Isaac Asimov short story \u2014 a popular one in the valley \u2014 called \u201cThe Last Question.\u201d In it, there exists a powerful computer that evolves until it is so omnipotent, and so invisible, that \u201cthe question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend.\u201d Initially, it feels utopian: The computer figures out energy efficiency and deep-space travel. It even conquers death. But laced within the story\u2019s humor is the hint of something lost: Humans became so dependent on technology that they forfeited all agency to its whims.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Cohen\u2019s firm, Point72 Asset Management, is taking a contrarian view.The firm \u2014 a family office that manages Mr. Cohen\u2019s $11 billion fortune and the personal money of some of its employees \u2014 has doubled the size of its work force in London in the last six weeks after reopening its office here last year.Point72 also is raising its public profile \u2014 including a move into social media \u2014 as it looks to attract its next generation of portfolio managers and analysts in the United States, Asia and Europe.Marc Desmidt, who was recently named Point72\u2019s head of international strategy, said in an interview that London would continue to be a magnet for talent in the fund industry. \u201cTo the extent that some people may be working for firms that are slightly ambiguous in terms of their commitment to London, we see that as an opportunity to stand fast and talk to more people.\u201dPoint72, based in Stamford, Conn., does not manage money for outside investors, and is ineligible to do so until at least 2018 because of a regulatory agreement.William R. Tovey, the new head of Point72\u2019s London office, said in an interview that the market upheaval created by the Brexit vote on June 23 had created investment opportunities, particularly for Point72\u2019s new financial team, which joined the company this month.\u201cIt is an interesting time for them to be looking at opportunities with a clean sheet of paper, without maybe a lot of the baggage that many members of the market are currently carrying,\u201d Mr. Tovey said.Mr. Tovey joined Point72 about two months ago from Barclays, where he was head of its European equities distribution business. He previously worked at UBS and Mercury Asset Management.Simon Head, the head of the financial services practice at the recruitment firm Pure Search in London, said that it was not a particularly buoyant year for hiring in the financial services sector, but that he had not seen financial firms instituting broad hiring freezes since the Brexit referendum.Asset managers who had plans to increase the size of their businesses in London, similar to Point72, are moving ahead with their projects \u201con the basis that this is a long-term business,\u201d Mr. Head said.Oliver Rolfe, the founder and managing director of the executive search firm Spartan Partnership in London, said that the largest global banks had postponed hiring plans and might cut jobs later this year, while smaller firms might wait until fall before moving forward with new hires. Companies, in general, are acting slowly and cautiously in this environment, he said.\u201cIf there are special talent available that a company could hire, that hire will still happen,\u201d Mr. Rolfe said. \u201cThe difficulty now is the quality that is required to make the hires happen is far, far higher than it would be maybe two months ago. If you\u2019re making the very best hire, even in the worst market, you\u2019re still helping the business.\u201dAfter the name change, the company found that potential candidates \u2014 particularly those with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills \u2014 were not as aware of the firm or its philosophy.The company has started a 12-month training program, called Point72 Academy, to teach recent college graduates financial analysis and investment research skills. About 2,000 people applied for this year\u2019s program, and 12 candidates are expected to start at Point72 later this summer. Even more applicants are expected in 2017.Point72 plans to expand its academy to include potential candidates based in Britain and Asia as part of its 2017 class.It also has a 10-week summer analyst program to help undergraduates develop skills that are considered fundamental to its investment process. The firm has 18 undergraduates in its summer analyst program this year.In the hope of attracting candidates who might be considering financial jobs in Silicon Valley, Point72 has added career pages on LinkedIn, Facebook and Google Plus, and is taking out sponsored advertisements on LinkedIn.In the next few months, Point72 also plans to unveil its own YouTube channel, which will feature a series of videos to help potential job seekers understand the firm and what it\u2019s like to work there. The channel is expected to debut on Twitter in the fall.The expansion of the London office has also come as Point72 expands around the world despite not being able to accept outside money until 2018, a condition of its settlement with the S.E.C. earlier this year.The firm is in the process of increasing the size of its Singapore operations and intends to move its New York offices to a new tower in the Hudson Yards redevelopment on Manhattan\u2019s West Side by the end of 2018.\u201cI fully expect that this office can double in size,\u201d Mr. Tovey said, regarding the potential for expansion in London. \u201cThere\u2019s no urgency to do that. The focus is on quality. We still believe that we\u2019ve got a business, an infrastructure and a proposition that is attractive to the most talented people in the market.\u201dNo decision has been made on whether Point72 will seek outside investors once the regulatory restrictions are lifted, said Mr. Desmidt, who also oversees the firm\u2019s three offices in Asia.In April, Mr. Cohen formed a new firm called Stamford Harbor Capital, which can, if it chooses, accept outside capital. For now, no decisions have been made.In keeping with his agreement with the S.E.C., Mr. Cohen will not have a supervisory role with the new firm. Under the agreement, Mr. Cohen would be able to manage outside money and act in a supervisory role again beginning in January 2018.\u201cWhat I say to people is part of my role is to ensure that we have world-class investors and a world-class operating infrastructure, that should we choose to take outside capital, we\u2019ll pass any kind of due diligence on the back of that,\u201d Mr. Desmidt said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ex-Student of Emma Willard School Says a Teacher Raped Her in 1998", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byKat Sullivan decided to come forward now about one awful night at an elite private school 18 years ago after a fellow classmate, long troubled by the episode, contacted her.But just as painful, Ms. Sullivan said, was the response then of the administration at Emma Willard, an elite girls\u2019 boarding school in Troy, N.Y., near Albany. She said that when she told school officials, who knew about the relationship, what had happened, they told her she could either withdraw or be expelled. They then put her on a bus to New Orleans, where a friend of hers lived, the next day.The head of school at the time, Robin Robertson, \u201ctold me that I had two choices because I was not fit to be an Emma Willard girl or woman,\u201d Ms. Sullivan, a 37-year-old pediatric nurse in Orlando, recalled, \u201cand that I was a disgrace.\u201dMs. Sullivan said she was traumatized and confused when the episode occurred, and did not report it to the police. In April, she did report it to the Troy Police Department. Because there is no statute of limitations in cases involving rape in New York State, the teacher could still be charged.The accusations against the teacher and the school have spawned a Facebook group with more than 1,200 members and hashtags like #IStandWithKat on social media. Nearly 600 alumnae ranging in age from 18 to 84 signed a letter to the administration listing a dozen demands, including one that all employees undergo mandatory training on sexual assault and misconduct.Efforts to contact the Troy Police Department, as well as Ms. Robertson and the teacher were unsuccessful.Unlike the other private schools, Emma Willard, founded in 1814, has been the subject of one public accusation \u2014 Ms. Sullivan\u2019s \u2014 though officials have acknowledged \u201creported incidents\u201d from the 1970s and 1990s in letters to alumnae.A statute of limitations prevents Ms. Sullivan from suing the school. Nonetheless, she has asked Emma Willard for an apology and to pay for counseling, among other things.The school declined in a statement to address the specifics of Ms. Sullivan\u2019s allegations, but said it \u201chas apologized in writing directly to Kat.\u201d The statement also said the school was \u201cworking to provide resources to assist Kat in her recovery.\u201dMs. Sullivan said that in its apology, the school had not taken full responsibility for mishandling her ordeal.Amid the furor erupting online among alumnae, school officials said they were taking pains to respond sensitively. \u201cWe feel tremendous compassion and grief for any survivor of sexual assault,\u201d a statement said.In a letter sent to the school, Mr. MacLeish recounted events preceding the rape and after. The letter said that soon after meeting Ms. Sullivan, the teacher began to \u201cgroom\u201d her for \u201csexual favors.\u201d\u201cShe was a vulnerable student in a new school,\u201d Mr. MacLeish wrote, referring to Ms. Sullivan\u2019s transfer in her junior year, \u201cand was highly susceptible to predatory advances from an adult authority figure.\u201dThe teacher had given her keys to his office and apartment, and a faculty member had seen her leaving his residence, according to Mr. MacLeish.A major warning sign came weeks before the rape, Mr. MacLeish wrote. Ms. Sullivan had printed sexually explicit emails from the teacher for herself, but they were found by students who turned them over to an administrator, according to Mr. MacLeish. He wrote that the administrator simply admonished Ms. Sullivan, who had turned 18, to \u201cbe careful.\u201dDespite the school\u2019s policy against relationships between students and faculty, the only punishment the teacher got was removal as a chaperone for a trip to Ireland, Mr. MacLeish said. That infuriated the teacher so much, Mr. MacLeish said, that he became even more sexually aggressive.The morning after the rape, Mr. MacLeish wrote, Ms. Sullivan received an angry phone call from a former student with whom the teacher also had a relationship. A classmate of Ms. Sullivan\u2019s had apparently told the former student, and so Ms. Sullivan went to the classmate\u2019s dorm room and vandalized a few of her belongings, Mr. MacLeish wrote. Soon after, still bleeding from the attack, Ms. Sullivan was summoned by school officials. It was then that she told them she had been raped.\u201cAt no time did any of the adults in the room offer to provide medical assistance to this rape victim, or refer her to a mental health counselor or the police,\u201d Mr. MacLeish wrote in the letter, to Dr. Susan Groesbeck, the acting head of school.Rather than releasing Ms. Sullivan into the care of her parents in Georgia, school officials failed to tell them about the episode, Mr. MacLeish said, and instead told them that she had destroyed property and then chosen to drop out.The teacher whom Ms. Sullivan said raped her and a second teacher were fired within two weeks of Ms. Sullivan\u2019s departure. In a letter sent to the school community, Ms. Robertson, the head of school at the time, wrote that the teachers had \u201coverstepped the carefully defined and articulated boundaries for faculty-student interaction.\u201dThe Daily Gazette reported the dismissals at the time. The article said that the Troy police had looked into the relationships and found no criminality, but Ms. Sullivan insisted that she was never contacted by the police.The school acknowledged to Ms. Sullivan that it had provided a letter of reference to the teacher in 1999, but retracted the recommendation in May this year.Ms. Sullivan said her decision to go public, after the former friend contacted her, was difficult, but empowering \u2014 though she hesitates to use the word.\u201c\u2018Empowered\u2019 is one of Emma Willard\u2019s tag lines, so I\u2019m not sure I can identify with that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been able to find my voice. There\u2019s a lot of this that is painful for me. There are things that embarrass me. But I\u2019m above that; this needs to be told.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a woman who said she was raped in 1998 while a student at the Emma Willard School misstated part of the name of a newspaper that reported the dismissals of two teachers at the school in connection with the student\u2019s accusation. It is The Daily Gazette, not The Troy Gazette.Advertisement"}

Mr. Dawood said he thought the second explosion may have been set off by the first.\u201cIt was a busy road,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were many cars, and there were generators that feed the area with power; this is why the damage and death toll were so high.\u201dThe Islamic State issued a statement calling the attacker a martyr, but it stopped short of directly claiming responsibility. The statement made reference to only one explosion.A humanitarian crisis has also been intensifying in Aleppo, a large city that is divided between rebel and government forces.Unicef said on Tuesday that four hospitals in the eastern section of the city, as well as a blood bank, had been hit by airstrikes over the weekend, \u201cdisrupting key lifesaving health services for up to 300,000 civilians.\u201dA 2-day-old baby died in an incubator from disruptions to his oxygen supply as a result of airstrikes that damaged a Unicef-supported hospital, which was reportedly struck twice in less than 12 hours.\u201cAll hospitals hit over the 48-hour-period are in the Al Shaar neighborhood, a location with several health facilities in close vicinity to one another,\u201d Unicef said. \u201cThese hospitals make up half of all health facilities operating in the area.\u201dAt least 60 percent of public hospitals in the country have closed or are only partly functional.In the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo, at least six more people died in airstrikes on Wednesday, according to a medical group operating in the area.

{"Headline": "With Competition in Tatters, the Rip of Inequality Widens", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe Justice Department is expected to rule soon on the biggest beer merger ever: a $100 billion-plus combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller into a colossus that will reap some $3 out of every $10 spent on beer around the world.The stakes are higher than whether you will be able to find your favorite Belgian-style lambic at the corner store. The new merger amounts to another step in the long decline of competition in many American industries.It is a decline that stunts entrepreneurship, hinders workers\u2019 mobility and slows productivity growth. Slowing this trend has emerged as a tempting new avenue to address the plight of a beleaguered working class. Reviving flagging American competition might even help stop America\u2019s ever-widening inequality.Monopoly rents \u2014 the excess returns a company reaps when it does not have to deal with pesky competitors keeping prices down \u2014 could worsen inequality in a variety of ways. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate from Columbia University who served as top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, has asserted that exorbitant corporate profits are being run up through oligopolies and passed along to stockholders, raising the share of national income accruing to the rich.This may not fit snugly with the data, though. Notably, the rising share of income going to the top 1 percent is not driven mainly by overstuffed returns on investment but by the growing inequality in wages. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag suggest a different mechanism to fit this trend: Companies that reap monopoly rents are paying their workers more, sharing some of their rents with them. While that might sound a bit more egalitarian, it could be equally insidious.There is plenty of evidence that corporate concentration is on the rise. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag report that between 1997 and 2007 the market share of the 50 largest companies increased in three-fourths of the broad industry sectors followed by the census.In 1985 the top 10 banks had under 20 percent of banking assets. By 2010 they had more than half. Big Pharma too has become bigger, buying niche laboratories. So have hospitals: Between 2010 and 2014 there were 457 mergers in the hospital sector.Studies have found increased concentration in agricultural businesses and wireless communications as well. And as Senator Warren observed, critical technology markets are often controlled by a single player. Among airlines, there are only four major United States carriers left.Martin Gaynor, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief economist at the Federal Trade Commission, noted that competition policy was about increasing the economy\u2019s efficiency, not changing the distribution of the spoils. \u201cI don\u2019t think antitrust is a major tool for addressing inequality,\u201d he told me.Still, it would seem foolhardy to ignore the growing footprint of dominant companies, strutting their stuff across the broader economy.The existence of Facebook might provide an incentive for some kid in a garage to design a cool new app for the social media giant. But Facebook might also have an interest in squelching innovations that do not fit its business model.Market power can throw sand in the economy\u2019s cogs in several ways. For one, it will make more sense for dominant companies to focus on protecting their rents than to risk money investing in new ventures. New entrepreneurs will think twice before trying to challenge a dominant firm.How did the American economy get so concentrated? Technology surely helped. Tech giants like Google and Facebook benefit from economies of scale and network effects. It costs nothing to serve an additional search. Consumers will be drawn to the social media platforms that already have more users.Government watchdogs also messed up. Concerned only about local competition between bank branches, they allowed a huge nationwide concentration. \u201cAntitrusters stood by and sucked their thumbs while these mergers got through,\u201d Professor Scherer told me. Conditions imposed on troublesome mergers \u2014 like orders to sell assets or to refrain from certain behaviors \u2014 were mostly ineffective, Professor Kwoka said.How to fix it? Professor Kwoka suggests that when a given industry is already fairly concentrated, any future merger should be presumed to be anticompetitive, taking the burden of proof off the regulator\u2019s shoulders and putting the onus on the merging companies to prove it is not. Regulations also offer a promising tool: How about demanding that the Food and Drug Administration approve generic drugs more quickly?But what might help most is not some narrow change in the procedures to examine business combinations but a broadening of the objectives of competition policy. Antitrust economists might hate this idea, but perhaps it\u2019s time to broaden the discussion beyond how a decline in competition may hurt consumers, and to consider things other than narrow economic efficiency. That would include the way market concentration affects the distribution of the fruits of economic growth. It\u2019s not just about the price of beer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The South African photographer Santu Mofokeng knows that the photos you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see can matter just as much as the ones that dominate the historical narrative. He began as a teenaged street photographer during the early 1970\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Soweto, working as an itinerant portrait photographer. He found work as a darkroom assistant and freelance photojournalist but soon grew disenchanted with what he saw as the agenda-driven orientation of some colleagues. Most news stories only covered the era\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violence and brutality. But Mr. Mofokeng was determined to also show his subjects as dignified people who, despite the repressive regime, were resilient, and whom he featured in photo stories filled with hazy black-and-white images that were surreal, haunting and spiritual.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn many ways, what renders Santu\u2019s narrative \u2014 or more properly his narratives about South Africa \u2014 is the singular nature of his vision, its sensitivity and even the way it is delicate without being weak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Johannesburg gallerist Monna Mokoena, founder of Gallery MOMO. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSantu\u2019s great secret is that he is a poet who uses the camera to tease out of life its deepest meanings. For Santu the individual isn\u2019t some forlorn island but an organic part of his or her community. He knew that individual life could magnify the joys and the pains of a community much more poignant than scenes of brutality.\u00e2\u0080\u009dNot quite fitting the mold of a photojournalist, Mr. Mofokeng started seriously documenting life under Apartheid in 1985 when he joined Afrapix, an influential photographers\u2019 collective which fought Apartheid by presenting documentary photographs on the resistance movement and social conditions in 1980s South Africa. He was able to pursue his ideals in earnest in 1988 when he joined the staff at the Institute for Advanced Social Research (formerly the African Studies Institute) at the University of the Witwatersrand as a documentary photographer and researcher. There, he had free rein to tell the stories he wanted, with a position that gave him stability, a platform and, most importantly, the freedom from having his images used for what he saw as mere propaganda. Under Apartheid, black South Africans weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed to live in the cities; townships were created for them on the outskirts. All of the jobs, blue-collar or domestic, were in the cities, and the train-and-bus commute from the townships could take two hours. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrain Church\u00e2\u0080\u009d documents that journey, in which commuter trains were packed and dangerous, especially on payday. People sometimes tried to catch a free ride or, for thrills, would hang onto the sides of the train. Worship services often broke out spontaneously, with bells, singing and preaching. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe atmosphere is quite challenging for a photographer, with not much light and close quarters, but you feel a part of the scene and you can get a sense of the ambivalence of the commuters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Chuang. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a straightforward narrative. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his first mature photo essay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Only 15 or 16 images from this series had been printed before the book, which is expanded with a narrative that explains the journey. It includes, for example, pictures of people walking along the tracks, since the poorly-maintained trains often broke down and passengers had to get off and finish their commute on foot.\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Train Church\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a good example of the kind of oblique, intimate narratives that people in the townships are familiar with but that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the typical narrative disseminated to the outside world during those tough times,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Chuang said.  \u201cImages mostly were of police arresting and killing black people for various infractions. Santu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pictures tell a narrative that is not fixed to any particular moment in history, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a timelessness about them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The next three volumes form a loose, intimate trilogy:  They describe how the residents of Bloemhof unwind in \u00e2\u0080\u009cConcert At Sewefontein\u00e2\u0080\u009d and bury one of their own in \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuneral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The book \u00e2\u0080\u009c27 April 1994\u00e2\u0080\u009d commemorates perhaps the most momentous day in South African history, its first free elections.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat struck me was the mixture of confidence and apprehension,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mofokeng wrote about that day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn uneasy sense of euphoria pervaded the atmosphere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a combination of anticipation and dread, excitement and anxiety. Rumors abounded \u2026 On the question of democracy, I cannot help but recall the old National Party slogan that resounded across the country when Prime Minister Verwoerd was laid to rest: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let the loudmouths and the opposition shout, the white man remains boss.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 This is still true in Bloemhof, which is feudal but in name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Setting out to differentiate his unique presentation and storytelling method, Mr. Mofokeng has become a legend and an inspiration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA common thread in all of the books is the way he tells the story of everyday life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Chuang said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike any kind of depiction of reality, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a metaphor of storytelling in his work, visual narratives he hopes that are passed down throughout generations when people ask: what was it like to be Black in South Africa in the mid 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I think Santu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work will be a part of one of the great records of that reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fayemi Shakur is a writer based in Newark.

{"Headline": "Brazil Is Confronting an Epidemic of Anti-Gay Violence", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byIn a nation seemingly inured to crime, the brutal killings stood out: The victims were not robbed, the police have yet to identify any suspects, and all of the dead were either gay or transgender.\u201cAnd these numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg of violence and bloodshed,\u201d said Eduardo Michels, the group\u2019s data manager, adding that the Brazilian police often omit anti-gay animus when compiling homicide reports.Such statistics can be hard to square with Brazil\u2019s storied image as a tolerant, open society \u2014 a nation that seemingly nurtures freewheeling expressions of sexuality during Carnival and holds the world\u2019s biggest gay pride parade in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.Here in Rio de Janeiro, host to the coming Summer Olympics, fear of violent crime is on many people\u2019s minds. Amid a crushing recession and soaring unemployment, street crime is up 24 percent this year and homicides have increased by more than 15 percent.At the same time, human rights activists say members of the Rio police force, eager to clean up the city ahead of the Aug. 5 opening ceremony for the Games, have shot dead more than 100 people this year, most of them young black men living in poor neighborhoods.But advocates say the constant homophobic violence also threatens to upend an idealized national ethos that promises equality and respect for all Brazilians.Brazil\u2019s near-mythic reputation for tolerance is not without justification. In the nearly three decades since democracy replaced military dictatorship, the Brazilian government has introduced numerous laws and policies aimed at improving the lives of sexual minorities. In 1996, it was among the first to offer free antiretroviral drugs to people with H.I.V. In 2003, Brazil became the first country in Latin America to recognize same-sex unions for immigration purposes, and it was among the earliest to allow gay couples to adopt children.Some experts suggest that liberal government policies may have gotten too far ahead of traditional social mores. The anti-gay violence, they contend, can be traced to Brazil\u2019s culture of machismo and a brand of evangelical Christianity, exported from the United States, that is outspoken in its opposition to homosexuality.Evangelicals make up nearly a quarter of Brazil\u2019s population, up from 5 percent in 1970, and religious leaders reach millions of people through the hundreds of television and radio stations they have purchased in recent years.American-style Pentecostal congregations are also playing an increasingly muscular role in Brazilian politics. Evangelical voters have helped send more than 60 lawmakers to the 513-member lower house of Congress, doubling their numbers since 2010 and making them one of the most disciplined blocs in an unruly and divided legislature.Jean Wyllys, Brazil\u2019s only openly gay member of Congress, said evangelical lawmakers, the core of a coalition known as the \u201cB.B.B. caucus\u201d \u2014 short for Bullets, Beef and Bible \u2014 have stymied legislation that would punish anti-gay discrimination and increase penalties for hate crimes.\u201cEvangelicals are getting increasingly powerful and have taken over Congress,\u201d Mr. Wyllys said.Eduardo Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator who served as president of the lower house, once suggested that Congress establish a Heterosexual Pride Day. After a Brazilian soap opera featured a gay kiss, he broadcast his revulsion on Twitter. (Mr. Cunha, who faces allegations that he took $40 million in bribes, was ordered to step down in May.)Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College who studies gay rights movements in Latin America, said much of the homophobia was a reaction to achievements like same-sex marriage.\u201cBrazilians are becoming more tolerant,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the countertrend is that those who remain intolerant and opposed to L.G.B.T. rights are developing new strategies and a more virulent discourse to block progress on those issues.\u201d\u201cThey put civilization and traditional families at risk of destruction,\u201d he said.Conservative politicians have resisted efforts to teach tolerance in schools, and the police have shown little interest in adopting training programs to help rank-and-file officers tackle bias crimes. Victims of anti-gay and transgender violence say they often experience a fresh round of humiliation from the law enforcement authorities, some of whom are openly hostile to requests that they record a crime as bias-motivated.Over several hours, he said, officers at a police station insisted that he had been the victim of a simple robbery because he lost his cellphone and wallet during the chaos. \u201cIn the end, they made me doubt whether a homophobic attack really happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made me doubt if I was in my right mind.\u201dWhen the police arrived, they repeatedly questioned his account and, after he insisted that they record the attack as a hate crime, told him to drape himself over the trunk of their vehicle and assume the pose of a suspect. \u201cThey made me feel like I was a criminal,\u201d he said.\u201cTranssexuals live with constant fear,\u201d Mr. Kvalo said.Even when suspects in homophobic violence are arrested, advocates say, they are often treated leniently. The two men who savagely beat Andr\u00e9 Baliera, a 28-year-old law student, in an upscale neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo were originally charged with attempted murder. Last year, after serving a two-month sentence, the men were ordered to pay a $6,300 fine and released.The fear is palpable for Gilson Borges Reis, 18, a student in Lauro de Freitas, an industrial city in northeast Brazil. Last month, a cousin who had long taunted him for being gay chased him down the street with a kitchen knife, stabbing him in the chest and arms as relatives watched in horror.Mr. Reis survived, and the cousin, an evangelical Christian, was arrested. He has been charged with attempted murder, but was promptly released on bail.The two cousins live on the same street. \u201cHe passes my house and flashes me an awful expression,\u201d Mr. Reis said through tears. \u201cI have no protection. I am afraid.\u201dTania Franco contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

But the rest of the bodies \u2014 hundreds more \u2014 have remained trapped in the hull of the vessel for 14 months. With the ship now taken to shore, those remains will be removed for examination and identification by forensic experts, the Italian Navy said.The recovery project cost 9.5 million euros (about $10.5 million), took two months, and involved robots and remotely operated underwater vehicles. The effort was repeatedly interrupted because of adverse seas and weather, and the technical difficulties of extracting a wooden vessel from a depth of about 1,210 feet. Officials said the effort was important, not only to provide closure to relatives of the dead but also to draw attention to the horrific effects of human trafficking.\u201cI ordered the navy to recover the wreck to bury those brothers and sisters of ours who otherwise would have remained at the sea bottom forever,\u201d Mr. Renzi said. \u201cI did it because we Italians know the value of the word \u2018civilization.\u2019 \u201dThe dead migrants have a \u201cright to be remembered,\u201d he said.Italian firefighters were given the grim task of extracting the bodies from the vessel\u2019s hull and placing them in a refrigerated tent erected on the dock of a Sicilian military base.There, teams of forensic experts will work in shifts to inspect the remains, collecting items that the migrants might have carried and entering photographs and DNA samples into a database, where families may be able to confirm that their loved ones drowned.If the bodies are not claimed, they will be buried in Italy.On Thursday, even as the recovered vessel with hundreds of bodies was being towed toward Sicily, Italy\u2019s coast guard was carrying to shore those of 10 migrants from the waters near Libya. The migrants, all women, had died from either suffocation or being crushed during the sinking of a rubber boat, from which an additional 107 people were rescued.The coast guard also rescued yet another group of desperate people \u2014 116 migrants on a rubber dinghy \u2014 in roughly the same area on Thursday.Almost 70,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, slightly fewer than at this point last year, but with the milder summer weather, the number of arrivals is expected to increase.On Thursday, Italy\u2019s government repeated its call for Europe to increase efforts to save lives.Mr. Renzi has long advocated more financial help for Africa to tackle the issue at the source. Italy\u2019s government has proposed the issuance of \u201ceuro bonds,\u201d backed by the countries of the eurozone. These would finance the management of the migration crisis in countries that have been affected the most, like Italy and Greece, and encourage African countries to develop their economies, lessening the desperation that pushes migrants to risk their lives by fleeing.However, the economic terms of his proposal have so far been opposed by eurozone countries like Germany.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Critics of Police Welcome Facebook Live and Other Tools to Stream Video", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byAfter back-to-back killings of black men by police officers this week, scores of African-Americans declared on social media that they would be equipping themselves with a powerful tool: Facebook Live.Facebook\u2019s new live-streaming service and similar apps, like Twitter\u2019s Periscope, offer the ability to not just record but to broadcast events as they are unfolding.After news of the two shootings spread, many in the active black community on Twitter vowed to begin making live recordings of every interaction they had with the police.Sean Cochran, 34, of Detroit said on Twitter that he would begin using Facebook Live the next time he was pulled over. In an interview, he said that if officers knew that their behavior was being scrutinized in real time, they might be less likely to escalate traffic stops into life-threatening situations.\u201cIf I verbally express to a police officer, \u2018This is live,\u2019 that puts the pressure on them,\u201d Mr. Cochran said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to play by the book.\u201dDiamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of Mr. Castile, said during another Facebook Live session on Thursday that she put the video online to hold the officers accountable.\u201cI wanted to put it on Facebook and go viral so that the people could see,\u201d said Ms. Reynolds, who uses the name Lavish Reynolds online. \u201cI want the people to determine who was right and who was wrong.\u201dMichelle Gross, the president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, based in Minnesota, said the spread of apps that instantly store video online represented a transformation in holding police accountable.Ms. Gross\u2019s group has distributed fliers encouraging residents in the Minneapolis area to download the Bambuser app, which immediately saves video online and protects it with a password. She said her group had heard of police officers confiscating and erasing images from cellphones.Ademo Freeman, the founder of CopBlock, a group dedicated to documenting police actions, said that he had recommended dedicated apps like Bambuser but that Facebook, with more than a billion active users, had a big advantage.This is a collection of the viral footage that has prompted a national conversation about race and policing.\u201cFacebook is something that everybody has, so it is very easy,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cJust because of the sheer number of people and its convenience, Facebook is probably going to become more popular for these types of videos.\u201dJim Pasco, the executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said police officers told they were on live video would probably react in different ways \u2014 some might be more inhibited, while others would proceed as normal. They are only human and telling them they are being broadcast is provocative, he said.\u201cAny recording can ultimately be helpful, but at the same time, it can\u2019t be viewed as D.N.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have that level of conclusiveness.\u201dArthur Reed, the leader of the anti-violence group that released the cellphone video of the Baton Rouge shooting, said the case demonstrated the power that regular people had at their fingertips.Mr. Reed\u2019s group did not use a live-streaming app to capture the encounter, but decided to circulate the footage online to counter reports in which the police said Mr. Sterling had reached for a gun.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to beg the media to come and report on the stories,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cWe can put it out on social media now, and the story gets told.\u201dFacebook Live is typically used for more innocuous, everyday occasions, like a backyard barbecue or a leisurely park stroll.

Making the right ones is crucial, and leaves us with real hope for figuring this out. Making the wrong ones puts that possibility ever further from reach.So does a public debate that assigns us different tribes and warring interests, when almost all of us want the same thing: for the killing to cease and for every American to feel respected and safe.We have disagreements about how to get there, but they don\u2019t warrant the inflammatory headlines that appeared on the front of The New York Post (\u201cCivil War\u201d) or at the top of The Drudge Report (\u201cBlack Lives Kill\u201d). They needn\u2019t become hardened battle lines.\u201cWe have devolved into some separatism and we\u2019ve taken our corners,\u201d Malik Aziz, the deputy chief of police in Dallas, said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \u201cDays like yesterday or the day before \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t happen. But when they do, let\u2019s be human beings. Let\u2019s be honorable men and women and sit down at a table and say, \u2018How can we not let this happen again?\u2019 and be sincere in our hearts.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re failing at that on all sides,\u201d he concluded, expressing a sentiment uttered by public officials black and white, Democrat and Republican, in laments that drew on the same vocabulary.Separate, divided: I kept hearing those words and their variants, a report card for America as damning as it was inarguable.Separate, divided: I kept seeing that in pundits who talked past and over one another, in a din that\u2019s becoming harder and harder to bear.Separate, divided: I kept thinking of Donald Trump and how he in particular preys on our estrangement and deepens it.On Friday he didn\u2019t, putting out sorrowful, thoughtful messages on Twitter and Facebook and announcing his postponement of a speech on economic opportunity that he had been scheduled to deliver. He was otherwise silent, and while that was entirely out of character, it was wholly in line with the shock and confusion that Americans were feeling.A series of videos featuring personal stories that reflect the breadth of experiences in the United States.Hillary Clinton wrestled with that confusion in an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, stressing, \u201cWe can\u2019t be engaging in hateful rhetoric.\u201d Asked if and why she\u2019d be better at dealing with race relations than Donald Trump would, she declined to disparage him. This wasn\u2019t the moment for that.We can\u2019t keep falling into the same old traps. We can\u2019t keep making hasty conclusions, faulty connections. Predictably, there was a recurrence of talk after the killings of five police officers in Dallas late Thursday night that this was the fruit and fault of the Black Lives Matter movement and that cries of police misconduct equal a bounty on police lives.That was a willfully selective interpretation of events. It ignored an emerging profile of the suspected gunman as someone who acted alone, not as the emissary of any aggrieved group.It ignored how peacefully the protest in Dallas began and how calmly it proceeded up until shots rang out. Black and white stood together. Civilians and cops stood together. Those cops were there precisely because they\u2019d been briefed on the demonstration and brought into its planning. They were a collaborative presence, not an enemy one.\u201cWe had police officers taking pictures with protesters, protecting them, guarding them, making sure they was getting from one point to another,\u201d Aziz recalled.And their instincts amid the gunfire weren\u2019t to flee for cover but to run toward its source and to hurry demonstrators out of the way. If we don\u2019t pay full tribute to that, we\u2019ll never get the full accountability from police officers that we also need, and we\u2019ll never be able to address the urgent, legitimate demands at the heart of the Dallas demonstration and others like it.\u201cWe\u2019re hurting,\u201d Dallas\u2019s police chief, David Brown, said during a news conference on Friday morning. \u201cOur profession is hurting.\u201dHe\u2019s black. So are many other officers on the Dallas force, a diverse one with a good record. And he implored everyone to remember that these men and women, in Dallas and elsewhere, \u201cliterally risk their lives to protect our democracy.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t feel much support most days,\u201d he continued. \u201cLet\u2019s not make today most days.\u201dThat appeal was all the more poignant for how it united police and protesters in a desire that no sweeping, damning judgments be made about a whole class of people; that such prejudice be resisted; that such cynicism be renounced.We must be openhearted and coolheaded that way.But we have to be honest, too, and not shrink from the ugliness laid bare by technology and social media \u2014 by the footage of the police pumping bullets into Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., on Tuesday and of Philando Castile bleeding and dying beside his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, on Wednesday in Falcon Heights, Minn. Over and over, Reynolds says \u201csir\u201d to the police officer who shot Castile and whose gun is still visibly pointed toward the interior of the car where both she and her 4-year-old daughter, Dae\u2019Anna, sit. It\u2019s a shockingly intimate portrait of disbelief and helplessness.On Friday morning, Reynolds appeared on CNN and insisted that her story not be seen in isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s about all of the families that have lost people,\u201d she said.\u201cThis thing that has happened in Dallas, it was not because of something that transpired in Minnesota,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is bigger than Philando. This is bigger than Trayvon Martin. This is bigger than Sandra Bland. This is bigger than all of us.\u201dShe added that Friday was Dae\u2019Anna\u2019s graduation from preschool, that Castile was supposed to be there, and that his absence would be hard on the little girl.Reflecting on Castile\u2019s death, Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota asked: \u201cWould this have happened if those passengers would have been white? I don\u2019t think it would have.\u201dIt\u2019s an important question, a defensible guess, and we need to be able to hear and express both without the instant commencement of political warfare, without superimposing particular causes and constituencies over the narrative, as if every new development and every next death were a bludgeon to be wielded.There\u2019s only one cause here: taking the appropriate steps \u2014 in criminal justice, in police training, in schools, in public discourse \u2014 so that each of us goes about our days in as much peace as possible. And the constituency for that is all of America.Among the important choices we\u2019re making is whom to listen to. There are voices out there \u2014 too many of them \u2014 that seek to inflame. There are others that don\u2019t. Three from Dallas stood out.One was that of Mayor Mike Rawlings, who lamented how racial issues \u201ccontinue to divide us.\u201d\u201cThis is on my generation of leaders,\u201d said the mayor, who is white. \u201cIt is on our watch that we have allowed this to continue to fester, that we have led the next generation down a vicious path of rhetoric and actions that pit one against the other.\u201dAnother voice was that of Erik Wilson, the deputy mayor pro tem of the city, who is black. \u201cNo conflict has ever been solved with violence,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s always been solved with conversation. And that is something that we need to focus on.\u201dAnd then there was Deputy Police Chief Aziz, who is also black. Referring to nationwide instances of excessive police force, he said, \u201cWe should be held accountable, and that is what we have a criminal justice system for.\u201dBut of equal importance, he said, was \u201ca real dialogue with the community that we can no longer be separate. We can\u2019t divide ourselves.\u201dSeparate, divided: those words again. They\u2019re our curse right now. Must they be our fate?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Animating van Gogh\u2019s Life With 62,450 Oil Paintings", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byGDANSK, Poland \u2014 A project that daringly set out to bring to life iconic paintings \u2014 many created in just one day \u2014 has proved to be a staggeringly laborious cinematic effort taking years to realize.Of the 95 painters involved, 65 arrive every day at an enormous, sweltering hangar at the Gdansk Science and Technology Park here in northern Poland, to reimagine, amid thick fumes of oil paint, van Gogh\u2019s canvases.Last month, the hangar, filled with rows and rows of cubicles where the artists worked, was mostly silent, except for the sound of fans. Still, the atmosphere was charged.\u201cWhat is happening here may never happen again,\u201d said Hugh Welchman, a British producer who along with his wife, Dorota Kobiela, a Polish painter and filmmaker, has been directing \u201cLoving Vincent.\u201dThe Polish painter Jerzy Lisak, 39, in the last two years alone has painted more than 400 frames, or cels, and he agreed that the huge amount of effort involved may make this the first and last time for such an undertaking.\u201cIt\u2019s clear this is a realization of a dream,\u201d he said, working on a view of a room at the Auberge Ravoux, where van Gogh lived at the end of his life.Ms. Kobiela, who has made several animated shorts in a country that boasts an array of accomplished animators, supplied the vision. After rereading the artist\u2019s letters to his brother Theo, she decided to create an eight-minute painted animation based on van Gogh\u2019s work.\u201cI knew it would be difficult, bordering on crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vincent deserves more than eight minutes.\u201dMs. Kobiela, her face in her hands, still seemed overwhelmed by the project\u2019s magnitude.Ms. Kobiela and her team spent three years developing their painting technique, which they used to reimagine 125 of van Gogh\u2019s works. Live action was also involved. First, actors were filmed, either against a green screen or on sets built to look like the paintings. That footage then became a point of reference for artists, who painted over it with oil pigments, frame by frame.Each of the 1,009 establishing shots in \u201cLoving Vincent\u201d requires a new oil painting. To make the animation look fluid, every second of the nearly 87-minute film needs to consist of 12 hand-painted frames. Creating one frame takes from an hour to two days, which means that a painter may spend nearly a month on a single second of the film.At the end, there will be 62,450 frames, each of them complex oil paintings on canvas.There are, however, tens of thousands of frames still to go and not much time if the film is to be released, as planned, here in October. (The producers want it to be considered for the next Academy Awards.)\u201cThe biggest challenge now is to reconcile maintaining the high quality of painting with our very tight schedule,\u201d Ms. Kobiela said.Then production slowed when the pool of classically trained painters in Poland quickly dried up, and producers needed to look abroad for artists. After the trailer was posted, thousands of portfolios started to pour in from all over the world.Candidates were invited for tests and then 18 days of training, during which they had to master both van Gogh\u2019s style and the animation techniques.\u201cPeople had no guarantees that if they came here from, say, Canada, they would stay,\u201d the producer Sean Bobbitt said. \u201cThey knew we wouldn\u2019t reimburse them for the tickets or hotels.\u201dTiffanie Mang, 24, an artist from Los Angeles with short-cropped hair and green paint smudged on her nose, said she had no idea she would pass the test when she got on a 15-hour flight to Gdansk.\u201cI never traveled alone and lived on my own before, but I had to take this wild chance,\u201d she said on the 10th day of her training. \u201cThis film is going to make history, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Munich Gunman Portrayed as Having Planned Attack for a Year", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byThe gunman, Ali Sonboly, who was the 18-year-old son of Iranian immigrant parents and held both German and Iranian citizenship, had sought refuge in the internet, where he immersed himself in a violent video game and the so-called darknet of encrypted networks, through which the authorities suspect that he acquired the pistol used to carry out the attack.Mr. Sonboly appeared to have begun planning the attack after visiting the site of a 2009 school shooting in Winnenden, Germany, in which 15 people were killed, initial evidence gleaned from his computer showed.\u201cWe found a manifesto of his, in which he considers such attacks,\u201d said Robert Heimberger, the chief of the Bavarian State Criminal Police. \u201cFrom photos we found on a digital camera, we know that he visited the site and took pictures there.\u201dMr. Sonboly was \u201cobsessed with that attack,\u201d Chief Heimberger said.Later on Sunday, the Munich police said they had arrested a 16-year-old Afghan on suspicion of knowing about the planned attack but failing to inform the authorities.The Afghan teenager, who was not further identified, was a friend of Mr. Sonboly\u2019s and went to the police on Friday night and was questioned. But after searching the teenager\u2019s home, the police found conflicting information, leading them to detain the young man.Although most of the victims in Friday\u2019s shooting were also teenagers from the Munich area, the police and prosecutors said they had found no links between them and the gunman. The victims were three 14-year-olds, two 15-year-olds, and individuals ages 17, 19, 20 and 45.The shooting occurred at the Olympia mall, in a neighborhood to the west of downtown Munich. The count of those injured rose to 35, including several who had been injured elsewhere in the city in the panic that followed the attack, officials said.And late Sunday, at least one man was killed and 10 people injured after an explosion near a music festival in Ansbach, Germany, according to German officials.Thomas Steinkraus-Koch, the spokesman for the Munich prosecutors\u2019 office, said initial evidence had not indicated any kind of political motivation for Mr. Sonboly\u2019s attack.Instead, it appeared that Mr. Sonboly had used a Facebook account opened in May under a false name, or the name of a real girl who was not involved in the shooting, to invite people to the McDonald\u2019s across from the mall, promising free food. Five of the victims were found inside the restaurant, two others on the sidewalk in front, one in front of an electronics market and one inside the mall.None of the victims were schoolmates of the gunman or appeared to have responded to the invitation over social media. \u201cNone of those named in the commentary under the posting were among the victims,\u201d Chief Heimberger said.Some reports identified the gunman as David Ali Sonboly, but neighbors in his apartment building said everyone had known him as Ali. His parents remained too distraught to question, Chief Heimberger said.Medical records showed that the gunman had received inpatient psychiatric treatment for two months in 2015 and continued to be seen as an outpatient, Mr. Steinkraus-Koch said. Prescription medication for treatment of depression was found in Mr. Sonboly\u2019s home, Mr. Steinkraus-Koch said, but it was not clear if he had been taking the medication regularly.After a brief altercation with the police, the gunman fired a bullet into his head, Mr. Steinkraus-Koch said. The pistol, a Glock 17, was a former theater weapon that had been restored to be capable of shooting live rounds.Pressed for further details about the weapon and the gunman\u2019s activities on the internet, Chief Heimberger said he knew little about the murky world of the darknet, which is accessible only by certain software and is used by criminals and terrorists to communicate without being detected.Advertisement"}

He also noticed tents set up by protesters who had been staging sit-ins and hunger strikes to demand higher pay. But he quickly learned that the dispute went beyond labor, with tensions dating to the late 19th century, when the French first colonized Tunisia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a question of the economy and social movement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the beginning this village was nothing.

{"Headline": "Driven by Data, Pros and Joes Alike Vie for Cycling Crowns", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byL\u2019ISLE JOURDAIN, France \u2014 The Tour de France pours out pages of standings every day. Not just the daily and overall rankings, but also a variety of secondary competitions for skills like climbing and sprinting.Strava started seven years ago as a place where amateur cyclists could boast and take part in virtual competitions that, say, ranked the best times for climbs up popular hills. Over the last two years, however, a growing number of professionals have joined, allowing the amateurs to see exactly how hard the pros race and train.The company, based in San Francisco, said that about 15 professionals posted every day on the site in 2014. That is up to 50, with about 190 pros using it to varying degrees.The consequences have been good and bad.Because anyone can generally ride the same roads used by professionals to race and train, the pro results on Strava give amateur riders aspirational targets. But in areas where professional races are held or top pros regularly train, local heroes have been dislodged, likely forever, from the top spots.And like much involving the social media world, the embrace of Strava by many pros has created a simmering intellectual property dispute.But most people in professional cycling recognize Strava\u2019s growing popularity and say that by introducing an element of competition, the site has drastically changed and improved training for amateur and professional cyclists alike.\u201cI used it this morning when I rode; it told me how far I went, how much elevation I did, how many calories I burned,\u201d Jim Ochowicz, the president and general manager of BMC, an American team, said Friday outside its black and red bus. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to use. I think it\u2019s really helped people\u2019s performances.\u201dStrava exists in large part because racing bicycles have become prodigious generators of data. About the time they made their debut, handlebar-mounted computers, particularly from the American company Garmin, began using GPS technology to go far beyond just capturing speed and distance. Among other things, they allowed riders to store detailed maps of their ride, complete with elevations.Heart-rate monitors have been common among professional and amateur cyclists for decades, along with devices for measuring their pedaling rate. And over the last five years or so, many amateurs, like the pros before them, have installed special cranks or other systems to measure their power output.Other sites have sprung up to allow cyclists to post all that material. Strava\u2019s breakthrough, however, was enabling riders to designate any stretch of road as a competitive segment. Its software then automatically ranks all users and, on climbs, bestows on the leaders crowns for being King of the Mountain \u2014 or, as more commonly known, K.O.M.\u201cStrava is crack for cyclists,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Correia, an agent who represents several pro cyclists, including some Strava users. \u201cIt really changed how people ride their bikes. You can compete anytime. You didn\u2019t need a number on your back, and you don\u2019t have to be a specific place at a specific time.\u201dCorreia said that for his clients like the Dutch rider Laurens ten Dam, Strava was also a far more effective way to build links with fans than conventional social media like Twitter or Facebook.Lawson Craddock, 24, a rider for the Cannondale Drapac Pro Cycling team, has been a regular Strava user for most of his professional career.He does it partly as a way to reach fans.\u201cAnyone can just log on to Strava and compare their fastest time with my fastest time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can see what kind of training we\u2019re doing, how fast we actually go in these races. It\u2019s just a really interesting perspective.\u201dBut Craddock, a native of Austin, Tex., also uses it to check on the state of his competitors.In Girona, Spain, where he and many other professional cyclists live, Craddock acknowledged that there were regular \u201cStrava battles\u201d among them.Not everyone is interested, however. Mark Renshaw, an Australian who rides for Dimension Data, said that he already had too much social media to deal with and did not need more.But even he acknowledged that Strava was \u201cprobably a great training tool for the average person or even some of the pros.\u201dStrava\u2019s popularity wears better with some teams than others.Ochowicz had nothing but praise for Strava, though he said that BMC had no interest in making any financial deals with the company. But Peter Reef, the communications manager for Giant-Alpecin, ten Dam\u2019s employer, said that his team believed the race and training data its riders post was team property being used without compensation. Giant-Alpecin, along with other teams, is looking at ways to profit from that data.\u201cStrava is just a tool to publish the data, and it can be done by other means as well,\u201d Reef said.Gareth Nettleton, Strava\u2019s vice president for marketing, said the company had been talking to teams about the issue and was sympathetic to their desire to raise money from rider data. But he also suggested that any such money would not be coming from Strava itself.\u201cWe think that Strava kind of brings value to them,\u201d he said, adding that its competitive element and other features made the raw rider data much more interesting. \u201cWe could bring contextual layers. It could potentially be a revenue stream for the teams.\u201dAs for pros bumping mere amateurs down the Strava rankings, Craddock suggested Strava should allow users to filter out pro and race results.Even so, Craddock acknowledged that he felt little remorse about knocking off the amateurs.\u201cWhen I log onto Strava after a race and I see all the little crowns I\u2019ve taken the K.O.M.s for, I don\u2019t really feel bad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it kind of sucks when someone else is out there doing the same thing with my times.\u201dAn article on Sunday about Strava, a data-driven social media site for cyclists, misspelled part of the name of a team that is looking at ways to profit from its riders\u2019 race and training data. It is Giant-Alpecin, not Giant-Alpercin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Glass Ceiling Now Broken, Is U.S. Ready for a Madam President?", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byAbroad in AmericaPHILADELPHIA \u2014 First a black president and now, just maybe, a woman. Karen Willis, an African-American delegate to this week\u2019s Democratic convention here, was exhilarated by the historic possibilities of Hillary Clinton\u2019s election run, viewing it as a natural succession to Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in power. But when it comes to persuading voters, she noted, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gender milestone was the one thing her party was likely to play down.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to offend some of the white men out there who may not take too well to a first woman,\u201d said Ms. Willis, who is from San Diego, citing internal party talking points. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to rub it in their faces that she\u2019s a woman, any more than we rubbed it in their faces that Barack Obama was black. It makes sense.\u201dAs the United States kicks off an unprecedented presidential campaign contest this week, setting Mrs. Clinton against her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, the sensitivities of the country\u2019s gender politics are bubbling to the surface. Americans find themselves confronted with an uncomfortable question: Are they really ready to accept a Madam President?The soaring optimism of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s address to her party in Philadelphia, with its promises of breaking the world\u2019s highest glass ceiling, comes against the backdrop of a contest notable for its misogynistic discourse.Casual prejudices once reserved for the locker room or the bar stool have been projected loudly onto a national stage, mostly from the podium of Mr. Trump, who has variously described women as fat pigs, dogs and slobs, and blamed their menstrual cycles for criticism of him. In particular, he has accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the \u201cwoman\u2019s card.\u201dBeyond Mr. Trump\u2019s schoolboy imprecations, the bilious environment has drawn attention to the more serious issue of the United States\u2019 record of putting women in positions of power.American popular culture celebrates women who combine power and success, like Sheryl K. Sandberg, the Facebook executive whose prescriptions on balancing a high-powered career with family life are received with great solemnity. In government, American diplomats monitor human rights in other nations and can be outspoken against egregious abuses involving women, like acid attacks and honor killings, in poor countries.The gap is most striking in politics. After a surge in female members of Congress in the early 1990s, rates have stalled or fallen back; currently, 20 percent of representatives and senators are women, far below the 30 percent goal set by a United Nations conference on women.In part, experts say, the American system is at fault. The presidential nominating process, with its long and ruinously expensive campaigns, is tougher on nonconventional candidates than the parliamentary system is in many countries. And American politicians are averse to the quotas that helped increase female participation in other countries.Badges and T-shirts deriding Mrs. Clinton in obscene terms or using sexual slurs are common at Trump rallies. But women who have succeeded in Washington also point to deeply ingrained male chauvinism as a powerful impediment to success. Madeleine Albright, the United States\u2019 first female secretary of state, recalled in an interview how she had often encountered more resistance from American colleagues than from the Arab heads of state she had been warned about.\u201cIt was the little things,\u201d she said. When she raised her voice in meetings, \u201cmen would say, \u2018Don\u2019t be so emotional,\u2019 or would drum their fingers on the table and say I was talking too long \u2014 when the men actually talked much longer.\u201dSimilar attitudes endure today, powerful women say.Shamila N. Chaudhary, a former Obama administration official now at New America, a think tank in Washington, said she encountered workplace friction with male subordinates every day.\u201cPeople don\u2019t like women to be leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get angry. It\u2019s always about my demeanor or my tone. I tell them I\u2019m just trying to get the work done.\u201dFemale politicians in other countries hope that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s run will set an example for them, too. Joyce Laboso, the deputy speaker of Kenya\u2019s Parliament, who was in Philadelphia this week, said she had followed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign with a mix of envy and empathy.Back home she, too, had endured taunts from men who questioned her suitability to run for office, or who said she had the wrong husband for the job (although in her case, it was because her spouse is from another ethnic group).\u201cMen say that positions of authority are not our sphere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if Hillary becomes president, that myth will be shattered.\u201dIf she wins, Mrs. Clinton promises more than symbolism.Just as Mr. Trump was accused of using dog-whistle tactics to attack Mr. Obama \u2014 by supporting, for instance, the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories claiming that Mr. Obama had been born in Kenya \u2014 Mr. Trump could well return to attacks based on gender.Surveys show that young people, in particular, do not trust her. Many young female supporters of her opponent in the race for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said they resented being pressured into supporting her on the basis of her sex.\u201cI get it that some people just don\u2019t know what to make of me,\u201d Mrs. Clinton admitted during the convention.The gender debate, both overt and coded, is part of the broader tumult of a campaign that has challenged many core notions of American political identity, and that has been filled with astonishing turns.\u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers have debated how much they should focus on gender in the coming months. Many see parallels with the delicate balancing act of 2008, when the party sought to reassure some voters about Mr. Obama. Ms. Willis, the delegate, said she had been told then that \u201cwe can\u2019t make race an issue, because there are some people out there who might not take well to that.\u201dBut in Philadelphia, at least, Mrs. Clinton owned her historic achievement.Her first appearance, on a video screen, showed her surrounded by the shards of a shattering glass ceiling. During the speeches, some delegates \u2014 men as well as women \u2014 cried openly.\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a long struggle,\u201d Representative John Lewis, a civil rights champion from Georgia, told MSNBC just before Mrs. Clinton was officially nominated. \u201cI cried when Barack Obama was nominated, cried when he was elected, cried when he was sworn in. And I may cry again tonight.\u201dAdvertisement"}
