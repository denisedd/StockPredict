{"Headline": "They Promised Us Jet Packs. They Promised the Bosses Profit.", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byIf the project had been successful \u2014 and this was always a big if \u2014 it would have changed the definition of green energy and potentially undercut some of the most important industries in the world, not least the oil business. But after two years of trying, and an undisclosed research budget, Foghorn died during a January staff meeting.The result: Everyone on the team received a bonus (they won\u2019t say how much).X, formerly called Google X, cheekily refers to itself as \u201cthe moonshot factory.\u201d They are the people behind Google\u2019s self-driving car, along with various out-there projects like Loon, an attempt to beam internet access from stratospheric balloons, and Wing, a drone delivery service. Those efforts sit atop dozens of aborted projects \u2014 some just ideas, others that consumed years \u2014 like a never built jet pack and giant blimps that would haul cargo with the same efficiency as an ocean liner.What all these efforts have in common, besides imaginative power, is that they do not make any money. X\u2019s budget and head count are a secret, but shareholders\u2019 perceptions about the division were aptly summed up by a poster board in its Mountain View, Calif., offices. It had a picture of a burning $100 bill followed by, \u201cInvestors think we do this.\u201dThat poster points to a central question for both X and Alphabet: What exactly is X\u2019s business? And how does a public company invest in such speculative ideas, most of which will never work, without irritating investors or wasting a ton of money?Building a research division is an old and often unsuccessful concept. For decades, corporate giants like AT&T, IBM, Microsoft and Xerox have tried, in varying ways, to organize research-oriented groups in hopes of finding ways to cash in on emerging technologies before their competitors.Those efforts played a role in creating some of the 20th century\u2019s most significant innovations. For instance, Bell Labs, then a division of AT&T, invented the transistor, the foundation of modern electronics. But in many cases these research arms did little for the companies that financed them.Xerox pioneered the graphical interface for computers \u2014 the idea that people could navigate with a mouse rather than typing obscure commands on a screen. But it was a young company named Apple that turned that idea into a giant business.\u201cIn general, the model of having a central research lab that the corporation funds for research into new technologies has not produced much for these companies,\u201d said G. Pascal Zachary, a professor at the Arizona State University School for the Future of Innovation in Society. \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t see many of the successful young companies today thinking about building them.\u201dX is trying to make corporate research systematic by borrowing working ideas from the past, while adding a few wrinkles \u2014 like giving people a financial incentive to admit when something is not working out \u2014 in hopes of not making the same mistakes.This effort comes at a time when Alphabet is trying to enforce financial discipline over a broad empire that was famous for not worrying about nickels and dimes.Next month will be the first anniversary of Google\u2019s surprise announcement that it would remake itself as a holding company. All the ad-driven and highly profitable businesses like search would still be called Google. The assumption was that the other divisions would have to prove they could stand on their own financially \u2014 at least over time.While investors still do not know X\u2019s budget, they at least have a sense of the limits. In the first quarter, Alphabet lost about $800 million on what it called \u201cother bets\u201d \u2014 everything outside Google\u2019s core search and advertising businesses \u2014 and it will update the figure when it reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday.At the same time, now that X is spinning off new companies that will either stand on their own or die, investors are getting something of a yardstick to judge the division\u2019s progress. If one of those new companies starts to rival search advertising as a revenue stream, X will be considered a success. If that never happens, it will be a failure (and not the good kind).For instance, X\u2019s self-driving car project, known internally as Chauffeur, recently hired a chief executive and is poised to become a stand-alone company. Another, called Verily, is a life sciences company that has developed, among other things, a glucose-sensing contact lens for people with diabetes, and has licensed that technology to Novartis. Verily became its own company shortly after Google announced the Alphabet reorganization.\u201cThe thing we created \u2014 our product \u2014 was Verily, and at the highest level we are being paid as an organization to do that somewhat regularly,\u201d said Astro Teller, X\u2019s chief executive, though his actual title is \u201ccaptain of moonshots.\u201d \u201cI would not want to promise anyone internally or externally that we\u2019re going to do it once a year.\u201dThere are two main differences between X and the corporate research arms of the past. While operations like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC worked on problems that were at least nominally related to their parent companies\u2019 core businesses, X employees can work on anything they like. In fact, they are discouraged from straying into Google\u2019s main business because Google has its own research group that focuses on machine learning and other computer science topics.And while Bell Labs and others made huge contributions to basic, university-style research, X projects are conceived as moneymaking enterprises, or things that at least seem as if they could make money sometime in the next few years. With Foghorn, the goal was to turn seawater into gasoline for no more than $5 a gallon \u2014 enough that it could conceivably find a market in some European nations where high taxes make gasoline more costly.Kathy Cooper, an engineer who led the project, said of the goal, \u201cI think we could meet it, but it would be more like 15 to 20 years.\u201d That was too far away, which was why she recommended killing it.X employees avoid talking about money, but it is not a subject they can ignore. They face financial barriers that can shut down a project if it does not pan out as quickly as planned. And they have to meet various milestones before they can hire more people for their teams.The point, several executives said, is to encourage employees to think big while staying away from creating technology for technology\u2019s sake.\u201cIf you actually want to make the world better, focus on what would actually make the world better, and the technology will take care of itself,\u201d Mr. Teller said. In other words, great ideas that solve real problems will bring in real money.One of the more public examples was a recent overhaul of a Google robotics effort whose best-known project is a robotic cheetah. The division was recently dismantled, and its disparate technologies are being re-evaluated so they can either be sold off or streamlined for a specific moonshot idea, like \u201cbuild a car that can drive itself.\u201dOver the last year, X has hardened project milestones and created an intermediate step, called Foundry. The group\u2019s leader, Obi Felten, said her job was to hone new technologies into a concrete product and to work with engineers like Ms. Cooper to help them write business plans.The idea is to create a conveyor-belt-like process that encourages employees to quickly jettison projects that seem unlikely to work and to avoid technologies that are neat ideas but would never make money.One of the best ways to save money, Mr. Teller said, is to encourage employees to kill projects before they become expensive \u2014 hence the bonus for the Foghorn team. X staff meetings begin with a \u201cpremortem\u201d process in which people predict how various technologies might fall short. Employees\u2019 laptops are decorated with stickers of crumpled-up paper that represent the end of past efforts.When Mr. Teller speaks at events like South by Southwest and TED, he ruminates so deeply on the word \u201cfail\u201d that successes are sometimes framed as \u201cfailing to fail.\u201dThe idea of celebrating failure is a Silicon Valley clich\u00e9, but Mr. Teller talks about it in the practical terms of a management consultant. Say you have a team of 20 people working on a project that is not going anywhere, he said in a recent interview. In a year those 20 people will be 30 people. The company has to pay their salaries and health insurance, and the team will inevitably hire a few consultants. Worse, they will have wasted a year.How much money could the company save if you could get them to cut bait a year earlier?\u201cThat\u2019s the magic,\u201d Mr. Teller said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do it. They will not raise their hands and say, \u2018This project is just not what we should be working on,\u2019 unless you start bonusing them, unless they can get a promotion for ending their project.\u201dFailure bonuses are also an example of how X, which was set up independent of Google from the outset, is a leading indicator of sorts for how the autonomous Alphabet could work. In Alphabet, employees who do not work for Mother Google are supposed to have their financial futures tied to their own company instead of Google\u2019s search ads. At X, that means killing things before they become too expensive.Mr. Teller\u2019s decision to start paying bonuses to employees who kill their own projects happened long before the Alphabet transition, and it was met with skepticism from Google\u2019s chief culture officer. Mr. Teller got what he wanted anyway.\u201cThey were just offended by the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we don\u2019t even talk about it anymore.\u201dX was founded in 2010, and it was originally in a brick building on the edge of Google\u2019s main campus. At the beginning, it felt like an extended 20 percent project \u2014 the extra projects Google employees are encouraged to work on outside of their main job \u2014 with little in the way of process.Former Google employees said this led to a temptation to overhype projects long before they were ready. The most notorious example of this was Google Glass, the much maligned computer glasses.The glasses were supposed to have a marketing scheme to match, and X employees hatched an idea for floating showrooms. Later, when mysterious barges showed up in Portland, Me., and San Francisco Bay, they kicked off months of speculation and conspiracy theories until finally they were towed away without a word from Google.Mr. Teller said he shut down the barges idea the first day it was his decision to make. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of agonizing about that,\u201d he said.Today, the company\u2019s offices are a few miles from Google\u2019s main campus. They are full of electric vehicles and people riding skateboardlike contraptions. Mr. Teller appears to be always on Rollerblades.Beyond the main lobby and offices, behind key-card-protected doors, sit various labs, as well as an open warehouse floor that houses a division called the Design Kitchen, which appears to be a cross between a machine shop and a cool dad\u2019s garage. Some items spotted on a recent tour included climbing rope; lots of tools; oversize plugs; a set of skateboard wheels attached to a block, wires and a 9-volt battery; a plastic ear; and beer.Unlike Google, where software engineers are kings, X is run by an eclectic batch of scientists and tinkerers whose backgrounds range from math, physics and chemistry to design, fashion and public art. The line \u201cI\u2019m not an engineer\u201d seems to be a point of pride. Rich DeVaul, who heads a \u201crapid evaluation\u201d team whose job is to hatch and kill ideas in short order, guessed that fewer than half the employees have engineering degrees (he doesn\u2019t).\u201cI would argue that the great strength of X, in fact, is that basically we aren\u2019t just a bunch of techies,\u201d he said.The combination of big ideas, lofty rhetoric and a strict code of secrecy has made X a source of endless speculation and conspiracy theories. The one you hear most frequently, usually from competitors and venture capitalists, is that X is a giant public relations plan to distract regulators from Google\u2019s search business, which is under scrutiny around the world.Cynical though that sounds, it points to something that seems fundamentally true: Many of history\u2019s great corporate research efforts, like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, have come from companies that were monopolies or close to it.Failure bonuses notwithstanding, no normal person would walk away from X thinking it looked frugal. There is a free cafeteria whose recent menu included sushi and pork tri-tip. The bathrooms have Japanese toilet seats with buttons for warmth and spritz. Listening to X executives talk about saving money is a bit like having billionaires tell you they built a $30 million house for $30 million and not a penny more.But X\u2019s success will be less about money saved than the creation of a new Google-size business whose profits wash away all the losses. And while the division has already had some successes, it has yet to produce the \u201cmoonshot\u201d Mr. Teller is hoping for.Arguably the biggest success, Google Brain, is the one people know the least about. It was an artificial intelligence effort that was spun back into core Google in 2012 and is now embedded in products like voice search and the Google Photos app, in which users can search their albums for images like \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmountains.\u201dInvestors would prefer a shiny new business that does not rely on advertising. Mr. DeVaul hopes that if X can deliver a big hit, it will encourage other companies to copy the entire concept. Management science is a lot less interesting than moonshots, but until X hits the moon, that is what it is selling.\u201cWe could have five or 10 other world-class organizations doing this, and we would not be able to scratch the surface of the crazy big hard challenges out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist: I believe that there is an endless supply of huge problems affecting humanity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fully Self-Driving Car Is Still Years Away", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byEven as automakers and technology companies have been promoting a euphoric vision of the future in which cars will drive themselves and serious crashes will be rare, their engineers have been engaged in a sobering debate.Just how autonomous can and should cars become? the engineers are asking. Is there an inherent danger in technology that invites human drivers to sit back and relax \u2014 but still requires them to be ready to hit the brakes or grab the wheel at the first sign of trouble?Those questions have taken on a new urgency after the revelation this week that the driver of a Tesla Model S died in a crash in Florida while the electric car was operating in its Autopilot mode.The man, Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was driving on a divided highway, when a tractor-trailer truck made a left turn and crossed in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s lane of traffic. Tesla said neither Mr. Brown nor the car\u2019s self-driving system noticed the white truck against a bright sky, and the brakes were never applied.For now, other automakers are giving no sign of slowing down their efforts to push forward with cars that can drive themselves. But mainly they say the technology isn\u2019t ready yet \u2014 which for many is an implicit rebuke of Tesla\u2019s willingness to tempt tech-minded drivers to turn tomorrow\u2019s vision into today\u2019s road reality.On Friday, even as the world was absorbing news of Mr. Brown\u2019s death as the first known fatality of the autonomous driving revolution, the German automaker BMW said it intended to offer a \u201cself-driving car\u201d \u2014 but not until 2021. And it will have much different technology than is now available on the Tesla Model S.\u201cToday we are standing at the brink of a new revolution,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, BMW chief executive, said at a news conference in Munich.Mr. Kr\u00fcger added that the Tesla crash was \u201creally very sad\u201d and said BMW would need \u201cthe next few years\u201d to perfect its autonomous driving system. \u201cToday the technologies are not ready for serious production,\u201d he said.The world\u2019s largest carmaker, Toyota, is a notable holdout in the rush toward completely autonomous cars. Last year, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in a Silicon Valley-based research effort to focus on cars that will function as \u201cguardian angels,\u201d saving human drivers from errors, rather than replacing them.Tesla, which started its Autopilot feature last fall, has emphasized in discussing Mr. Brown\u2019s death that the system isn\u2019t intended to take over complete control of the car and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert and engaged.The point highlights the difference in approach that separates companies working on self-driving technology.Ford Motor, Google, Volvo and others are aiming at offering fully autonomous cars that can operate safely without human intervention at all \u2014 an approach engineers call Level 4 automated driving. Those companies are wary of semiautonomous, or Level 3, technology that can drive the car for stretches of road under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to be ready to take over.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is not even a fully fledged Level 3 technology, and some experts say it is a risky approach.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge inherent danger and it\u2019s well proven \u2014 the computer making a mistake and the driver not taking over quickly enough,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice.The trouble is that while semiautonomous systems like Tesla\u2019s are guiding a car, human drivers can be lulled into feeling they are able to turn their attention away from the road. Mr. Brown, like some other Model S owners, posted videos showing the driver with no hands on the steering wheel. In one video, a driver climbs into the back seat.Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending machine company from Connellsville, Pa., owns a 2013 Model S that does not have Autopilot. But he drove a loaner with the feature earlier this year while his was being repaired. He loves his car and has deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when that car is available, yet he is \u201con the fence\u201d about getting Autopilot.While the technology \u201cwas the greatest thing\u201d on closed highways like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it could become confused in more complicated environments like construction zones, Mr. Cordaro said.\u201cMy experience is it\u2019s really not completely safe except in limited-access highways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives you a false sense of security. You get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel but you really can\u2019t. It should be called Auto-assist, instead of Autopilot, because that\u2019s all it is.\u201dEven Amnon Shashua, an executive whose technology is part of Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature, said on Friday that he did not think self-driving\u2019s time had yet come.Mobileye, along with the chip maker Intel, is at work in a partnership with BMW on the self-driving car that the German automaker described in Munich on Friday that is supposed to be available in 2021.Mr. Shashua suggested that self-driving technology was close, but still not quite ready for actual use without human drivers remaining engaged.\u201cFive years is a very short time,\u201d Mr. Shashua said. \u201cOn the other hand, it is a sufficient time to do the types of validations that are needed.\u201dThe BMW car Mobileye is collaborating on will be capable of piloting itself on highways, but not necessarily in complex urban settings.Automakers and technology companies still need to do \u201chundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers of validation and simulations\u201d in closed testing environments to be certain the technology is safe, Mr. Shashua said.\u201cI think it is very important, especially given this accident and what we hear in the news, that companies are very transparent about the limitations of the system,\u201d he said.Although Tesla has publicly said that it has enhanced the Mobileye technology, the company has not commented on whether it has enhanced the system to protect against what the industry describes as \u201clateral turn across path\u201d\u2014 the type of situation in the Florida accident.Others in the automotive industry are working on sensor technologies meant to detect vehicles from all angles.One approach is lidar \u2014 a system that uses rotating laser beams. Lidar is being used in the experimental autonomous vehicle being developed by BMW, as well as those by Google, Nissan and Apple. But it remains unclear whether the laser system will come down enough in price to use in mass-market cars.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Sweetgreen, a Suitcase Full of Cash Won\u2019t Buy You Lunch", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byPatrons of Sweetgreen are very particular about their salads. When the company recently removed bacon and sriracha from the menu, customers took to social media to complain. But after a handful of Sweetgreen restaurants stopped accepting cash in January, barely anyone noticed, according to the company\u2019s owners.Even Sweetgreen executives thought going cashless was \u201ca harebrained idea\u201d at first, said Jonathan Neman, a co-founder and co-chief executive of the company. \u201cBut we looked around and saw that airlines haven\u2019t been taking cash for a while.\u201d At Sweetgreen\u2019s locations throughout the United States, cash purchases have declined to less than 10 percent today from 40 percent of all transactions when they opened their first location nine years ago, he said. Sweetgreen now has 48 locations.Although America is far from becoming a cashless society, cash transactions are less frequent than even a few years ago and some restaurant owners are betting that customers will be comfortable doing away with cash for convenience.Restaurants like Sweetgreen are pushing credit and debit cards and mobile apps for payments. Apps enable restaurants to gather data and feedback, and allow consumers to order ahead and skip long lines.\u201cOne of the biggest complaints at Sweetgreen is the line, so by reducing cash we\u2019re able to serve customers a lot faster,\u201d Mr. Neman said. At the six Sweetgreen locations where cash is not accepted, employees can perform 5 to 15 percent more transactions an hour, he said.In a cash-free environment, employees are also safer, Mr. Neman said. There have been only a handful of thefts and robberies since Sweetgreen has been in business, but he said he believed that going cashless deterred thieves. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s coming in to steal arugula.\u201dThe poor and unbanked are a concern for Sweetgreen, Mr. Neman said. Should the experiment move toward a companywide policy, Sweetgreen is considering solutions to make its products available to those without credit or debit cards. One potential answer is to install gift card machines in select stores where customers could pay cash for Sweetgreen cards, he said.Consideration for the unbanked was among the chief reasons Bozzelli\u2019s Deli & Pizza relaxed its policy after opening a cash-free location in Washington this year, said the owner, Mike Bozzelli.A small group of opinionated patrons led Split Bread, a sandwich chain with two locations in San Francisco, to change its cashless policy about two years after opening in 2012. \u201cWhen we would get negative reactions, they were very, very strong,\u201d said David Silverglide, co-founder and chief executive at Good Food Guys, the company that owns Split Bread. \u201cCustomer preferences are really hard to shift when it comes to something as ingrained as cash.\u201d\u201cI think they were ahead of the trend,\u201d Sam Oches, editor of the quick-service restaurant industry magazine QSR, said of Split Bread. Sweetgreen might have an easier time this year, because of increasing app use and the brand\u2019s popularity. \u201cSweetgreen is very emblematic of the future of the fast-casual industry,\u201d Mr. Oches said. \u201cIf anyone is going to make this work, it\u2019d be them.\u201dGoing cash-free, though, can seem to run counter to restaurant hospitality training. The hardest group to persuade of the benefits of a cashless environment might have been his employees, said Alan Bekerman, the founder and chief executive of iQ Food, a chain of healthy fast-casual restaurants in Toronto. When Mr. Bekerman started discussing his cashless plan with employees, they were aghast.\u201cWe are bred to say \u2018yes\u2019 to everything,\u201d said Mr. Bekerman, who opened two cash-free restaurants in February and plans to convert his three other locations by the end of the year. \u201cBut when we jumped in and did it, there really hasn\u2019t been nearly as much chaos or hate mail or pushback or that stuff that we\u2019re used to getting when we make changes as we expected.\u201dJae Kim, owner of Chi\u2019lantro, a Korean-Mexican fusion chain in Austin, Tex., said his company had always been \u201ctech friendly\u201d since starting a Twitter account so fans could find the location of his taco truck in 2010. After noticing the customers at his trucks and bricks-and-mortar locations gradually switching from cash to cards and services like Apple Pay and Google Wallet, he decided to make his establishments cash-free. \u201cWe grew with our customers,\u201d he said.New technologies often go hand in hand with cashless businesses. Two new locations of the London salad chain Tossed are cashless and cashier-free; customers check out using kiosks with iPads. To avoid confusion, Tossed installed extra lobby hosts, but \u201cpeople don\u2019t want help,\u201d said Vincent McKevitt, the chain\u2019s founder and owner. Mr. McKevitt has begun retrofitting his other 25 locations for cash-free transactions and self-service checkouts.For Major Food Group, which owns restaurants throughout New York, going cashless is simply a business decision.When the restaurant group opened Sadelle\u2019s last year, reviewers raved about the bagels and griped about the prices of sandwiches, but said little about the cashless policy. \u201cIt is not an issue and is rarely ever mentioned,\u201d Jeff Zalaznick, a co-owner and managing partner, said in an email.\u201cI believe very strongly in the cash-free movement,\u201d Mr. Zalaznick said. \u201cThere is an immense amount of work, process and error that goes into taking, processing, monitoring and depositing cash. The amount of time and money that this costs is not worth the amount of business that is done in cash. The fees that you pay on the additional credit card sales are far less than the money you spend internally to take the cash.\u201d Less than 8 percent of sales across his restaurant group are in cash, Mr. Zalaznick said.Sadelle\u2019s isn\u2019t Major Food Group\u2019s first foray into the cash-free movement. ZZ\u2019s Clam Bar, which opened three years ago, is also cash-free.\u201cIt is the way of the future,\u201d Mr. Zalaznick said. \u201cWe are just embracing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After ARM, Is More British Tech for Sale?", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byBitsARM, a decades-old spinout of a British personal computer company, specializes in low-power semiconductor designs, popular in wireless devices. Little of its market is actually in Britain, so it won\u2019t be affected if the United Kingdom has a recession. It doesn\u2019t have higher raw materials cost, something affecting other British companies as the pound fell after the decision to exit from the European Union. The company is well run and doesn\u2019t need fixing.That does make ARM something of a special case. But with the pound down and the dollar and the yen up after the so-called Brexit, it\u2019s almost certain that plenty of bankers working for tech companies are looking to buy. And there are more British assets that could go to foreign hands.If the issue is tech companies that don\u2019t rely on the British economy, there is also Inmarsat, a 37-year-old operator of a global satellite communications network. Its customers are global. ARM\u2019s future, and one reason SoftBank bought ARM, is the growth prospects of the sensor-rich internet of things. Satellite communications, and the communications spectrum that Inmarsat has, also look strong.Perhaps the greatest British tech assets are big phone companies like BT Group or Vodafone, which both operate across scores of countries. Those would be enormous acquisitions, of course; at a dinner with AT&T executives last week, I was told that the telecommunications firm, one of the few that could afford such an acquisition, is not interested.There are other British businesses with large foreign presences, like Shazam, the music service; SwiftKey, which uses artificial intelligence to make phone keyboards easier to use; or a number of companies in cloud computing. Of course, pretty much any company that lives primarily on the internet has no need to depend on a country\u2019s local market, and can easily move many of its assets to another location.There is one more British asset that can easily slip the British market: people with good tech skills. Those are not companies, but they have no problem taking their most valuable skills somewhere else. Of course, many of them already have, at the British offices of companies like Google, Facebook and Apple.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer\u2019s Media Problem at Yahoo Is Now Verizon\u2019s to Solve", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byThere is no doubt that Yahoo made a valiant turnaround effort in recent years. Under the leadership of Marissa Mayer, the company made numerous attempts to improve its core business, with a steady run of acquisitions and investments in new apps and services.But one central aspect of Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategy \u2014 putting major money and attention into Yahoo\u2019s media properties, a wide range of news and entertainment publications and video projects \u2014 always seemed curious. And few people knew why this was a risky strategy better than Ms. Mayer herself. At Google, she had preached the coming challenges of making media on the web; at Yahoo, she lived them.In 2009, Ms. Mayer, then the executive at Google overseeing search products, was invited to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet. The subject: \u201cThe Future of Journalism.\u201d Her message: Fundamental changes are underway, and navigating them will not be easy for media companies.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.Because our mission is to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful, high-quality content is incredibly important to Google. Our most basic goal is to connect users with high-quality and reliable information. Credible, factual, trustworthy content \u2014 that is, journalism \u2014 is critical to the millions of users who search for news stories on Google.Over the years, media companies tailored articles and videos to game Google\u2019s opaque search algorithm. Google encouraged that, because it improved their search results. It also helped drive traffic to news sites.But Ms. Mayer outlined a situation in which most websites were almost entirely replaced as distributors of information, by Google, or Google-like companies. This, she admitted, was a hardship for publishers:When producing an article for online news, the publisher must assume that a reader may be viewing this article on its own, independent of the rest of the publication. To make an article effective in a stand-alone setting requires providing sufficient context for first-time readers, while clearly calling out the latest information for those following a story over time. It also requires a different approach to monetization: Each individual article should be self-sustaining. These types of changes will require innovation and experimentation in how news is delivered online, and how advertising can support it.Even web media companies, she acknowledged, depended on their ability to capitalize on distribution \u2014 to be able to sell their sites, and their audiences, as publications. To concede a direct relationship with readers to Google, or another company like it, is to turn your product into someone else\u2019s inventory, and to risk accelerating any media company\u2019s nightmare: full commoditization.Now the internet has broken down the entire news package with articles read individually, reached from a blog or search engine, and abandoned if there is no good reason to hang around once the story is finished. It\u2019s what we have come to call internally the atomic unit of consumption.This distinctive terminology describing how internet users would get information was in equal parts prophetic and motivated. How Ms. Mayer and Mr. Schmidt described the power of major online platforms \u2014 the manner in which powerful engines like Google profoundly shape the web, and companies, around them \u2014 would have provided a useful way to think about the dominance of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter since.Ms. Mayer\u2019s more specific prescription for how the web of 2009 should develop to accommodate Google, on the other hand \u2014 by creating constantly updated and growing \u201cliving stories\u201d to replace articles and web pages \u2014 didn\u2019t quite come to pass, as search results were superseded by fast-moving social feeds for news and entertainment. Google now has plenty of competition as a major online media distributor. The \u201catomic unit\u201d she described remains just that.Ms. Mayer\u2019s media investments at Yahoo gave it some unique advantages compared with most media companies. Yahoo was, when Ms. Mayer took over, a marginal but large search engine itself, and its home page, driven by millions of email users, was able to direct viewers to articles, videos and other properties in the Yahoo ecosystem. It had invested heavily in advertising technology, developing into something between a platform and a home page. That it might have an edge over other websites, at least in its ability to make money from online media, holding its \u201catomic units\u201d together in some sort of coherent and therefore more lucrative whole, was still plausible.Nonetheless, according to Yahoo\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s public statements about the value of the acquisition, Yahoo\u2019s media operations were a crucial motivator for Verizon, which acquired AOL, a similarly threatened content and ad-tech empire, last year.In other words, Verizon, like Yahoo before it, thinks it can regain some control over media distribution. The logic is appealing but the path is unclear.It\u2019s true that as a mobile carrier and internet service provider, Verizon has its own advantages. As a wireless carrier, it knows a lot about where its users are, and what they do on their phones. As a smartphone vendor, it can assert itself over handset manufacturers, to some degree, to include extra apps and software on mobile phones.But how, exactly, Verizon plans to turn such abilities into lasting advantages, especially against the powerful and unified distribution systems of social platforms, is not clear. \u201cImagine the distribution challenges we will solve,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in her note, without elaboration.Again, the problem has been identified, but the solution remains to be seen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion\u2019s Newest Frontier: The Disabled and the Displaced", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedSix years ago, Maura Horton, a housewife in Raleigh, N.C., received a call from her husband, Don, the assistant football coach at North Carolina State. He was on the road for a game and having so much trouble buttoning his shirt, he had to ask a player (Russell Wilson, now the quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks) for help.Mr. Horton had received a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease four years before, and symptoms were starting to worsen.So Mrs. Horton did what anyone would do these days when faced with such a problem: She searched Google for \u201ceasy-to-close shirt.\u201d And found \u2026 not much.\u201cAnd then I looked at my iPad cover and saw it had these really small magnets, and thought, \u2018Well, what about that?\u2019\u201d she says now \u2014 a patent, a company and 22 shirt styles later.And healthwear is simply one part of a larger movement, in which classically trained designers (and those they work with) are rethinking the basic premise, and promise, of fashion itself. Call it solution-based design.Though fashion is often dismissed as frivolous and self-indulgent, this growing niche suggests that rather than being part of the problem \u2014 and a symbol of the multiple divisions in society (political, personal, economic) \u2014 it can actually come up with some of the answers.And she followed Lucy Jones, who won designer of the year in 2015 for a collection that focused on minimal, elegant clothes for wheelchair users, taking into account both the altered proportions necessitated by being permanently seated, and the challenges of getting pieces on and off when one is physically impaired \u2014 or taking care of someone who is.\u201cIt started when a professor of mine challenged us to do something that would change the world,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cI thought: \u2018How can I do that? This is fashion.\u2019\u201dBut then she began talking to a 14-year-old cousin who has a condition called hemiplegia, which means that one side of his body is significantly weaker than the other. He told her he was being teased at school for not being able to do up his pants by himself, and how embarrassed he was. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe no one had tried to fix that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then I realized it was a much bigger problem.\u201dShe met with United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and started conducting focus groups. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething everyone does \u2014 get dressed and undressed \u2014 should not be a challenge.\u201dMr. Razdan had a similar epiphany in 2014, while he was working at an internet start-up following a stint at Goldman Sachs. He noticed that some family members who were wrestling with cancer were walking around with what looked like the ankle section of tube socks on their upper arms.The socks, it turned out, were being used as not particularly attractive covers for peripherally inserted central catheters, semi-permanent intravenous lines in the upper arm. Known as PICC lines, they allow easy vein access for chemotherapy and extended antibiotic administration, among other uses.After his mother, an anesthesiologist, mentioned to a former colleague at Johns Hopkins that her son had an idea to improve the cover, Mr. Razdan teamed up with a friend\u2019s wife who had been working at Kensie, a contemporary brand for girls.Together they created what is effectively a brightly colored sleeve, not unlike a truncated version of what runners and basketball players now use, except that it is made with an antimicrobial treatment and comes with a mesh window to make dressings visible and let them breathe. It can be customized in a variety of ways, and makes the wearer look like LeBron James (kind of) instead of a patient.This was followed by shirts \u2014 polo, baseball and a zippered blouse \u2014 that allow for the insertion and removal of central lines and ports, as well as a collaboration with Ms. Jones on gloves made specifically for wheelchair users. (Generally, wheelchair users adapt bicycle or batting gloves for their purposes.)\u201cWhat you wear has a profound impact on your psyche,\u201d Mr. Razdan said. \u201cIt can make you feel like yourself again at a time when it\u2019s easy to feel like things are out of your control.\u201dThough most of the people involved in solution-based design have a missionary zeal when they talk about what they do \u2014 not just what it means for the people they reach, but also what it means for their industry and its image in society \u2014 it has not escaped any of them that it is also a significant business opportunity.\u201cWe think it is a $40 billion industry,\u201d said Mr. Razdan, who is in talks with a \u201cbig-name designer \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you who\u201d to redesign a hospital gown. More than 580 million people are admitted to hospitals worldwide every year, according to the World Medical Markets Factbook.It all seems so obvious that it\u2019s hard not to wonder: What took fashion so long?Fashion, which was once a world defined by exclusivity \u2014 clothes for the very rich, or the very skinny; clothes for insiders, for people who knew where to shop \u2014 has, in recent years, undergone a democratic revolution.If the doors first opened with Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s popularization of high-fashion ready-to-wear in the 1960s, they were thrown wide to the masses at the turn of the millennium with the advent of fast fashion, and the idea that economics should not dictate who has access to cool clothes.From there, it did not take long for the same idea to be applied to size, age, sexuality and religion. Yet solving for the disabled and the displaced has in many ways been the final frontier.Though advances in medical technology and legislation have created situations in which people with long-term conditions are increasingly able to be part of the work force and quotidian life, the implications \u2014 they need clothes that allow them to do so while also accommodating their physical reality \u2014 have taken a while to sink in.Manufacturing has similarly not caught up with reality, and Ms. Jones and Ms. Luna cite issues with nonstandard pattern-cutting and materials (people in wheelchairs, for example, need tops with very truncated bodies but long arms) as roadblocks to wider production.But beyond the practical, there\u2019s also a more fundamental issue of what, exactly, fashion is for.When Ms. Luna first became immersed in the refugee crisis, she considered transferring from Parsons to a school with a more traditional international relations program (she even applied to Sciences Po \u2014 the Paris Institute of Political Studies) because she couldn\u2019t imagine how what she was learning could be relevant. She didn\u2019t have a model to follow.And when she realized that her skills may have a practical application, she had to overcome the stigma of refugee chic, the assumption that she was being \u201cinspired\u201d by the crisis to make expensive clothes. (You can understand why: Last year, a Hungarian photographer did a widely criticized fashion shoot featuring a model in runway attire posing by a barbed wire fence.)But this is not about exploiting an issue, or even bringing it to broader attention. It\u2019s about seeing fashion as a tool to ameliorate it and creating a system to help.\u201cFashion has created a lot of problems, but there is an opportunity for it to be a force for good,\u201d Ms. Luna said. \u201cWe just have to realize it.\u201dSo at Parsons, a new discipline called \u201csystems and society\u201d has been developed for Bachelor of Fine Arts students. It focuses on how to \u201cutilize their education and learned skills within a broader context,\u201d according to Burak Cakmak, dean of the fashion school at Parsons.\u201cThis gives the young designers an opportunity to operate and succeed in areas that are traditionally outside the fashion industry, but also help define the future of fashion businesses by expanding its scope,\u201d he said.\u201cIn today\u2019s world, we are all asking ourselves how we can play a role in bringing change to problems around us as an individual,\u201d Mr. Cakmak said. Designers are no longer exempt from that question.An earlier version of this article identified incorrectly Chaitenya Razdan\u2019s design collaborator at Care and Wear. She worked at Kensie, but was not a designer there.A picture caption on July 21 with an article about designers whose clothing addresses social problems misspelled the given name of one of the designers. She is Angela Luna, not Anglea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Leaves Shareholders With Little Say", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorYahoo\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon is a complicated beast, showing how different acquisition structures can affect how shareholders are treated.First, let\u2019s say what the Yahoo sale is not. It is not a sale of the publicly traded company. Instead, it is a sale of the Yahoo subsidiary and some related assets to Verizon.Because it is a sale of a subsidiary, the $4.8 billion will be paid to Yahoo. Its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend (after paying taxes). Instead, Yahoo shareholders will be left holding shares in the renamed company.As for Remain Co., it will become a so-called investment company. This is a special designation for a company that holds securities for investment but does not operate a working business. Investment companies are subject to special regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Remain Co. will probably just sit there, returning cash to shareholders and waiting for Alibaba to buy it in a tax-free transaction. (Alibaba says it has no plans to do this, but most people do not believe this).The rights of Yahoo shareholders in this sale will be different from those in an ordinary sale, when an entire company is bought.In either case, shareholders get a say. They either vote on the merger or decide whether to tender into the offer.The Yahoo deal, however, is not a sale of the public company. It is an asset sale, in which there is only a shareholder vote if there is a sale of \u201call\u201d or \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the assets of the company. Yahoo is not all of the assets or even \u201csubstantially all\u201d \u2013 the Alibaba shares being left behind in Remain Co. are worth about $28 billion, or six times the value of the cash Verizon is paying for the Yahoo assets it is buying.There will be no appraisal rights, however. Again, in an asset sale, there are no appraisal rights. So anyone who votes against the deal and thinks this is a bum price is out of luck.The different standards for voting and appraisal rights apply because the structure of the deal is a quirk of the law in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, that allows lawyers to sometimes work around these issues simply by changing the way a deal is done.In Yahoo\u2019s case, this is not deliberate, though. It is simply the most expedient way to get rid of the assets.Finally, if another bidder still wants to acquire Yahoo, it has time. The agreement with Verizon allows Yahoo to terminate the deal and accept a superior offer by paying a $144 million breakup fee to Verizon. And if Yahoo shareholders change their minds and want to stick with Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, and vote down the deal, there is a so-called naked no-vote termination fee of $15 million payable to Verizon to reimburse expenses.All in all, this was as hairy a deal as they come. There was the procedural and logistical complications of selling a company when the chief executive wanted to stay. Then there was the fact that this was an asset sale, including all of the challenges that go with it. Throw in all of the tax issues and the fact that this is a public company, and it is likely that the lawyers involved will have nightmares for years to come.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Abbas Kiarostami Had Me Thinking in Persian", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byAn AppraisalThe plan was that Mr. Kiarostami and I would converse with the aid of his translator, since the filmmaker\u2019s English was apparently only a little better than my Farsi. The unforeseen wrinkle was that the translator spoke only Farsi and Spanish, the first language of most of my students and, of course, the idiom of the country where we all happened to be.But we could hardly just stand around smiling and nodding. A game of multilingual telephone ensued. I would hand off an English question to one of the translators, who passed along a Spanish version that would reach Mr. Kiarostami in his native language, at which point the process reversed. The remarkable thing is not that we managed to keep this clumsy human version of Google Translate going for much longer than the allotted hour, as we ate pistachios and sipped limeade in a humid courtyard, but that after a while it seemed like an utterly natural form of communication.Viewers of foreign-language films sometimes forget that they are reading subtitles instead of understanding what the actors are saying. Something similar happened that evening, a hallucinatory melting of linguistic barriers. I remembered a few phrases of long-ago college Spanish, and so could now and then skip a step in the translators\u2019 bucket brigade. Mr. Kiarostami\u2019s translator was as quick and nimble as an Olympic athlete, and Mr. Kiarostami himself was as patient as a teacher in a roomful of earnest slow learners. But afterward many of us agreed that we had experienced something much stranger and more profound than a successful search for verbal equivalents. We swore that for a short but intense period, under the spell of the filmmaker\u2019s quiet charisma, we had all been thinking in Persian.But perhaps we had just been thinking in Kiarostami, albeit without the aid of the usual apparatus of moving pictures and recorded sounds. A poet and photographer as well as filmmaker, Mr. Kiarostami was as steeped in Persian literary traditions as he was devoted to the transparency of the photographic image. Watching his films, you are sometimes aware that specific cultural and historical nuances may be eluding you. At the same time, what you see is always absolutely clear, even if its meanings are sometimes enigmatic.Mr. Kiarostami started out making educational films, often featuring children and ostensibly meant for young viewers, and even as his work grew more abstract in its methods and more adult in its themes, a vital element of plainness \u2014 a preference for showing and pointing out and paying attention over lecturing or narrating \u2014 remained.More recently, Iranian films have moved toward psychological drama and social criticism, neither of which figured among Mr. Kiarostami\u2019s major concerns. This is not to say that he was indifferent to the emotions of his characters or their circumstances, but rather that he viewed the world and its human inhabitants from a particular philosophical angle, a curiosity both about the texture of reality and about the camera\u2019s effect on it. His movies are at once highly self-conscious \u2014 the viewer is often intensely aware of the presence of the camera, and occasionally of the man behind it \u2014 and bluntly naturalistic.In Cartagena, Mr. Kiarostami invoked those frogs \u2014 for a minute I thought he was talking about the ducks that appear in another part of \u201cFive\u201d \u2014 as something of a metaphor, an example of the serendipitous irruption of reality into a carefully planned composition. Reality can intrude catastrophically, in the form of natural or political disasters. And the process is reversible: Film also changes reality, injecting new meanings and dimensions into its mute, mundane manifestations. It does this in small ways, as when a child looks directly into the camera or an actor decides to ignore its presence.In large ways, too. To an extent that we have only begun to grasp, movies invented a new way of thinking, and Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s movies are among the clearest and most challenging applications of cinematic thought. What happened in Cartagena that evening was what will always happen when someone watches a Kiarostami film with the right kind of attention, which is to say an openness to confusion and to the wonder of the ordinary. You don\u2019t speak his language, but you are somehow inside his head. And he is in yours.Advertisement"}

In a blog post late on Wednesday, the electric carmaker\u2019s boss laid out his vision for the next decade or so. He has some compelling ideas: building more vehicle types and increasing autonomous-driving capabilities for a sharing economy. The trouble is that plenty of rivals want a piece of that business, too. And his missive fails to address several more immediate concerns \u2013 not least how to finance his ambitions.Mr. Musk titled his post \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux,\u201d \u2013 a reference to the \u201cSecret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\u201d that he wrote almost 10 years ago to the day. That detailed how he was building an electric sports car to raise money to manufacture family-friendly vehicles. He has largely succeeded, which lessens the conceit of drafting a new outline for the next decade.Unlike in 2006, though, Mr. Musk\u2019s ideas are now mainstream. Larger carmakers have caught on to the appeal of both electric and self-driving vehicles \u2013 as have the likes of Google and Apple. Everyone is grappling with the concept of people sharing private vehicles or using a taxilike fleet.Tesla may have an advantage in some areas. It is, after all, solely committed to electric and autonomous cars while traditional players still concentrate on gasoline engines. But Daimler, Ford, Toyota and others have deep pockets, whereas Tesla is still losing money and has to raise capital just to make sure it has the cash to develop its more affordable Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk\u2019s vision also includes electric passenger buses and heavy-duty trucks. Those are not just expensive propositions; they\u2019re also technologically tough at present as batteries powerful enough to propel them are not yet commercially viable.In the more immediate future, shareholders have another concern: Mr. Musk\u2019s desire to combine Tesla with SolarCity, his home solar panel company. The plan does nothing to allay fears about the motives for the tie-up or the governance issues it raises.Mr. Musk\u2019s determination to think far ahead is a positive and infectious antidote to short-term financial markets. But it is also a stark reminder that shareholders are not even riding shotgun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bull Market Blues", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe answer, I\u2019d suggest, isn\u2019t entirely positive. In fact, in some ways the stock market\u2019s gains reflect economic weaknesses, not strengths. And understanding how that works may help us make sense of the troubling state our economy is in.The truth, in any case, is that there are three big points of slippage between stock prices and the success of the economy in general. First, stock prices reflect profits, not overall incomes. Second, they also reflect the availability of other investment opportunities \u2014 or the lack thereof. Finally, the relationship between stock prices and real investment that expands the economy\u2019s capacity has gotten very tenuous.On the first point: We measure the economy\u2019s success by the extent to which it generates rising incomes for the population. But stocks don\u2019t reflect incomes in general; they only reflect the part of income that shows up as profits.On the second point: When investors buy stocks, they\u2019re buying a share of future profits. What that\u2019s worth to them depends on what other options they have for converting money today into income tomorrow. And these days those options are pretty poor, with interest rates on long-term government bonds not only very low by historical standards but zero or negative once you adjust for inflation. So investors are willing to pay a lot for future income, hence high stock prices for any given level of profits.This may seem, however, to present a paradox. If the private sector doesn\u2019t see itself as having a lot of good investment opportunities, how can profits be so high? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that these days profits often seem to bear little relationship to investment in new capacity. Instead, profits come from some kind of market power \u2014 brand position, the advantages of an established network, or good old-fashioned monopoly. And companies making profits from such power can simultaneously have high stock prices and little reason to spend.In other words, while record stock prices do put the lie to claims that the Obama administration has been anti-business, they\u2019re not evidence of a healthy economy. If anything, they\u2019re a sign of an economy with too few opportunities for productive investment and too much monopoly power.So when you read headlines about stock prices, remember: What\u2019s good for the Dow isn\u2019t necessarily good for America, or vice versa.Advertisement"}

But the Dollar Shave acquisition signals something bigger than a mere improvement in shaving \u2014 it also underscores a consumer products revolution that would not have been possible without technology.For you and me, this is a boon. By cutting out the inefficiencies of retail space and the marketing expense of TV, the new companies can offer better products at lower prices. We will get a wider range of products \u2014 if companies don\u2019t have to market a single brand to everyone on TV, they can create a variety of items aimed at blocs of consumers who were previously left behind. And because these companies were born online, where reputations live and die on word of mouth, they are likely to offer friendlier, more responsive customer service than their faceless offline counterparts.With Casper, you simply buy the mattress online and it\u2019s shipped to you in a comically small box (the compressed foam expands into a full-sized mattress, like a magic trick). You have three months to try it out, and if you don\u2019t like it, the company will come pick it up free.Casper\u2019s business model offers a break from the annoyance of offline mattress shopping. It also works out for the company. Casper advertises on social networks, on Google, podcasts and a variety of other places online; the ads are creative, convincing, targeted and cheap. By selling directly rather than through retail middlemen, the company also creates a connection with customers that allows it to test and develop new products \u2014 it now sells sheets and pillows, too.Value destruction could be on the table. But there\u2019s another view that new online brands could unlock profits through products aimed at people who are not well served by incumbents.Unlike Dollar Shave, Mr. Walker does not aim to compete with traditional consumer product companies on price alone. \u201cWe want to build a very profitable business,\u201d he said. He will do so, he said, by fostering a deep, lifelong connection with an audience that is getting wealthier and more influential \u2014 and whose influence, thanks to social networks, can now be tapped.\u201cGlobal culture is led by American culture, which is led by black culture in the U.S. \u2014 look at music, dance, et cetera,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re catering to an audience that are the most culturally influential demographic group in the world, we can use the internet to promulgate our message across the board, whether it\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram \u2014 and that gives us amazing leverage.\u201dWalker & Company declined to provide sales numbers; a spokesman said revenue had grown 300 percent over the last year.\u201cWe\u2019re offering a solution to busy parents that\u2019s just not out there in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Carbonell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about some new style every day, it\u2019s something you can count on.\u201dIt\u2019s striking how few of these online companies could have taken off in the presocial age. At the very least, they would have been sunk by the inability to target ads to the demographics they\u2019re aiming to serve.\u201cLook at Dollar Shave,\u201d Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads and business platform, told me. \u201cThey were just trying to reach men.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.A big part of what has made Amazon\u2019s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon\u2019s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers \u2014 the warehouses from which it processes customer orders \u2014 in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year.Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon.\u201cI would not take our financial results as an indication we\u2019re running out of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to really prove out their profitability,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Amazon\u2019s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results.The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business.The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing.Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google.Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company\u2019s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.The company\u2019s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\u201cThey are defying the laws of gravity,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt shows their level of market share gains is increasing.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings misstated the number of consecutive quarters in which Amazon has shown a record profit. It is three, not two.Advertisement"}

These are edited excerpts from that conversation.How were you invited to participate in the convention?Jane Sanders emailed me directly, and also the D.N.C. reached out to my publicist. I thought: Yeah. One thing they don\u2019t do right at these conventions is their language isn\u2019t accessible to everybody. Most people who vote don\u2019t know what Citizens United means, or what \u201coligarchy\u201d means. It\u2019s important to talk in plain English. Part of Trump\u2019s success is he talks in simple language and he just says things like, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be great\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re going to be great\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be great.\u201d That\u2019s what a lot of politicians do. They speak in vague terms so that they can get the mass appeal.Did you see your speech as an attempt to soothe supporters of Mr. Sanders, who might still have raw feelings from the primaries?There\u2019s a lot of heartbreak in it. But the truth of the matter is, it\u2019s so simple. Look, Bernie ran as a Democrat, so as to not split the vote. I voted for Ralph Nader when Gore quote-unquote lost to Bush. He didn\u2019t want to do that. The Bernie or Bust people, the people who are like, Bernie or nothing, I don\u2019t know what their long-term plan is or what their perfect scenario could possibly be. I couldn\u2019t love Bernie more, and to help him at this point is to make sure he has an ally in office. People who change the world aren\u2019t always the president. I don\u2019t think he needs to be president, and I can\u2019t wait to see what Obama does out of office. This movement has never been something that he planned on ending with the election. And I\u2019m absolutely voting for Hillary. You\u2019d be crazy not to.Knowing how much booing and raucousness there had been in those first hours of the convention, how did you feel about having to go out and face that crowd?I focused on the audience at home, which is usually not what I like to do. But the loudest voice doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right voice or the majority voice at all. It was almost like the Red Sox and the Yankees \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a common sense to it. I understand the passion behind Bernie. No one\u2019s more passionate than me. I just don\u2019t see it as a defeat that he doesn\u2019t get to be president. He\u2019s so effective anyway.And in the moment that you addressed the Bernie or Bust people \u2014\u2014I wasn\u2019t going to say the \u201cridiculous\u201d thing. They told us to stretch, and I just saw these people going: \u201cBoo! Bernie!\u201d Whatever.When you\u2019re a comic, and you do material that you mean in one way, and people take it in another \u2014 like years ago, I would do a lot of racial stuff, and I meant it in a very bleeding-heart liberal way, ultimately. By being the idiot.There were people who would take that literally, and we would call those mouth-full-of-blood laughs. They\u2019re the laughs you don\u2019t want. And those people cheering for Bernie when he came out \u2014 the whole place was so inspired; the whole room was amazing. But that little section of quote-unquote Bernie Bros or whatever, it\u2019s the fans you don\u2019t want. The fundamentalists of any group, including fans of Bernie or fans of Hillary or fans of anyone are a bummer. So that\u2019s just a given. It\u2019s not that big a deal.Did you feel as if you were addressing them as a comedian would knock down a heckler?No, no \u2014 it didn\u2019t feel like heckles. It was such chaos. You can\u2019t hear, really, anything that\u2019s going on at all. It just is a really loud white noise. It\u2019s too much to take in or hear any individual voices. It wasn\u2019t a heckler return. It was something that\u2019s been burbling in me.Was there anything you wanted to do in your speech that the Democratic National Committee wouldn\u2019t allow?At the very beginning, when Al said, \u201cI\u2019m Al Franken, and this past year I\u2019ve been hashtag-I\u2019m With Her,\u201d and I was going to say, \u201cAnd I\u2019m Sarah Silverman, and this past year I\u2019ve been with the possibly agnostic Jew.\u201d Because you know the Right is going to use these emails to try to separate them. It\u2019s what they want so badly. I just felt like, let the comedian defuse it and just address the elephant in the room. But they were like, no. And they are right. They\u2019re right. But I get so indignant. At least I\u2019m aware, and awareness brings change, so maybe I\u2019ll be less obnoxious.What kind of feedback did you get in the immediate aftermath, coming off the stage?I have not been on Twitter or social media yet. I will absolutely Google myself. I\u2019ve been nonstop, and I\u2019m sick and I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m visiting my parents. So mostly, I\u2019ve had a ton of feedback from my friends and family, from emails and texts. It\u2019s been very positive, but they\u2019re all people who love me, so I don\u2019t know. The people from the D.N.C. were very happy.If people who still support Mr. Sanders say that they feel you\u2019ve sold them out somehow, how would you feel?That\u2019s their opinion. I learned the hard way, through comedy, to defend what you\u2019re putting out there is silly. Once you put it out there, it\u2019s for other people to experience, and you can\u2019t control it. I thought a lot about it, and it seems so clear to me that it\u2019s the right thing to do. If they love Bernie so much, why are they disregarding his wishes? He clearly is backing Hillary. Any backlash that I\u2019m a sellout, that\u2019s theirs to have and hold. It has nothing to do with me. If you don\u2019t get Zen about it, you could really go crazy. My mom would always watch MSNBC and get so riled up. I would always tell her, \u201cMom, sometimes you have to change the channel. Watch a \u2018Bones\u2019 or a \u2018Law & Order\u2019 or something.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "San Francisco is famous for its natural beauty, hippie legacy and traditionally open-minded culture. At the moment, however, the city is making headlines for its boom-town growth, as Silicon Valley employees working for megacompanies like Apple, Facebook and Google have migrated north and displaced longtime residents. As income inequality again becomes a powerful talking point in America, and countless homeless people roam the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s streets, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to wonder: Is ultraliberal San Francisco losing its soul?The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural institutions, such a large part of what makes San Francisco special, are the obvious beneficiaries of the influx of new wealth. That includes the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which recently reopened after a three-year, $305 million renovation. In honor of the occasion (and to mark the official retirement of the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime lead photography curator, Sandra Phillips), the museum is presenting \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia and the West,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a massive survey looking at the state of the region, featuring work from 19th-century masters like Carleton Watkins, the 20th-century icons Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, and right up to the present day.According to Ms. Phillips, rather than mounting a tightly themed show, she and her colleagues chose to use the excitement surrounding the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reopening to help expand the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permanent collection, an important part of every curator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission. She said they wanted to see \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat they could celebrate\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they reached out to the community of collectors. As a result, the exhibition features only new and promised gifts to the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection; more greatest hits than concept album. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seemed to me that we had already developed a pretty good collection of California photography, but it needed a certain added dimension,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt needed to be larger, more meaningful, and it needed to address things we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, in various ways, consciously addressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe show is installed in the Pritzker Center for Photography, and is slightly overwhelming in person, as the space is enormous. As a viewer, it can be hard to focus when there are so many excellent photographs on display, but several favorites did emerge.An Edward Weston picture of a whale vertebra was most likely made for its beautiful, formal qualities, but in the context of our environmentally focused times, it reads as a sad symbol of the plight of endangered species. A little-known Minor White photo made at the Daly City dump, of rubber tires on fire, also takes on added significance, as one imagines all that toxic smoke wafting skyward.Trevor Paglen, the contemporary photographic artist who recently won the 2016 Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse Prize, presents a brilliant albumen print of a military drone streaking across the sky, single-handedly linking the 19th century to the 21st.Befitting an institution in a city that supports its own, several key San Francisco photographers, including Jim Goldberg and Michael Jang,  get pride of place, too.Mr. Goldberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seminal series \u00e2\u0080\u009cRich and Poor\u00e2\u0080\u009d takes up an entire hallway, forcing viewers through a gantlet of wealth disparity that seems incredibly relevant today. The pictures, made in the early 1980s, contrast low-income residents of the Mission District with well-heeled residents of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tonier neighborhoods. (The subjects also wrote directly onto the prints.)Mr. Goldberg was open about the importance of showing such work to the public in 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIncome inequality is much deeper and more prominent, I think, in the American consciousness than it was in the late \u00e2\u0080\u009970s or early \u00e2\u0080\u009980s, when I was doing this work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would agree that these rents are crazy, and the evictions are horrible. So amid the rise of this kind of new and tech-propelled gilded class, I think my portraits of the haves can seem like artifacts from a much distant, much less corrosive version of wealth.\u00e2\u0080\u009dConversely, he was loath to criticize the new culture that has arisen, stressing that change is a constant in urban environments. He also spoke about how the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art had grown in parallel with the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise, and how it had so strenuously supported his career.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I moved here, the museum was in Herbst Theater, across from City Hall. They had the third and fourth floor. It was very small, very intimate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou literally could knock on the photography curator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door and say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hi, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Jim Goldberg. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d really like to show you my work.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And you could. I did. It was incredible.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMichael Jang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mural-size photograph of the raucous party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge was given the exhibition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frontispiece. He also owes his current career success to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, although he took a far more circuitous route than did Mr. Goldberg.Mr. Jang studied at Cal Arts in the \u00e2\u0080\u009970s and made a string of projects that are just now gaining attention, as he never pursued an art career  but chose instead to use photography to support his family.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI realized that I had to make a living if I wanted to do standard things of family, get a house and cars and all that stuff. Raise children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used the camera as a way to make money. From weddings to editorial, and later a bit of advertising and the commercial world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTen years ago, his work was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscovered\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the museum\u2019s curatorial team when, on a whim, he dropped off his portfolio, a courtesy offered to local artists.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA week or two later,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got a call saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can you come in? The curators would like to talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 At the meeting, they said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wow. What is this? Do you have more?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Heck yeah! Decades worth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a metaphor for one of life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simplest lessons: You have to take the good with the bad. That seems to be Ms. Phillips\u2019s opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely exciting, and a time for us to try and figure out a way forward, without destroying the original fabric of the city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has certainly been movement of young people out of San Francisco to Oakland, and other parts of the Bay Area, and to Southern California. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely true. I would say the art world is changing. The artists are changing. And of course there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern about that.

Although they sound like the homes of science fiction, they might well be the real residences of the not-too-distant future.\u201cWe have built with the design principle that sea level is not going to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time has come to an end. On the other hand, living in the coastal zone is extremely important for us. So we need to find a way to live in the coastal zone, but we cannot assume that sea level is stable.\u201d\u201cNobody has solved the issue,\u201d Ms. Frewen said.The method supplies a concrete mixture through a robotic gantry guided by a computer. Instead of a hand laying a line of bricks, the machine\u2019s nozzle pours a shaped tube of concrete, following the entire outline of the house in one lap. The next go-round adds another layer, building until it is time for the roof to be added by a crane, then perhaps another story on top. For apartment buildings, Mr. Khoshnevis has plans for a machine that will climb the building as it builds it.He aims to build a full house in one day without a human hand, a goal he says will happen within the next year or two. Though Mr. Khoshnevis started the 3-D printing construction movement in 1996, the Chinese company Winsun has already printed homes and apartments using a similar method, though creating the pieces off-site and assembling them at the location of the structure. Mr. Khoshnevis says American building codes have created a longer timeline for 3-D-printed houses to ensure their safety.For cities in the far future, Mr. Khoshnevis and NASA are working together to build structures using Contour Crafting on the moon from materials available there. If your great-great-great-grandchildren end up living on Mars, it might be one of these machines that builds their houses.Mr. Khoshnevis has some high-powered fellow believers. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, recently listed 3-D-printed construction on a list of the \u201cnext really interesting moon shots,\u201d referring to ideas that will radically shape the future. \u201cWe can build them with 100 percent recyclable materials,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cSo it\u2019s another good reason from an environmental perspective.\u201dThese innovations will create much more originality in housing, Mr. Mamou-Mani said, because the selection of files will be so vast and the design can be changed between buildings with little effort, so the economies of mass production will no longer benefit repetition of design.\u201cIt will empower people to participate in the designs they want instead of being relatively passive in the way they inhabit, choose a home or buy a product,\u201d he said.The kinds of files people will have access to will open up areas usually not thought of as part of home building. For example, while some people have talked about how drones could pick up and move houses in the future, Mr. Mamou-Mani said, \u201cThe house will be the drone. Why separate the thing that carries you from the house? Just make it the house.\u201cOur generation is increasingly nomad, raised with low-cost airlines and often working from home with laptops, therefore flying our homes will seem normal in the future, and as for any migrating bird, borders between countries will seem like an absurd relic of the past.\u201dKasita, a company in Austin, Tex., is moving toward a model that would allow people to move a home between cities without wheels or propellers.Imagine owning a micro-movable apartment that you parked in a building in Austin, where it slides in like a drawer. When you needed to move to Los Angeles, a crane would come, put your house on a truck that would drive it to your new location, where a forklift could slide it into an opening in your new building.This is the idea behind a design created by Jeff Wilson, chief executive of Kasita, who became known as Professor Dumpster after living in a 33-square-foot Dumpster for a year as a way to test the limits of minimalism. Thinking of a way to help musicians, artists, young people and service workers being priced out of booming Austin, he came up with a 320-square-foot smart home that can stand alone or be inserted into a rack up to 10 stories tall. In the rack units, the houses will plug in to water, power and sewer lines. The company is hoping to produce its first 40 units this year.\u201cShort term, we\u2019re thinking about our mission of providing an affordable urban solution. Long term, we\u2019re just going to have to become more nimble in how we continue to live in our cities,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cIf the sea levels rise, it\u2019s certainly going to be a lot easier to move a Kasita than it will be to move a Hilton.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 3", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementPHILADELPHIA \u2014 A country off the rails or one that makes steady if imperfect progress?A land of disenchantment or of stubborn, spectacular promise?The intensifying battle between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is turning into a contest of those visions. That became clearer than ever on the third night of the Democratic National Convention here, as President Obama answered Trump\u2019s message of fear with a proclamation of hope as rousing and robust as any I\u2019ve heard.\u201cAmerica is already great,\u201d Obama said \u2014 thundered, really. \u201cAmerica is already strong. And I promise you our strength \u2014 our greatness \u2014 does not depend on Donald Trump. In fact it doesn\u2019t depend on any one person.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk in this campaign about what America has lost,\u201d he added, then flashed back to his Kansas grandparents \u2014 whom he\u2019d mentioned in the 2004 convention speech that introduced him to most Americans \u2014 and to the virtues of \u201ckindness, courtesy, humility, responsibility\u201d that they preached.\u201cAmerica has changed over the years, but these values that my grandparents taught \u2014 they haven\u2019t gone anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re as strong as ever, still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith. They live on in each of us.\u201dAnd with Trump very much in mind, he made clear: \u201cWe don\u2019t fear the future. We shape it. We embrace it.\u201dIt\u2019s hard, frankly, to stop quoting from his remarks because they amounted to one of the most moving, inspiring valentines to this country that I\u2019ve ever heard, brimming with regard for it and gratitude to it.We\u2019re going to miss this man, America. Whatever his flaws, he\u2019s been more than our president. Time and again, he\u2019s been our national poet.His speech reflected a fascinating role reversal this election cycle, with the Republicans \u2014 or, at least, the Republican presidential nominee \u2014 speaking in stormy terms about America\u2019s failures while the Democrats stress how much sunshine there really is.At least since Ronald Reagan\u2019s declaration of \u201cmorning again in America,\u201d the G.O.P. has tended toward optimism and uplift, but Trump has little interest in cheerleading. So Democrats have grabbed the pom-poms.Obama even went so far as to claim Reagan\u2019s perspective as the current Democratic one \u2014 and to use it to shame Trump.\u201cRonald Reagan called America a shining city on a hill,\u201d the president said. \u201cDonald Trump calls it a divided crime scene that only he can fix.\u201dEarlier in the night, Vice President Joe Biden concluded his rawly, infectiously emotional speech by shouting: \u201cWe are America, second to none, and we own the finish line! Don\u2019t forget it! Come on! We\u2019re America!\u201dBut they paid tribute to the might of the United States military, which Trump has repeatedly questioned, in a rah-rah manner typically associated with Republicans.And Obama and Biden both answered Trump\u2019s lament about America\u2019s supposedly lost greatness with assertions of its continued potency.\u201cWe have the finest fighting force in the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world. We have the most productive workers in the world.\u201dObama focused on our armed forces, too, saying: \u201cDonald Trump calls our military a disaster. Apparently he doesn\u2019t know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known.\u201dThat was striking, and so were some of the characterizations of Trump.They portrayed him as danger incarnate \u2014 not just unprincipled and uninformed but possibly unhinged. Over the past decades, I\u2019ve never heard a major political party\u2019s nominee discussed so cataclysmically.\u201cRisky, reckless and radical\u201d is what Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, labeled him.\u201cLet\u2019s elect a sane, competent person,\u201d Bloomberg said, implying that Trump was insane.For Obama, defeating Trump is personal.A Trump victory would not only unravel some of his proudest accomplishments but also contradict the story that he\u2019s been telling about America, one of widening hearts and expanding social justice.One of the longstanding complaints about Obama is that he has not summoned the energy and selflessness to improve the fortunes of the Democratic Party beyond him. Since his 2008 election, the party has lost ground in the House, in the Senate and in statehouses across the country. The Democratic advantage in presidential elections is not matched by Democratic dominance beyond the White House.There\u2019d be a heaping measure of forgiveness for that if Democrats won the presidency for a third straight term. And it wouldn\u2019t be just any third term. The nation\u2019s first black president would be handing over the reins to the nation\u2019s first woman president, a sequence of milestones in perfect keeping with the Democratic Party\u2019s celebration of a more diverse, inclusive America.But the case he was really making was for America.Recalling that first convention speech of his in 2004, he said, \u201cI was filled with faith: faith in America, the generous, big-hearted, hopeful country that made my story \u2014 that made all of our stories \u2014 possible.\u201d\u201cThe America I know,\u201d he said, \u201cis full of courage and optimism and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous.\u201dThat tack is in some ways inevitable and necessary: It complements the Democrats\u2019 argument that Obama has moved the country forward, improving Americans\u2019 lives, and that keeping the White House under Democratic control, with his handpicked successor, is crucial.But the way he delivered it, it didn\u2019t seem to be a cold-eyed strategy or a self-serving bid for validation. It came across as a cry from the heart \u2014 and an earnest, gorgeous one at that.Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Michael Bloomberg clearly believes that Donald Trump is giving New York billionaires a bad name. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s running his business. God help us!\u201d he snarled at the Democratic convention.Nothing crueler than a self-made mogul lacing into an \u2026 heir.\u201cI built a business,\u201d said the man who ranks No. 8 on the Forbes list of the richest people on the planet. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t start it with a million dollar check from my father.\u201d Ouch.Bloomberg began by cautioning Democrats that he was not a part of their group and that he was there only \u201cto explain why I believe it is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.\u201dWhich was really not much of a pill for the party to swallow. (What? No shout-out for the platform?)New York City\u2019s former mayor tends to follow his own star, which is sort of an inherent right when you\u2019re worth around $48 billion. In his speech, he divided his time between savaging Trump and pointing out that he was a registered Independent \u201cbecause I don\u2019t believe that either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership.\u201dAll that was music to the ears of independent voter-hungry Democrats. Although if you live in New York City, where almost all elections are effectively decided in Democrats-only primaries, it is also a demand for disenfranchisement.There was no such problem this time. The convention scrutinizers were presumably able to live with Bloomberg\u2019s suggestion that Democrats might be too tough on the private sector in return for having one of the wealthiest guys in the world announce that \u201cthe richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy.\u201d\nHow did President Obama do in his speech? I am on the floor of the Democratic convention to get instant reaction.\nYou\u2019d be wrong. Mr. Trump was on strikingly good behavior during his A.M.A., offering only token references to \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d lest Redditors doubt it was really him.To a libertarian debating whether to vote for a third-party candidate or Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee (Reddit username: the-realDonaldTrump) replied: \u201cAmericans in every party are tired of our rigged system and corrupt politicians, and want to reform our government so it no longer benefits the powerful at the expense of everyone else. They know I will fix it so it works for them and their families.\u201dTo a user who asked what role NASA should have \u201cin helping to Make America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cHonestly I think NASA is wonderful! America has always led the world in space exploration.\u201dThis is about as contentious as he got, in response to a question about why Mrs. Clinton doesn\u2019t do more news conferences: \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton will not do press conferences because she cannot explain her illegally deleted 33,000 emails, or her disaster in Libya, or her role pushing TPP (which she would 100 percent approve if she got the chance), or her support for a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees, etc.\u201dOf course, Mr. Trump speaks without a filter on national television, so maybe he felt no need to let loose on Reddit. Maybe his staff did the whole A.M.A. for him. Or maybe, after a long day of telling the Russians to hack American servers, the-realDonaldTrump was just a little tired.Trump has often talked about Russia in his wacky way, saying he would be able to tame the Russian bear because he\u2019s an expert at the art of the deal. Leon Aron, a Russia expert with the American Enterprise Institute, has a more realistic assessment. \u201cPutin will run circles around Trump,\u201d he said today.But the Trump-Putin story has become truly bizarre since WikiLeaks published thousands of emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee. They certainly appear to have been hacked by Russian code jockeys working for Putin.At a news conference today at one of Trump\u2019s golf courses in Florida (why does the self-avowed friend of the ordinary American keep having events at exclusive golf clubs?), the Republican nominee dug the Russia hole deeper.Trump told reporters that he didn\u2019t know who hacked the D.N.C. emails. But, referring to messages that were deleted from Clinton\u2019s private email server, he said: \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201dAs incredible as it was to hear a presidential candidate seemingly urging an unfriendly foreign power to break into the emails of a former secretary of state, Trump didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cI never met Putin, I don\u2019t know who Putin is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said one nice thing about me. He said I\u2019m a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.\u201dTrump also told reporters today that he had \u201czero\u201d financial connections to Russia. \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia.\u201dAras Agalarov, one of the oligarchs who made billions with the help of Putin\u2019s corrupt and autocratic government, said he had signed a deal to build a Trump Tower in Russia. So much for Trump\u2019s lack of connection to Russia.And that doesn\u2019t even account for the longstanding and lucrative business connections of his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, with Russian oligarchs and the Ukrainian autocrat Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin puppet before he was deposed.\u201cI thought he was saying we want the emails back,\u201d Carlson said.Julie Roginsky, a co-host of the program, tried to inject reality into the conversation. \u201cThat is not how anybody outside this table understands it,\u201d she said.David Gregory, a CNN political analyst, called Trump \u201ca child playing with matches.\u201d That was well put.Gregory also said he had \u201crun out of words to express my shock and how completely beyond the pale that Donald Trump is as a potential leader of the free world.\u201dMaybe Gregory has, but Trump had many more words to offer today to show how shockingly unfit he is to be president.At one point in the news conference, he said that if elected, he would consider recognizing as legitimate Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. The last time I checked, Crimea was part of a sovereign nation, Ukraine, before Putin seized it, and American presidents don\u2019t encourage Russian expansionism.How far we\u2019ve come from Ronald Reagan going to Berlin and demanding the Kremlin \u201ctear down this wall.\u201d\nThe comedian talked to The New York Times\u2019s Jim Rutenberg from inside the (mini) Oval Office.\nAlong with the thousands of delegates, protesters, journalists and onlookers that have descended on Philadelphia this week, a gaggle of celebrities have made appearances both inside and outside the convention hall. The Democrats, on the other hand, have already featured a slew of actresses, including America Ferrera, Meryl Streep in an American flag patterned dress, Elizabeth Banks, Eva Longoria and Lena Dunham. One small hiccup in the celebrity parade: having the actor Tony Goldwyn \u2014 who plays a president who cheats on his wife in the Oval Office \u2014 speak in the run-up to Bill Clinton\u2019s speech. Susan Sarandon may have been having literally the worst time, but everyone else is trying not to. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Republican convention last week included a number of gestures toward diversity.The lineup featured some speakers and performers of color, including Pastor Mark Burns and the 6-year-old singer Heavenly Joy Jerkins. In his invocation on the last night of the convention, the Rev. Steve Bailey called for an end to racial discrimination. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s not right that racism continues to wound and destroy the lives of many in this land,\u201d he said.Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona introduced his state as \u201cthe home state of Cesar Chavez, home state of many native tribes, home state of electing some of the first women leaders in this country.\u201dJim Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case that led to marriage equality for same-sex couples, spoke on behalf of Ohio: \u201cThis Ohio boy helped love win last summer. And this Ohio boy and my fellow Ohioans know this: Love trumps hate.\u201dStill, the Democratic convention so far has shown a commitment to real representation for female, minority and L.G.B.T. Americans \u2014 something the Republicans, with their talk of building a wall, banning Muslims and rolling back marriage equality, couldn\u2019t match.I don\u2019t expect him to acknowledge how the demands of party loyalty have erased any Catholic distinctiveness in his politics, any evidence that faith should trump partisanship when the two actively conflict.The erosion of Catholic distinctiveness is a long-running story in American politics. The church\u2019s social doctrine stresses both economic solidarity and social conservatism, calling Catholic politicians to either a pro-life, pro-family liberalism or to a one-nation conservatism, neither racist nor Ayn Randian.Tim Kaine was one of those candidates. Running for governor of Virginia in 2005, he offered a version of Mario Cuomo\u2019s \u201cpersonally opposed, but \u2026\u201d maneuver on abortion. But he also played up his support for a partial-birth abortion ban, parental notification laws and \u201cinformed consent\u201d provisions designed to persuade women to carry pregnancies to term.And then came Donald Trump, inviting Republicans to embrace a more authoritarian form of solidarity, unmoored from any real social conservatism and united by white-identity politics rather than a vision of the common good. Which to their credit, both Ryan and Rubio resisted \u2026 but only up to a point, because in the end partisanship trumped Catholic principle. (Mormon principle, it\u2019s worth noting, seems to be made of sterner stuff.)So this is the \u201cCatholic\u201d politics we have in the America of 2016: Catholic liberals who endorse unlimited abortion, and Catholic conservatives who endorse an authoritarian buffoon.Jesus wept.Ever since Americans elected their first African-American president, the not-so-hidden racism on the right has steadily slithered its way into the open \u2014 enabled most recently by Donald Trump\u2019s undisguised bigotry.O\u2019Reilly, who presents himself as a historian, pretended to be praising and expanding on the first lady\u2019s observation. \u201cThe history behind her remarks is fascinating,\u201d he said on his Fox News program.\u201cSlaves that worked there were well fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government, which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor.\u201dAnd so, O\u2019Reilly continued, \u201cMichelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House, but there were others working, as well.\u201dShe was not \u201cessentially\u201d right. She was completely right. I\u2019m sure the fact that non-slaves also worked on the White House would come as a great relief to the descendants of those unfortunate humans whose tormenters forced them to help build the official residence of the president of the United States.Let\u2019s be clear, the federal government never \u201chired\u201d slaves. It paid their enslaver for their work. And the fact that it did not forbid contractors from using slaves was a direct endorsement of slavery.Worst of all, O\u2019Reilly was mouthing classic racist propaganda when he waxed rhapsodic about the slaves having three hots and a cot.Pat Buchanan, another bigot, who once ran for president , wrote:And the list goes on. In his film \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America,\u201d the right winger Dinesh D\u2019Souza actually argues that while Frederick Douglass exposed the indescribable evil of slavery, he did, after all, stay in America.That\u2019s a particularly twisted version of the \u201cAmerica, love it or leave it\u201d argument of times past.It is especially sickening to see this kind of filth on an American news network, even one as slanted as Fox News \u2014 whose on-air ideologues claim to champion individual liberties \u2014 on the eve of President Obama\u2019s speech at the Philadelphia convention.The network, which recently ousted its creater, Roger Ailes, because of sexual harassment allegations, owes the country an apology.Slavery was a hideous crime committed against our fellow Americans. Black Americans were hunted, tortured, beaten and murdered by white Americans with impunity well into the second half of the 20th century.There is no excusing or explaining away slavery, just as there is no excusing O\u2019Reilly\u2019s remarks. At the very least, he personally owes us all an apology.PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Stephen Starr owned and operated a bunch of this city\u2019s most popular restaurants when the Republicans had their convention here in 2000. He owns and operates an even bigger bunch of those restaurants now.And over the years, plenty of prominent Republicans and Democrats have visited his upscale dining rooms, giving him a window into partisan grazing habits and a belief that they differ slightly, but only slightly, and in a way that\u2019s not exactly going to shock you.\u201cRepublicans don\u2019t eat much sushi,\u201d he told me. \u201cDefinitely, Democrats consume more sushi.\u201dIt was dinnertime on Tuesday, and the convention was nearing its midpoint. Starr seemed disappointed. Although he\u2019s both a Democrat and an admirer of Hillary Clinton\u2019s, he wasn\u2019t sensing as much excitement in the city as he did back in 2000, when the Republicans were nominating George W. Bush.But the difference, he said, wasn\u2019t about the candidates or even, really, the political parties. It was about the national mood.Before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and then the economic downturn of 2008, he said, there was a much bigger appetite for splashy events in stylish restaurants like his Asian-fusion fun house, Buddakan, and his Japanese fantasia, Morimoto.Now the events are more restrained. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for splashy to come back,\u201d Starr told me.It\u2019s Talula\u2019s Garden, his less showy, farm-to-table restaurant. In other words, the eat-your-peas political party is having dinner parties with vegetable-heavy menus.There\u2019s a missing spark, Starr said. At a party for the Funny or Die humor website and production company in his restaurant Buddakan on Monday night, there were two prominent Schumers on the guest list, he said: Chuck, the senator, and Amy, the TV and movie star.To the best of his knowledge, only Chuck made an appearance, Starr told me with something of a sigh.He perked up just minutes later, though, when he received word that at his restaurant Parc, a French brasserie next door to Barclay Prime, Elizabeth Warren and a few companions had just sat down. Their shared order included a green salad, clams on the half shell, escargots and halibut, I learned.Later the same night, Bernie Sanders dined in a party of 10 at Butcher and Singer, another of Starr\u2019s restaurants. He ate roast chicken, Starr informed me, and the side dishes on the table included creamed spinach, French fries and asparagus.Reflecting on the conventions that have come through Philadelphia, Starr said that the dining differences between political parties and between professional groups are relatively subtle, though he has noticed a lawyers-doctors divide.\u201cLawyers drink more and order more expensive items \u2014 for sure,\u201d he said.Back then, he said, a person or group would dine at the same place multiple times. He recalled that the former senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, ate dinner at the restaurant Vetri on three nights in four days. No one\u2019s doing that this time around, Benjamin said.He said that to get ready for this week, he reached out to Cleveland restaurateurs, who reported that many Republican delegates were leaving the convention hall during dinner hours to slip into restaurants for meals.Democratic delegates haven\u2019t been doing likewise, he said. They\u2019re staying put, keeping the arena\u2019s seats full.He didn\u2019t have any major sightings to report, but said he\u2019s been privately hoping to get sudden notice that President Obama was dropping by. He remains prepared. Although he has a limited daily supply of one of his signature entrees \u2014 lamb shoulder roasted with pomegranate juice \u2014 he has been keeping a half shoulder for four in reserve every night, just in case.\u201cWe have an Obama lamb,\u201d he told me. \u201cBarack Obama or Jesus Christ: We have lamb for those two.\u201d\nShare your thoughts as we draw a map of your opinions across America.\nThe children \u2014 Nicco, 12; Andreas, 9; and Simone, 6 \u2014 are raising money to buy school supplies for children in a homeless shelter where Ms. Carleton used to work, and to honor the memory of their friend, Nafice Hill.Ms. Carleton is an English teacher. Two decades ago, she worked as a tutor at The Drueding Center, a shelter for homeless families in North Philadelphia. That\u2019s where she met the Hill family. Nafice was about 7 years old then, living in the shelter with two siblings and his grandmother, Lorraine. In time, Ms. Hill found a home, earned a degree, and now works as an addiction counselor.\u201cIt felt like losing one of my own children,\u201d Ms. Carleton said. \u201cHe was one where I thought, \u2018he\u2019s going to do so well.\u2019\u201dBut as the Carleton kids pulled their jug of lemonade down Broad Street, displaying their poster and trying to tell their story, impatient delegates and shouting demonstrators kept passing them by.\u201cEveryone talks about the middle class. Few discuss the poor, the people struggling day to day.\u201dHe will obviously focus on the future and, in particular, on why a Hillary Clinton presidency would be good for the country. But he has no choice but to talk about the past as well. Clinton has cast herself as Obama\u2019s heir, and Obama will need to make a case that his presidency has been a success.Historically, Americans blame \u2014 or credit \u2014 the incumbent president for the state of the country. But something seems to have changed in recent years. With much of the Republican Party deeply and publicly committed to Obama\u2019s failure, many voters have come to understand that he isn\u2019t omnipotent.But it also needs to be a story that acknowledges the country\u2019s enduring problems. Perhaps above all, it should be a story about why Clinton can plausibly claim she will succeed where he did not.The most effective speech that Obama could give would not simply try to transfer his popularity to her. The most effective version would try to distinguish Clinton from Obama and lift her above him in some ways. No one has a better chance to do so than he does.David Leonhardt, who will begin an Op-Ed column later this year, is writing a daily opinion post during the conventions.Clearly, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have access to this information, so why do they reject it? But this denial of settled science doesn\u2019t just concern the climate. Consider vaccines. Remember the measles outbreak last year at Disneyland? This outbreak and others were completely preventable because measles vaccines are safe, inexpensive and effective. Now imagine that a new president encourages Americans not to get vaccinated, because he thinks the science is unsettled and maybe vaccines actually do cause autism. Millions of Americans decide not to get their children vaccinated \u2014 or at least delay doing so. The result would be a public health crisis. The rejection of science starts with ideology. It ends with people dying. \nColumnists Charles M.

{"Headline": "Amazon Expands Drone Testing in Britain", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Amazon has partnered with the British government to significantly expand drone testing, a move that could allow the devices to deliver packages to British homes far earlier than in the United States.Under the partnership, Britain\u2019s aviation regulator will let Amazon test several aspects of drone technology \u2014 such as piloting the machines beyond the line of sight of its operators \u2014 that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States has not permitted. The tests, which are an important sign of confidence in Britain after its historic vote last month to leave the European Union, are to begin immediately.\u201cThe U.K. is a leader in enabling drone innovation,\u201d Paul Misener, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global innovation policy and communications, said in a statement. \u201cThis announcement strengthens our partnership with the U.K. and brings Amazon closer to our goal of using drones to safely deliver parcels in 30 minutes to customers in the U.K. and elsewhere around the world.\u201dAmazon said it hoped success with the drone trials in Britain would encourage more hesitant regulators in the United States and elsewhere to loosen restrictions. The trials will \u201chelp identify what operating rules and safety regulations will be needed to help move the drone industry forward,\u201d the company said in a statement.Amazon will work with British regulators to test drones that fly beyond the line of sight of operators in rural and suburban areas. It will also test whether a single operator can safely command multiple drones at once, as well as technology that lets the machines automatically detect and avoid other planes, buildings and people.Mr. Bezos has since pointed to regulation as the biggest obstacle to the delivery of small packages by drones. The Seattle company has grown increasingly frustrated with the F.A.A.\u2019s cautious approach to its plans. Mr. Misener said in a Senate hearing in March 2015 that by the time regulators approved limited testing for certain Amazon drone models, those machines were already obsolete.Amazon has since moved more research and development of its drones to Britain, Canada and the Netherlands; the company views its partnership with Britain as its most advanced. The Civil Aviation Authority \u2014 the British equivalent of the F.A.A. \u2014 said it may also enter into similar partnerships with other commercial drone makers.\u201cWe want to enable the innovation that arises from the development of drone technology by safely integrating drones into the overall aviation system,\u201d said Tim Johnson, policy director of the Civil Aviation Authority. \u201cThese tests by Amazon will help inform our policy and future approach.\u201dUnited States regulators have been reluctant to permit drone delivery because of safety concerns. Amazon wants to be able to fly its drones at night and miles beyond the sight of operators. The company said it has developed \u201csense and avoid\u201d technology to prevent collisions, which it has not been able to broadly test in the United States.Amazon said it does not plan to decrease its drone investments in the United States and will continue to push for F.A.A. approval. Aviation analysts predict the United States will eventually permit drone delivery, but not in the next year or two.\u201cThe concern is that companies will significantly shift their drone testing or implementation programs to other countries,\u201d said Michael Sievers, co-chairman of the Unmanned Systems Group at Hunton & Williams, a law firm based in Richmond, Va. \u201cThis is more likely the case for near-term testing, but even then the effect is likely limited, as there is a cost to such relocations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crash Course in Honeymoon Survival", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byModern LoveI married a brawny Canadian, an amateur naturalist with an adventurous spirit disguised by a law degree and a 9-to-9 job in Times Square. Early in our relationship, I caught a glimpse behind this facade when I found his iPhone filled with close-up photos of bizarre insects and obscure reptiles. Later, I discovered his recent Google searches included \u201cwhite capuchin monkey howl\u201d and \u201ctardigrade mating habits.\u201dOur honeymoon began with a three-day camping trip in the Amazon rain forest. Jeremy booked the expedition through a lodge outside Iquitos, Peru, the only tour operator he could find that offered overnight stays in the open jungle. I agreed because it would be an opportunity to see Jeremy in remote wilderness, his most beloved environment. It would be like visiting his hometown together for the first time.We flew to Lima and then Iquitos, where we met our guide and traveled with him by boat to a small inlet along the Amazon River. The dilapidated lodge stood partly submerged, victim to the season\u2019s unusually fierce flooding.The rising water had washed away our trekking path, too. At Jeremy\u2019s insistence, the lodge hired a local trapper, Arnold, to lead us through uncharted territory with the lodge\u2019s own guide and tracker. Arnold lived alone in the jungle for weeks at a time. Towering foliage and oversize insects were his home territory; he would guide us through his backyard.At the outset, you could tell we were amateurs by our Osprey and Kelty backpacks. The lodge\u2019s guide and tracker slung giant potato sacks over their backs, while Arnold carried only a pink polyester girls school bag.I admired Jeremy in his jungle get-up. His dirt-crusted pants were tucked loosely into knee-high rubber boots. I watched the glint of his wedding ring appear and disappear as his hands swayed, a reminder of the lavishly joyous party we had thrown in Boston. Stomping along behind him, I wore a floppy-brimmed navy hat that I intended to look rugged but instead appeared quintessentially \u201cmiddle-age gardener.\u201dAfter five hours of hiking, we arrived at a clearing. Our companions quickly worked their machetes, building a shelter from tree trunks, netting and tarps. It was just enough to protect us from the rain, mosquitoes, bullet ants, scorpions, coral snakes and cacophony of other perilous creatures that fascinated Jeremy and terrified me.The lodge had sent our guides off with minimal rations: a bag of rice, two cans of tuna and a dozen eggs (10 of them broken). To supplement, we set out on an evening hunt. Our guides found a bird sleeping in a tree several meters up, then cut down a second tree and used it to club the bird from its perch. Dinner.Jeremy awoke in the middle of the night to pee. Despite our efforts to keep the mosquito net closed, half the jungle flew in the moment a corner was lifted. Jeremy ducked back, bladder unrelieved, to commence killing the cloud of insects one by one.By the next day, Arnold was lost. To avoid the flooding, we had left the path and followed him into swampy backwoods where each step looked identical to the next.Nearly out of food and dependent on our confused guides for survival, we suggested hacking our way south until we hit the Amazon River. Yet our guides had not packed a compass, and the foliage was too thick to track the sun. Instead, we walked aimlessly as Arnold scoured the undergrowth for remnants of a footpath. There were none.We awoke the next morning to a rifle shot. Arnold dragged a bloody peccary to our campsite. It was an Amazonian wild boar, and like nearly everything in the Amazon, it was larger and more vicious than its North American relative. With precision and a hint of showmanship, Arnold skinned and gutted the 90-pound animal. He cut down large palms and briskly wove them into a backpack, which he stuffed with the dripping meat and strapped to the outside of his girls backpack.The kill caused a split in our ranks. With speed we could not possibly match, Arnold and the tracker pushed ahead, leaving our guide, Jeremy and me with a single machete to bushwhack our path. Our guide shouted ahead before turning heavily to us. \u201cI think they have left us,\u201d he said, \u201cto find a way home before the meat spoils.\u201dAt some point, Jeremy and I would transition in our guide\u2019s mind from clients to baggage. Having grown up in the jungle, he could feed himself for days on plants and rodents, but he could not support the three of us for long.Resigned, we set up camp. I could no longer feign being outdoorsy, so I made the only contribution I could: I became an Amazonian homemaker. I wiped dirt from the tarp, then laid out the flat sheet and ran my hand over the wrinkles. I placed our After Bite at the top and a bottle for urinating at our feet. I put Jeremy\u2019s book on the right and mine on the left, an echo of the sleeping arrangement we developed on our plush Sealy mattress in New York.\u201cAre you scared?\u201d I asked.Jeremy squinted, raising his hand to block the beam of my headlamp. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said. \u201cWorse comes to worst, we get back a few days late and a bit hungry. There\u2019s probably enough information in my book to find edible food.\u201dLying on a tarp in the jungle that night, we felt entirely useless and infantile, unable to eat or walk without a guide. So we stitched together a false reality where we played important roles as comforter and protector, as receiver of comfort and beneficiary of protection.We talked about our lives. At a time when our future felt tenuous, we went ahead and created it, chattering about how many children we would have and what we would teach them. How we would instill a love of adventure and an understanding of the difference between risk and recklessness, something we were just beginning to grasp.\u201cMake me laugh?\u201d I asked.Jeremy folded his wrists back and held them up to his ears. \u201cWho am I?\u201dI giggled, a welcome moment of relief. \u201cThe dog.\u201d\u201cNow your turn,\u201d he said.Outside, we heard a muffled hum in the distance.\u201cA boat!\u201d our guide exclaimed. We could not be more than eight or 10 hours from the Amazon River. Tomorrow, we would follow the sound southward looking for a path to the river. From there, we could find a boat back to the lodge.Come dawn, that\u2019s exactly what we did.Our first step on the dock that evening was joyous. We threw down our packs and muscled off our wet rain boots. We sat in awe and silence and exhaustion until we regained the strength to drag ourselves to the honeymoon suite, a large room that had running water but lacked electricity.We showered. Lying side by side on a lumpy mattress, we counted our bruises. We were safe, together. I had paid my dues for my nature lover of a husband, and we were all the better for it.On the morning of our departure, we opted for one last short trek with our guide. Along the way, he called us over, pointing a stick at a coral snake resting under a large leaf. We crowded around.Jeremy confirmed the beauty of the animal and explained that its poison was neurotoxic. You could die within hours of respiratory arrest as your lungs failed to expand and your major organs wilted from hypoxia. There was a whole section on it in the Roosevelt book.With another poke, the snake lunged at us, lifting most of its body a foot in the air. \u201cRun, run, run!\u201d the guide shouted.The snake slithered away. So did we, first to Iquitos, then to a four-star hotel in Colombia, and finally, armed with our newfound survival skills, into the disorienting wilderness of married life.Sara Manning Peskin is a neurology resident at the University of Pennsylvania and the chief blogger at Borderwise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sad Day for Punchers: BlackBerry to Discontinue Traditional Keyboard Phone", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byThe struggling Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry made a sharp detour from its history on Tuesday when it announced it was discontinuing the last phone to have the traditional version of the company\u2019s iconic physical keyboard and trackpad.The Classic was introduced in late 2014 by BlackBerry to win back users who prefer plastic keys and trackpads to the touch screens that dominate the operation of its newer models, even ones with keyboards.Because the company does not break out sales of individual models, it is impossible to judge the Classic\u2019s reception. But BlackBerry\u2019s phone business is generally unprofitable and declining.Late last month, BlackBerry announced a quarterly loss of $670 million. That was about three times the company\u2019s loss in the previous quarter and largely reflected write-downs in the value of its phone business.The Classic ran the BlackBerry 10 operating system, which the company had hoped would again make it a vibrant force in smartphones. But it has since turned its attention to phones based on Google\u2019s Android software.Mr. Pini\u2019s post made no mention of the fate of the other BlackBerry 10 models, which still appeared on the company\u2019s website Tuesday evening.He did acknowledge, however, that some customers may still refuse to give up on the traditional BlackBerry shape regardless of the company\u2019s plans.Die-hards were encouraged by Mr. Pini to see if their carriers still had Classics available. He added that BlackBerry had some remaining stock on sale online.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about BlackBerry\u2019s discontinuation of the BlackBerry Classic smartphone erroneously attributed, in some editions, a distinction to the phone. It is the last BlackBerry phone with the traditional physical keyboard that dominates the face of the phone; it is not the last BlackBerry model with a physical keyboard. The error was repeated, in some editions, in the headline.An earlier version of a summary of this article online misstated the name of the model, introduced in 2014, that is being discontinued. It is the BlackBerry Classic, not BlackBerry 10.Advertisement"}

We puzzle more over certain drinks of more recent vintage, the ones that many of us associate with the 1970s and \u201980s and are embarrassed to utter, and others find so hilarious they just can\u2019t say them often enough. I\u2019ve never had an intense yearning for a drink made up of vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and cranberry juice, but \u2014 out of professional interest, of course \u2014 I\u2019ve had to make, and try, a Sex on the Beach more than once. If that\u2019s what a customer wants, that\u2019s what he or she will get.My mother was so amused by drinks with risqu\u00e9 names that she\u2019d make a great production of ordering them \u2014 especially, I\u2019m pretty sure, in my presence. And although the memory of the first time she visited me at a bar where I worked one summer and loudly called for a Slippery Nipple \u2014 in front of my boss, my co-workers, my regulars \u2014 still stings a little, I\u2019ve long since lightened up about such things.What I haven\u2019t lightened up about is the difficult art of inventing names for cocktails. Nearly every time I think I\u2019ve come up with something new and memorable, I peek in the indexes of my cocktail books or head to Google and discover that it\u2019s already taken. I try to strike a balance: something dignified, but not too serious. Something distinctive, but not too off-puttingly weird. The Bitter Darling (a rye-based cocktail with clementine juice and a good lashing of bitters) and La Puesta del Sol (a Spanish-inflected aperitif) are two of my favorite coinages. Straightforward stuff.But some braver creators of drink names seem instead to say: dignified, shmignified. Jill Dobias, of the restaurant Joe and Misses Doe in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, is a madcap master of mixed drinks and their names. She has one named after a guy who made a reservation at the restaurant for a Saturday night and never showed up. She has a tribute to our commander in chief called the Hot Obama. She has a variation on a screwdriver whose name I really can\u2019t go into here.And then she has a drink called the Clam in a Can. It\u2019s a delicious take on an oyster shooter that, to my palate, anyway, is also suggestive of a michelada \u2014 if the Maryland seashore was part of Mexico. I can\u2019t explain exactly why the name cracks me up, but it does.Maybe I\u2019ve just got a thing for drinks named for animals. Recently, one of my best friends handed me a drink he\u2019d created and dubbed Ojo del Komodo. I Anglicized it as Eye of the Komodo. In any case, name a drink after a lizard, and I may be instantly won over \u2014 but especially when it\u2019s the answer to the riddle: What\u2019s green and spicy and garnished with an eyeball?cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Races to Catch Up in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byBitsWhen it comes to cloud computing, Google is in a very unfamiliar position: seriously behind.\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest maker of computer servers is making machines just for these guys,\u201d said John Lovelock, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt\u2019s the nexus of things like big data, social networks and mobility, and the next big thing, which is artificial intelligence.\u201dFor Google, a loss in cloud computing would be a rare misstep for a company that revolutionized media with its advertising business, and then made the world\u2019s leading smartphone operating system.A victory for Google, however, could change how we work, turning advanced computing into an everyday utility that we use to run factories, interact in virtual reality or read one another\u2019s emotions. Given Google\u2019s track record, it\u2019s worth considering the prospect.But it will be an uphill climb.Google is moving rapidly to change things. Three announcements it made last week show how it hopes to gain ground on Amazon Web Services and Azure.First, the company said it has used artificial intelligence to cut the power use in its data centers 15 percent, a huge decrease considering how efficient these data factories were already.Power is probably the largest single cost for all three of the cloud companies. Google is almost certain to use its savings to reduce prices, much the way it won in search advertising by figuring out its competitors\u2019 costs, then undercutting them.\u201cThis certainly gives Google an edge,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people focused on narrow problems. We\u2019ve focused on the widest possible problem.\u201dGoogle also released for public use ways to transcribe and analyze recorded speech for things like meaning, emotional content and whether a speaker was happy or sad. An outside company that worked on the project \u2014 Google would not say which one \u2014 used it to analyze over two billion minutes of customer service calls. It works in 80 languages, Google said.At the same time, the company moved its customers on the United States West Coast from a data center in Iowa to facilities in Oregon. Google\u2019s network, which it claims is larger than the internet, can send the equivalent of 375 hours of video a second.A move like that only makes sense when a company wants to offer the kind of split-second performance needed for virtual reality or instantaneous customer interactions over networks of cellphones and sensors.Can faster networks, lower prices and lots of artificial intelligence put Google ahead? Amazon\u2019s lead seems to give it an edge for at least the next couple of years, as its cloud branch has perfected a method of developing hundreds of new cloud features annually. Yet while the company appears to have some basic artificial intelligence features, called machine learning, it seems to have little in the way of speech recognition or translation.Mr. Lovelock, the Gartner analyst, predicted that Google would offer businesses the insights it has gained from years of watching people online. \u201cAmazon views the customer as the person paying the bill, while Google believes the customer is the end user of a service,\u201d he said. And Microsoft is promoting itself as the company that has products customers already know and use.\u201cEveryone has to play to the strengths the market already sees they have,\u201d Mr. Lovelock said.Advertisement"}

This was all the more interesting since I noticed that STAR CROSSED LOVE is 15 letters long. If I ran this phrase across the middle of a puzzle, could I find sets of star-crossed lovers to go in each of the four corners?Let me tell you, there are a lot of options! John Lennon and Yoko Ono would do. But then so would Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Or Janet Leigh and Spencer Tracy.

BURTON-TAYLOR fit the bill, and it just so happens that their names fit symmetrically right across from BEATTY-BENING. (Although in fairness Burton-Taylor was a famously rocky relationship while Beatty-Bening have been together for years.)BOGART-BACALL was another obvious choice. But here the symmetry failed me. In the original version of this puzzle, I did have a solution: I used Clyde BARROW and Bonnie PARKER in perfect symmetry across from BOGART-BACALL.The problem of course is that all of the others are actors and actresses who are/were together on and off the screen. Bonnie and Clyde were real live people who have been portrayed in the movies, but it just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consistent with the rest of the theme.

His father was a computer programmer, and he was exposed to digital technology from early on. He gravitated to Nintendo Game Boy and eventually moved to the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation.At 11 or so, he said, he clicked on a banner ad by mistake and found an image depicting rape. By the time he had reached adolescence, so had the internet, and Mr. Rhodes came to rely on high-definition pornography that was easy to find and often free. By college, he was masturbating while watching it up to 14 times a day, he said.\u201cI would say, \u2018O.K., I have to take a few days to recover from this, like physically recover,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t last for even a day.\u201dMr. Rhodes\u2019s seeming dependence on porn didn\u2019t help matters with his first girlfriend, whom he started dating when he was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. It was his first real chance for sustained intimacy, and he blew it.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was all due to internet porn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you that the sex life didn\u2019t go very well. I had porn-induced erectile dysfunction \u2014 a very mild form, and this is all very self-diagnosed, because doctors won\u2019t diagnose this \u2014 but I was able to maintain an erection by fantasizing about pornography. That was the only way.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Rhodes was lost and in search of support. He created a discussion forum on Reddit on the topic of abstaining from masturbation and pornography. He realized he was far from alone and began his stand-alone site soon after.After college, he continued to build the site while working as a contractor for Google, specializing in data analysis. He said he earned good money and was able to put a good amount into the website (called NoFap.com, from a slang term for masturbation). But he was still using the supposed vice he was railing against. It took another failed relationship to get him to quit.\u201cI think I was relying on pornography as some kind of emotional crutch,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything bad would happen, you would go to porn, because it would always be there.\u201cI knew it was bad for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also realized it was bad for women I was involved with, and that was the moment that I said: \u2018I need to leave this thing behind. It is completely distorting my sexuality to the point where it could actually be harmful or at least not enjoyable for other people who I am involved with.\u2019\u201dMr. Rhodes came to believe he had a calling greater than his work in data analysis at Google. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision,\u201d he said of his leaving the job last year. \u201cBut ultimately it was what was best for humanity.\u201dThe website serves as an online umbrella for men looking to escape pornography. It has advertisements for porn-blocking software and online programs that promote the idea of steering clear of pornography and masturbation. The site also has discussion forums and includes testimonials by men sharing stories of their successes and failures.And it helps match men with \u201caccountability partners\u201d meant to serve as Alcoholics Anonymous-style sponsors, to keep a person on the right path. The site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertising, Mr. Rhodes said.To make it into something more robust, Mr. Rhodes needed to \u201ccome out\u201d as a spokesman of sorts. After he appeared in a New York magazine article in 2013 about men who had quit masturbating, he told his mother what was going on, much to her horror. Other interviews followed.While his family remains supportive, there are limits. When he showed his mother a recent article in Time magazine in which he was quoted, she said, joking, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be reading these types of things about my son,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, recalling his mother\u2019s reaction.He sat on one side of the church confessional while I sat on the other. \u201cTell me the last time you watched porn,\u201d I said, joking.Despite the location, he has largely kept away from religious people, especially evangelicals wanting to team up with him, even though such a relationship could help fund his work.\u201cI have viewpoints that don\u2019t mesh with their viewpoints,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cI\u2019m very sex-positive. I\u2019m not a religious person. I\u2019m not someone who supports religion. I\u2019m not against religion, but I don\u2019t support it. And I completely, firmly believe in premarital sex.\u201dMr. Rhodes said he has also endured the wrath of those on the other end of the ideological spectrum. People have tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to hack the site\u2019s servers, and its forums have been bombarded with pornographic images, he said. His father received pornography in the mail, Mr. Rhodes said, and he himself has gotten death threats.\u201cIt\u2019s just something you have to deal with and let the proper authorities follow up on anything,\u201d he said. Soon it would grow terribly cold, making for a terrible night of sleep in spite of a tent and a supposedly insulated sleeping bag that I bought at a suburban Target.On the morning of our second day, Mr. Rhodes sat near the extinguished campfire from the night before, laptop on his knees. Soon we\u2019d be departing the campsite, heading back to the city, to \u201ccivilization.\u201dBut first he had to present a webinar for another pornography-addiction outfit. During the chat, he spoke with people who asked about avoiding triggers. As the session continued, he spoke less about pornography than about the need to take care of oneself, both physically and emotionally. He talked about developing good habits and routines, about changing one\u2019s life in general.When a health care worker asked about fatigue and how he believed it often led him to pornography, Mr. Rhodes told the man that he needed to take care of his own health as well.\u201cIt\u2019s like if you\u2019re on an airplane flight,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cand they say, \u2018Oh, you have to put your oxygen mask on before assisting others with theirs.\u2019 It\u2019s because you\u2019ll pass out trying to get a mask on to somebody else. You have to make sure you\u2019re in a balanced spot in order to best serve other people, in order to best serve the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poland\u2019s Conservative Government Puts Curbs on State TV News", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byWARSAW, Poland \u2014 The ax fell for Piotr Maslak just 12 days into the new year, when his new boss at Poland\u2019s state television told him that there was no way to work together anymore, citing \u201cdifferent perspectives.\u201d Mr. Maslak, 40, agreed, and now says he is \u201cproud of being the first\u201d to be sent packing under the conservative government that took power seven months ago.\u201cThey did not want to participate in political pacification of the media,\u201d the group says on its website.\u201cThey took off the gloves and don\u2019t even attempt to hide anything,\u201d said Mr. Maslak, who worked for the state broadcaster for eight years. The message, he said, is: \u201cThat\u2019s the way we see national media. It must be representative of the government. If you don\u2019t agree, you don\u2019t have to work here.\u201dFriends followed him out the door in March, for example, when they argued that the television news should broadcast video of a large antigovernment protest that day, but their bosses ordered them to show a news conference of Poland\u2019s Roman Catholic episcopate instead.\u201cThey were fired the next day,\u201d said Mr. Maslak, who now works for a private radio station, TOK FM, where he hosts a breakfast talk show.Polish viewers are passing their own judgment \u2014 with the channel changer.In April, for the first time ever, the state broadcaster TVP1 \u2014 for years the most popular channel \u2014 placed third, behind two commercial channels, Polsat and TVN. State-run TVP2 took fourth place, according to a survey by Nielsen for Telewizja Polska, the state broadcasting corporation.All four channels have seen their audiences decline. In May 2015, their combined market share was 44.5 percent; this May, it was 41 percent. However, while Polsat and TVN lost 6.3 and 3.4 percentage points, respectively, TVP1 suffered an almost 20-point drop.Its flagship news program, \u201cWiadomosci,\u201d has lost 750,000 viewers and is now watched by fewer than three million people, a historic low.Jacek Kurski, the new director of Telewizja Polska, said the findings were not credible because the survey had been conducted by a \u201cforeign company\u201d that \u201cmanipulated the results.\u201dBut while Polish viewers may be tuning out, many outside the country are paying ever more attention to what is happening to Poland\u2019s news media.The 47-nation Council of Europe, the Continent\u2019s leading human rights body, has demanded transparent procedures for selecting and appointing the new National Media Council. Members of the media council should be qualified, independent and reflect social diversity, the Council of Europe said, and content should also be impartial and diverse. A proposal for dismissal of middle management should be abandoned, it added.The timing of that middle management purge seems already to have been pushed back to late September as Poland comes under the sway of two big events in the international spotlight: the NATO summit meeting in Warsaw on Friday and Saturday, and a visit by Pope Francis.Poland wants both events to go off unsullied by criticism from European arbiters. The Europeans, in turn, insist that they are not, as the Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, Nils Muiznieks, put it, \u201cpicking on Poland.\u201dJudging by recent editions of \u201cWiadomosci,\u201d the evening news program on state-run television, state broadcasters are now expected to instill patriotism and love of order. On June 16, after a long preview of Poland\u2019s soccer match against archrival Germany in the European championship tournament, the next-most important message was the deployment of official anticorruption forces to every Polish province.This sort of presentation, said Jacek Wasilewski, a media analyst, reflects the governing party\u2019s view of Poland as a nation that, while firmly of Europe, has its distinctive part to play. In this regard, he said, the news media \u201cis a constructed world of bad and good, in which every role is attributed.\u201dWhile young people everywhere are now tuning out conventional TV in favor of social media and virtual reality, Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s party is focused on television for a reason, Mr. Wasilewski said.\u201cOlder people are used to the TV set, and that\u2019s why Law and Justice stresses the power of television,\u201d he said.Marek Magierowski, a spokesman for Poland\u2019s president, said media control had long been a bone of contention. In 2011, he was fired as deputy editor of Rzeczpospolita, one of the two most influential newspapers, as it came under the control of an unknown investor who turned out to have close ties to the spokesman of the prime minister at the time, Donald Tusk.\u201cI was a victim,\u201d Mr. Magierowski said, \u201cbut there were no special sessions, no European Parliament, no words of caution\u201d from Brussels.Gazeta Wyborcza, the daily newspaper started by Adam Michnik as the mouthpiece of Poland\u2019s Solidarity movement, is losing readership, like most newspapers, but is still influential, Polish analysts said.But the conservatives in turn are building up clubs and other activities for listeners of the Catholic radio station Radio Maryja and readers of the weekly Gazeta Polska. The latter organizes readings of works the government likes and has increased its circulation into rare tens of thousands.In early June, Mr. Kaczynski himself addressed a national gathering of hundreds of these clubs. \u201cAs it turns out, there is a threat of dictatorship,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said mockingly of his opponents. \u201cWe are being compared to Fascists! Me, a modest man, I am being compared to Stalin, Hitler and Lenin.\u201dOn the contrary, he insisted: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to destroy democracy. We want to make it real.\u201dThe desire to create respected public service broadcasters has an echo in many former Communist countries, said former President Aleksander Kwasniewski, the only man to have served two five-year terms in that post. But, he noted, that goal may in itself be outdated.Particularly after a recent visit to Silicon Valley and a look at Google\u2019s work with artificial intelligence, he said he felt vindicated in a long-held conviction that it is more important to develop fresh political ideas than to control terrestrial TV.\u201cLiberal democracy is in crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI told my fellow politicians long ago, \u2018More vision, less television.\u2019 \u201dFollow Alison Smale on Twitter @asmalenyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank Group Nears Deal to Buy ARM Holdings", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byThe deal would be the first large-scale, cross-border transaction in Britain since it voted to exit the European Union last month. ARM had been seen as a safe haven from the volatility surrounding \u201cBrexit\u201d because its chip technology is used in mobile phones all over the world, with limited revenue derived from Britain.ARM, which designs chips and parts of chips, had a market capitalization of about $22 billion as of Friday\u2019s close. ARM would be one of SoftBank\u2019s largest acquisitions ever.ARM had been a leader in chips for mobile devices in the early years, while other semiconductor companies were focused on desktops. The switch to mobile has been difficult for ARM\u2019s competitors, particularly Intel, placing ARM in a prime position to dominate the market for chips used in cellphones and tablets.SoftBank, based in Tokyo, invests in technology, media and telecommunications companies, and ARM could provide an additional boost to SoftBank\u2019s mobile strategy. SoftBank owns about 83 percent of the American wireless operator Sprint, meaning that with the acquisition of ARM, SoftBank would own the carrier and the chip designer.Requests made to ARM for comment were not immediately returned. A representative from SoftBank declined to comment.SoftBank has made some big moves at the top as well. The company said last month that Nikesh Arora, who joined SoftBank two years ago from Google, would be leaving. He had been seen as the heir apparent to Masayoshi Son, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, and someone who could catapult SoftBank and its global ambitions through deal making. But once he stepped down, Mr. Son signaled that he was not yet ready to give up control.ARM has become somewhat of a secret success. The company, based in Cambridge, England, makes chips for a large majority of the world\u2019s cellphones. ARM generates more than $1 billion in annual revenue by licensing its designs to large chip-makers.ARM traces more than half of its revenue to Asia, while about 38 percent comes from North America. Only 1 percent of its revenue is from Britain, according to its latest annual report.ARM was founded in 1990 and has grown into a company with 4,000 employees, a majority of them engineers. In 2015, ARM\u2019s customers said they shipped about 15 billion chips, with just under half of those going into mobile devices, the company said in its annual release.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Approves New Trans-Atlantic Data Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEuropean officials approved a new agreement on Tuesday that will allow some of the world\u2019s largest companies, including Google and General Electric, to move digital information freely between the European Union and the United States.Here\u2019s a primer on what was announced, what happens next and how it might affect you.What is the Privacy Shield and why does it matter? What are the main points? The pact bolsters privacy guarantees for anyone living in Europe \u2014 but not for people in the United States \u2014 when their data is shifted across the Atlantic. Many Europeans fear that their information might be used inappropriately by the United States government, including its intelligence agencies, and by companies.The new safeguards include a greater say for Europeans on how their information is used, the right to go to American courts when people think companies or the United States government may have misused their data, and written guarantees from American officials that government agencies will not indiscriminately collect and monitor Europeans\u2019 data without cause.A new position has been created in the State Department to handle European complaints that American intelligence agencies or other government departments may have unfairly collected and used people\u2019s digital data.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Why are Europeans so afraid of the United States government? Call it the Snowden factor. After the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed in 2013 that American intelligence agencies were actively spying on people worldwide, including in Europe, the region\u2019s population, policy makers and lawmakers were up in arms. Since the revelations, multiple legal cases have been filed across Europe, particularly involving United States tech companies caught up in the scandal, in an attempt to rein in these activities.Is everyone happy with the Privacy Shield? American and European officials say the pact goes further than the previous deal, ensuring that Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules are respected and replicated when data is moved to the United States.Where does that leave us? It remains unclear whether Europe\u2019s highest court could eventually overturn the pact, but legal experts say the case, if filed, would not be heard until late 2017 at the earliest. In the meantime, companies are spending tens of millions of dollars to ensure that their data protection rules meet Privacy Shield standards, and privacy groups are searching for test cases to use in their efforts to overturn the new agreement. (Filings are expected within months.)In the face of this uncertainty, the credibility of American and European officials is on the line. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and the United States Department of Commerce spent years negotiating the new deal. If it were eventually overturned in court, few companies or privacy experts would have faith that either side could do any better the next time around.\u201cThere always will be criticism because we don\u2019t have an equivalent legal system with the U.S.,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Justice commissioner who negotiated the Privacy Shield, said in an interview.\u201cI\u2019m looking at the practical positive impact that Privacy Shield will have,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not focused on what may happen with legal challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robert Fano, 98, Dies; Engineer Who Helped Develop Interactive Computers", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byRobert Fano, an electrical engineer who was instrumental in creating a world of instantly responsive computers, died on July 13 in Naples, Fla. He was 98.His daughter Paola Nisonger confirmed his death.As a pioneering computer designer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Fano made fundamental theoretical advances, both in the ways computers handled information and in the design of interactive software that made it possible for the machines to support many simultaneous users.Building on the idea of shared computing proposed in 1961 by John McCarthy, an artificial intelligence researcher, Dr. Fano collaborated with another electrical engineer, Fernando J. Corbato, to develop the first time-sharing computer operating system, known as Compatible Time-Sharing System, or CTSS, to run on an IBM computer.Before the advent of time-sharing, computers were largely walled off from users in glass rooms. Programs were run sequentially, submitted in decks of punched cards. Users then returned later \u2014 often one or two days \u2014 to receive the output as printouts.The system was notoriously frustrating, Dr. Fano recalled in a 1985 lecture: \u201cIf you misplaced a comma in any program, well, those two days were gone!\u201dCTSS marked a fundamental shift leading to a more interactive computing world in which users worked at individual terminals. It also soon led to Project MAC, an M.I.T. computation center for which Dr. Fano was the founding director in 1963. It ushered in a world where computing influenced a wide range of new ideas, ultimately including personal computing.Dr. Fano recalled picking up the challenge because no one else stepped forward.\u201cAt a certain point, I decided if nobody was ready to get the ball rolling, I was going to do it, although my experience with computers was close to nil,\u201d he said in an interview with the filmmaker Errol Morris.He said the project also helped establish the field of computer science apart from electrical engineering.\u201cThe whole concept of Multics was going to be something that revolutionized the way people used computers in a way that was humanistic and friendly,\u201d said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist who was then a Bell Labs researcher who participated in the project.Project MAC was also significant in training a generation of technologists who would spread ideas far beyond the insular community of hackers who built the original system.Two of the early Project MAC designers were Daniel Bricklin and Robert Frankston, M.I.T. students who went on to develop the Visicalc spreadsheet program, which was instrumental in bringing personal computing to the business world.Mr. Frankston recalled that Dr. Fano was interested in the social aspect of computing. \u201cThe Multics project was about interactive computing, which kept people involved,\u201d he said. \u201cContrast that with Google\u2019s goal of a driverless car with people reduced to being passengers.\u201dComputing was one of several fields Dr. Fano pursued. His interest in information theory was piqued one day in 1948 as a young professor of electrical engineering at M.I.T., when Norbert Wiener, a mathematician who coined the term cybernetics, poked his head into Dr. Fano\u2019s office and said cryptically: \u201cYou know, information is entropy.\u201dRobert Mario Fano was born in Turin, Italy, on Nov. 11, 1917. He was a student at the School of Engineering of Torino in 1939 when his family was forced to move to the United States in the face of Mussolini\u2019s anti-Jewish legislation.After getting his undergraduate degree at M.I.T., he worked briefly at General Motors, supervising operators of welding machines, but he quickly returned to graduate studies at M.I.T. During World War II, he joined the Radiation Laboratory there and was involved in the development of microwave radar. He spent a decade in information theory before turning his attention to computing.Besides his daughter Paola, Dr. Fano is survived by two other daughters, Linda Ryan and Carol Fano, and five grandchildren.An obituary on Thursday about Robert Fano, an electrical engineer who was instrumental in creating a world of instantly responsive computers, misspelled the surname of the mathematician who coined the term cybernetics.

Based on the childhood bug collecting passion of its creator, Satoshi Tajiri, it let players seek out and collect Pok\u00e9mon, then train them into powerful warriors.Nintendo assumed Pok\u00e9mon would not catch on in America: \u201cIt was role-playing, with minimal graphics, battles that ended with one fighter \u2018fainting\u2019 instead of dying, and an obsessive compulsive goal of finding 150 critters wandering in the woods,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote.But it also had cutting-edge innovations. Players could connect their Game Boys with a cable to battle each other, foreshadowing today\u2019s connected mobile games. It was also an early example of what the gaming industry would come to call casual games: Games that can be put down and picked up again whenever the user likes.Many games of the era had an end, like a big villain to defeat, that players could race to if they focused on the game for hours or days. Even after collecting all the Pok\u00e9mon and defeating increasingly powerful opponents, a player could keep playing and battling friends.Smartphones seemed like a natural fit for Pok\u00e9mon when they emerged more than a decade later. The Pok\u00e9mon Company, which owns the Pok\u00e9mon characters and is partially owned by Nintendo, released a free app game to promote the trading cards in 2011. But Nintendo said it would not sell games on any app stores.Nintendo was at a crossroads in other ways. In 2013, its longtime president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, died. Last year, Satoru Iwata, a former Nintendo chief executive and a game designer who supported the Pok\u00e9mon Go project, also died.Pok\u00e9mon Go demonstrates that Nintendo\u2019s stable of characters \u2014 which also includes the mustachioed plumber Mario, a princess named Zelda, and her savior, Link \u2014 can form the basis for others to develop lucrative mobile games. But that would turn Nintendo into a different kind of company \u2014 one, Mr. Ryan says, that is content to hit singles and doubles rather than swing for the fences.\u201cIt would make them a ton of money and it would secure their reputation for 100 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would also not make them Nintendo anymore.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jonathan Soble from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Makers of Self-Driving Cars Ask What to Do With Human Nature", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byWheelsThe question is relevant not only for cars of the future but also for ones already on the road.While the Tesla Model S has been getting all the attention in the last week, the fact is that many cars, including models from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, now have systems that use a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping and automatic braking to enable drivers to briefly take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road.Some Tesla drivers have reveled in making videos of themselves using the Autopilot feature. But the more conventional automakers have designed their systems to take control of the car for only a few seconds at a time; the driver must be ready to resume command at any time.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration classifies such vehicles and their limited automation as Level 2 cars. So what level should come next?In the safety agency\u2019s taxonomy, the next step would be Level 3, which describes vehicles that can drive on their own in specific circumstances, such as on the highway, but still require a human driver to be \u201cavailable for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time.\u201dBut the technology giant Google, as it continues working toward what the company hopes will one day be a commercially available autonomous vehicle, has concluded that meeting such a requirement is not possible and the only safe way to proceed is to take the driver out of the equation. Some conventional automakers are beginning to agree.Volvo, whose Level 2 cars include the 2017 S90, has decided to skip the Level 3 stage. Like Google, Volvo is pursuing Level 4 cars \u2014 fully autonomous vehicles that don\u2019t require any driver input aside from setting a destination.A car changing lanes at 50 miles per hour should not expect a driver to be able to suddenly take control, said Erik Coelingh, who leads Volvo\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research program, Drive Me. \u201cSome people can take control in 10 seconds, but if someone fell asleep it could take two minutes,\u201d he said.\u201cI was in a driving simulator a couple of weeks ago, and they asked me to play Dots on my phone\u201d while the virtual car was in control, Mr. Coelingh said. \u201cThen there was a voice asking me politely to take control, and I was like, \u2018Just give me a couple more seconds to beat the high score.\u2019\u201dExperiments conducted last year by Virginia Tech researchers and supported by the national safety administration found that it took drivers of Level 3 cars an average of 17 seconds to respond to takeover requests. In that period, a vehicle going 65 m.p.h. would have traveled 1,621 feet \u2014 more than five football fields.Despite such startling findings, some automakers and researchers say it is too soon to abandon human intervention as vehicles become more autonomous.\u201cI\u2019m hesitant to write off Level 3,\u201d said Shane McLaughlin, the director of the Center for Automated Vehicle Systems at Virginia Tech, who thinks additional technology may yet solve the human handoff problem. \u201cI feel like we can get the machine to give the person enough time to react,\u201d he said.The driver of a Tesla in self-driving mode was recently killed in an accident in Florida. The company called the driver \u201ca friend of Tesla\u201d and the broader community. Below is a look at how some Tesla enthusiasts engage with the technology.Such solutions might involve video and infrared systems in the car that monitor the driver\u2019s attentiveness. So-called electronic horizon technologies might also give drivers more time to react by \u201cseeing\u201d farther down the road, with cars able to automatically communicate with one another.Those in favor of taking a step-by-step transition that includes Level 3 cars point to the serious challenges still facing developers of fully autonomous Level 4 vehicles.Gill Pratt, who was recruited to lead Toyota\u2019s five-year, $1 billion project in automotive artificial intelligence, gave a presentation in January highlighting the ways a completely autonomous vehicle would need to be able to handle unusual situations.A viable autonomous car would need to be able, he said, to avoid a mattress falling off a moving truck on a crowded highway, even if it had never encountered such a situation before.Audi also supports incremental advances, rather than trying to leap ahead to fully autonomous cars. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure the conditions are right to begin Level 3,\u201d said Brad Stertz, Audi\u2019s director of government affairs. \u201cThe key part is focusing on driver availability.\u201dMr. Stertz said that when Audi was ready to offer Level 3 features, its system would give drivers audible and visual warnings if they appeared not to be paying attention. The system, planned for an Audi A8 in model year 2018, would at first be able to drive itself only under specific circumstances, such as in stop-and-go traffic on the highway at 35 m.p.h. or slower.Mr. Stertz and Mr. McLaughlin, of Virginia Tech, both stressed the importance of industry standards for partly autonomous Level 3 vehicles.BMW\u2019s recent announcement that it was working with Intel and Mobileye to bring Level 3 and Level 4 cars to market seemed to acknowledge the idea that standards were needed. BMW said the result of the collaboration would be an open platform that could be used by other manufacturers.But industry standards do not yet exist. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected this summer to release new guidelines for testing self-driving vehicles on public roads. The question many now have is whether those recommendations will still include Level 3 vehicles and how the results may be affected by the agency\u2019s investigation of the Tesla Model S accident.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Yorkers Greet the Arrival of Wi-Fi Kiosks With Panic, Skepticism and Relief", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byWhen it comes to acceptance of New York City\u2019s rapidly growing network of sidewalk kiosks offering \u201cfree super fast Wi-Fi,\u201d some people are Nekeya Browns and some are Alex Padillas.As soon as the LinkNYC booths were activated in their Washington Heights neighborhood this month, Ms. Brown celebrated by plugging in her headphones and swaying to some Marvin Gaye tunes; Mr. Padilla, in his Yankees jersey, stood a few feet back, reluctant even to touch the keyboard for fear of having his pocket of personal data picked.Mr. Padilla, 60, said his primary concern was \u201chaving to give them information,\u201d not that he was certain who \u201cthey\u201d were. Ms. Brown, a young woman in brightly patterned tights, was practically giddy as she appraised a glowing kiosk on West 142nd Street in Manhattan.\u201cWhoever thought of this was a great person,\u201d she said, listing all of the benefits of the kiosks. \u201cI told a homeless lady that whenever you need to call your family, you can use this.\u201dAnd so it goes in the first stage of the citywide rollout of these curbside machines that promise swift connections to the internet, phone service and ports for charging cellphones and other devices, all at no cost to the users. With the activation this week of the first units to be installed in Queens, there will be about 300 online, almost all of them in Manhattan.Along Eighth Avenue in Midtown, some homeless people are camping around the kiosks. Sascha Freudenheim, who runs a consulting firm on West 36th Street, said the way some people were using the kiosks \u201cseems completely counter to their purpose.\u201d Mr. Freudenheim said he thought they would be used to help people find their way around the city, not serve as gathering spots.Residents of more residential neighborhoods have complained that the kiosks are too bright, too loud and more attractive to idle squatters than they are to busy passers-by in need of a quick connection. Other New Yorkers are demonstrating their usual skepticism, eyeing the kiosks warily and wondering what the catch is.Aniya Lee, 16, frequently uses the kiosk at 183rd Street and Creston Avenue in the Bronx, but only to play songs on YouTube on the video screen. She said she did not feel comfortable using the Wi-Fi or connecting her phone to the USB outlet.\u201cFor some reason, I don\u2019t trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to get everyone\u2019s information.\u201dCity officials are hoping that the public\u2019s long-term relationship with the tall, slim kiosks settles in somewhere between standoffish and clingy. They admit they did not know what to expect; no other city has tried to create anything quite as extensive as LinkNYC.\u201cThis is an unprecedented project,\u201d said Anne Roest, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. \u201cWe are going to have to make adjustments to make them better. A lot of these things are things that really we weren\u2019t anticipating when we went live.\u201dIf all goes according to the plan, the kiosks will be as commonplace as pay phones once were: more than 7,500, spread throughout every neighborhood of the city. Most of them will replace former pay phones, though the company installing them has begun choosing additional sidewalk sites.That company, actually a consortium known as CityBridge, is behind schedule on the rollout. Under its franchise agreement with the city, more than 500 kiosks were to be working by this month, in all five boroughs.CityBridge executives said their progress was slowed by several factors, including the strike by Verizon employees and a lawsuit filed by Telebeam, a company that controlled about 1,300 pay phones in the city. Telebeam challenged the city\u2019s granting of an exclusive franchise to CityBridge; a federal judge dismissed the suit this month.Jen Hensley, the general manager of LinkNYC, said some former pay phone sites had proven unsuitable for the kiosks. In those instances CityBridge has started seeking approvals from local community boards to place the machines in other spots.So far, most of the kiosks have been placed along Third and Eighth Avenues in Manhattan, aligned with fiber-optic cable already laid to provide fast wireless connections to the internet. After Queens, the network will extend to Brooklyn and then to Staten Island, Ms. Hensley said.CityBridge has only just begun to assess how successful the system is, Ms. Hensley said. But city officials said they were pleased with the early use and the adjustments CityBridge had made, including lowering the maximum volume at night in response to noise complaints.Nearly 275,000 people have registered to use the kiosks, which requires users to provide an email address. Once a smartphone is registered, it will automatically connect to the Wi-Fi signals that radiate from the kiosks and extend 100 feet or more.Close to one million of those connections are being made weekly, according to CityBridge statistics. In July, users initiated about 40,000 sessions on the built-in computer screens and made about 23,000 phone calls per week.Last weekend, experts on digital data and online privacy were wondering what CityBridge planned to do with all of the personal information made available. Benjamin Dean, a fellow in cybersecurity and internet governance at Columbia University, and Mariko Hirose, a senior staff attorney for the New York Civil Liberties Union, raised that question at a gathering of hackers in Manhattan.The civil liberties organization has asked city officials to revise LinkNYC\u2019s privacy policy, arguing that it allows the system\u2019s operators to collect all sorts of data about users and sell it to other companies. Ms. Hensley said CityBridge executives were working with city officials on revising the current policy.\u201cWe don\u2019t have plans to collect any additional data in the future,\u201d Ms. Hensley said.Contrary to some people\u2019s fears, she said, the consortium is barred from sending ads to users\u2019 phones.\u201cWe know way less about you than your mobile phone provider does,\u201d she said.CityBridge maintains that its business model involves selling ads on the large, lighted panels on the sides of the kiosks, essentially small billboards that will line the busiest blocks of the city. It has pledged to share at least $500 million in ad revenue with the city over the first 12 years.But Mr. Dean said he was doubtful, in part because of the involvement of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. It owns Sidewalk Labs, an investor in one of the members of the CityBridge consortium.\u201cWhat Google\u2019s doing here is taking the business model that they\u2019ve perfected in the online world and bringing it into the real world,\u201d Mr. Dean said in an interview.Despite the warnings of critics like Mr. Dean, city officials seem determined to push ahead with a network that they say will provide valuable benefits, to people much like Jose Soto, a 35-year-old Washington Heights resident.On a hot day in early July, Mr. Soto squatted in the shade near a LinkNYC kiosk, typing texts on his basic cellphone to his wife in Panama. \u201cI don\u2019t pay my internet this month,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cThis is good for a lot of people.\u201dSamantha Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But in poor countries like Pakistan, few people have internet access while many have cellphones, Dr. Subramanian said.In Lahore, mosquito-borne diseases surge each September as the first monsoons create pools of water in which mosquitoes breed. The hotline was created after a large 2011 dengue outbreak swamped local hospitals.Residents are encouraged to call and describe their symptoms so they can be told whether to see a doctor and which hospitals have room.They can also complain about uncollected garbage or old tires, where mosquitoes breed, or ask that mosquito-control teams visit their neighborhoods. The teams spray houses, put larvicide in water sources or even drop tilapia minnows, which eat mosquito larvae, into pools of water.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chasing Pok\u00e9mon, a Baby Step Toward Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In this season of random assassinations and political uproar, who could resist the temptation to supplement a high-strung and frightening reality with some gentle make-believe?It is, in essence, digitally enhanced bird-watching: Find fantastic creatures like Weedle and Golbat in the wild, collect as many as possible, and get personal satisfaction and bragging rights from doing so.To answer that question, I downloaded the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, which involved giving up my rights to trial by jury, agreeing that my content could be the game\u2019s content but the game\u2019s content would never be my content, and stating I was not on the United States government\u2019s list of prohibited or restricted parties. There were also many other clauses I didn\u2019t bother to read.Then I charged my phone and proceeded to Dolores Park, a deeply green expanse in the center of the city that was the site of San Francisco\u2019s first large planned Pok\u00e9mon Go event on Wednesday.It was 69 degrees, a perfect summer evening. The app told me I was passing the place where the poet Robert Frost was born. A plaque marked the spot, which was a location in the game. Pok\u00e9mon quoted Frost:Such was life in the Golden Gate:Gold dusted all we drank and ate,And I was one of the children told,\u201cWe all must eat our peck of gold.\u201dThis was a promising omen, Pok\u00e9mon telling me interesting things I never knew about a locale steps from my office. In the park, people spread languidly, smoking dope and playing with their dogs, not a care in the world. Slowly a group congregated near a statue of Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican independence. It was nearly all young and overwhelmingly white. In other words, it looked like Silicon Valley \u2014 although with a greater female presence.Everyone stared down at their phones, catching the creatures that the app superimposed on the landscape. Aaron Orcino was drinking a can of beer he had brought along. The appeal, he said, \u201cwas the randomness. You don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\u201dBut surely he had other excellent options for an evening\u2019s entertainment?\u201cNo, this is the best thing,\u201d he said.He was kidding, a bit. Mr. Orcino works at Facebook, and so at least some of his interest was professional. \u201cI am studying it, learning the dynamics,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see how long people can continue playing before Pok\u00e9mon has to introduce a new game play element\u201d \u2014 up the stakes, in other words.Fifty years ago, the F.B.I., worried that the youth of America might foment revolution, would infiltrate San Francisco demonstrations. Now the tech companies are doing the monitoring, wondering if games like Pok\u00e9mon represent a threat that must be neutralized or an opportunity to be exploited. That\u2019s progress for you.For what seemed like a long time, it wasn\u2019t clear if anything would actually happen in the park. Television journalists did interviews. Haagen-Dazs distributed free ice cream. Less than three weeks old, Pok\u00e9mon Go was fulfilling its destiny as a marketing and media opportunity.Finally we set off, perhaps 200 of us. A larger and somewhat more diverse crowd, maybe 600 or so, departed from the opposite terminus, the Ferry Building, and marched in our direction. Like just about everything else involving new technology, the size of the projected crowd had been seriously overhyped.We walked, collecting Pok\u00e9mon along the way. Sergio Gonzalez was carrying a bottle of Veuve Cliquot Champagne, which he generously shared. \u201cThis is my childhood coming into fruition,\u201d said Mr. Gonzalez, a sommelier who was 9 in 1996 when the original Pok\u00e9mon debuted. \u201cI\u2019m reconnecting with my generation.\u201dHe turned to the woman he was walking with. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to hang out, let\u2019s be formally introduced,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Sergio.\u201dI read an email from Michael Saler, the author of \u201cAs If: Modern Enchantment and the Literary Prehistory of Virtual Reality\u201d and an expert on the augmented life that technology companies are creating for us.He was guardedly optimistic. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go is making everything new again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the enticement of the hunt, but coming across other people doing the same thing. These apps are going from pure fantasy games to helping us appreciate reality a bit more. It shows that nature and fantasy aren\u2019t opposites, that they can come together.\u201dMr. Saler added: \u201cWe always think of these innovations as a new heaven on Earth or the ninth level of hell. But it\u2019s never one or the other, there are always disadvantages and advantages.\u201dInstead, there was widespread enthusiasm for getting people outdoors by any means possible. People on our trek agreed this was little short of a miracle.\u201cIf you had told me a week ago I should go outside, I would have said, What?\u201d said Anton, a programmer who declined to give his last name. He said he now played Pok\u00e9mon Go for hours at a time, running in parks to collect the animals.That\u2019s one way to look at it. Another, of course, is that the game tethers people even more firmly to their devices in the one place they used to be able to at least partly escape from them: outdoors. On the Pok\u00e9mon Crawl Survival Kit, posted on the Facebook page, among the items to bring was a \u201cphone charger and portable charge.\u201d Many did, their phone cables disappearing into their backpacks.I tried to take the train home to the East Bay, but something was obstructing the track. BART, perpetually overcrowded and frequently overwhelmed, said there would be no trans-bay service, perhaps for hours. It recommended a trans-bay bus but, in the crowd-counting spirit of Silicon Valley, I\u2019d estimate there were at least 9,000 people at the terminal.There was nothing to do but summon Uber, which informed me that surge pricing was in effect and that normal fares would be somewhere between double and triple. My usual $5 trip home cost $76. Another peck of gold for Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

They were far more interested in whether Yahoo\u2019s web, email, news and other businesses will finally be sold \u2014 and at what price.Ms. Mayer had little to say about the potential sale in a webcast with investors to discuss the results. She noted that the company had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d on the strategic review process but offered no timeline for a decision.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Yahoo\u2019s flailing business will make it difficult to get top dollar for the company. According to the research firm eMarketer, Yahoo will get about 1.5 percent of the world\u2019s digital ad revenue this year, down from 2.1 percent last year. By comparison, Google is expected to command 30.9 percent of the market and Facebook is expected to garner 12 percent.Analysts expect the final bids to come in at $3.5 billion to $6 billion, including Yahoo\u2019s land and patents.The write-off of most of the value of the Tumblr blogging network is emblematic of the failure of Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategy to expand Yahoo by luring the mobile young users who drive the business of its chief rivals, Google and Facebook.Yahoo said it was writing off an additional $482 million of Tumblr\u2019s purchase price on top of the $230 million write-off it took in the first quarter.In the second quarter, Yahoo\u2019s revenue was $1.31 billion, up from $1.24 billion in the same quarter a year ago. But the most recent quarter\u2019s revenue rose only because of a change in how Yahoo accounts for revenue from its search partnership with Microsoft. Excluding those changes, revenue fell 15 percent, and both search ads and display ads posted significant drops.The company reported a net loss of $440 million, or 46 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss $22 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the Tumblr write-off and other adjustments, the company\u2019s operating profit fell 64 percent.Shares of Yahoo were down slightly in after-hours trading Monday evening.Ms. Mayer noted that one bright spot for the industry, video advertising, was beginning to see price drops in the face of a glut of inventory as Facebook, Twitter and others churn out more live video and clips. \u201cThere\u2019s so much video, particularly mobile video, coming online that there is some price compression,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Trains were rerouted, forcing riders to disembark and walk several blocks or ride a shuttle bus to get back on a train.So Mr. Alyajouri turned to his cellphone to find a better solution.As cities grow and concerns about pollution and congestion rise, commuters in urban areas are increasingly turning to apps to compare and combine public and private transportation alternatives. \u201cThe shared modes complement public transit, enhancing urban mobility,\u201d said Darnell Grisby, director of policy development and research at the American Public Transportation Association, a trade group based in Washington.Mr. Alyajouri downloaded RideTap, located and booked a Car2Go while still on the train, disembarked and walked to his reserved car to drive downtown.Nationwide, mass transit use stalled during the last decade. According to the Census Bureau, 76.5 percent of commuters drove alone, 9.2 percent car-pooled and 5.2 percent used mass transit in 2014, the latest year for which figures were available. In 2005, 77 percent drove alone, 10.7 percent car-pooled and 4.7 percent used public transportation.Apps hold the promise of altering those percentages by showing passengers how to travel from home to a transit stop and then to their ultimate destination, the so-called first mile-last mile of a commute. Since January, app-based pilot projects have been introduced in Los Angeles, Denver, Portland, Memphis, the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina, and Kansas City, Mo.Cities \u201care in competition with each other for very scarce dollars,\u201d said Ray LaHood, a former secretary of transportation. In May, the Federal Transit Administration announced $8 million in funding to support research and technology so cities could experiment with new operational models. Applications were due by July 5, and a winner will be announced in the fall.Separately, the Department of Transportation pledged up to $40 million to one city to help define what it means to be a \u201csmart city,\u201d with innovative technologies including self-driving cars, connected vehicles and smart sensors incorporated into a transportation network. The department chose Columbus, Ohio, from the 78 cities that applied. Columbus will receive an additional $10 million for electric vehicles and to reduce carbon emissions from Vulcan Inc., a company started in Seattle by the philanthropist Paul G. Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.\u201cIt\u2019s on-demand microtransit,\u201d said Robbie Makinen, president and chief executive of the authority.The $1.50 fare is the same as city bus passengers pay. Mr. Makinen said he anticipated a total ridership of 200 passengers a day after the first six months.Tina Rainey traded a two-bus commute for a single van ride of five minutes to her job as a transporter at the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. At the end of her 4 p.m. shift, oftentimes, \u201cI\u2019m the only one in the van,\u201d she said.Co-workers told her they couldn\u2019t use the service because it stopped running a half-hour before their shifts ended at 7 p.m. The transit authority said it was aware of unmet needs, and Mr. Makinen said he was optimistic about securing funding.Some say the efforts by Ford, which supplies vans in Kansas City, and Daimler, which owns Moovel and Car2Go, in Portland signal a new model for getting access to cars for shorter and more efficient commutes.\u201cMany automobile companies are now investing in shared mobility or transportation as a service either through direct provision of these services, acquisitions, investments and public-private partnerships, or all of the above,\u201d Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email. \u201cThey are also investing in connected and automated vehicle technology, which is now converging with transportation as a service.\u201dExperts expect these experiments to continue.\u201cThere\u2019s an insatiable demand,\u201d said Robert J. Puentes, president and chief executive of Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank in Washington.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a transit system in Memphis and the Raleigh-Durham area.

While major technology companies see a future in smart thermostats and toasters, the technology has not yet become widely available. At the same time, global sales of smartphones have slowed, showing the mobile future has limits.\u201cARM and SoftBank have an overlap on how we see the future,\u201d Simon A. Segars, ARM\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. But he left the door open for another offer. \u201cNow that the offer is in the public domain, if anyone wants to make a counteroffer, they are more than welcome to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a possibility of someone counterbidding.\u201dBritish leaders, under pressure to address global worries about the country\u2019s future outside the European Union, portrayed the deal as an endorsement. \u201cSoftbank\u2019s decision confirms that Britain remains one of the most attractive destinations globally for investors to create jobs and wealth,\u201d Philip Hammond, the new chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a statement.Mr. Son said he was a \u201cstrong believer in the U.K.,\u201d and he added that he had spoken with Mr. Hammond and Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, about the deal on Sunday.SoftBank already has ties to ARM through Sprint, the American wireless carrier that it controls. Mr. Son said he first spoke with ARM\u2019s chairman about two weeks ago regarding a possible takeover, and added that the deal came together quickly. The two sides eventually agreed to a price \u2014 more than 70 times ARM\u2019s net earnings in 2015. The deal is expected to close in November.Mr. Son described the deal as a bet on the \u201cinternet of things,\u201d a new stage in the evolution of network technology, when cars, buildings and household items may be connected through embedded electronics. He framed the social and economic implications in grand terms.\u201cFirst there was the internet, then the mobile internet and next there will be the internet of things, which is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cI\u2019m making this investment at the very beginning of this shift.\u201dARM Holdings may not be a household name, but it is most likely that one of the company\u2019s chip designs powers your smartphone, tablet or other mobile device. It devises chips and parts of chips that use less power so that they can be used in smaller gadgets. ARM had a market capitalization of about $22 billion as of Friday\u2019s close, and the proposed acquisition represents a 43 percent premium over the company\u2019s closing share price last week.Started in 1990 as a spinoff from Acorn Computers, a now-defunct British computer maker, ARM has gone from a small start-up of fewer than 20 people to a global leader whose technology is used in more than 90 percent of smartphones produced by Apple and Samsung, among others.ARM took an early lead on chips for mobile devices, while the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets has been more challenging to traditional chip makers like Intel.Unlike Intel, ARM forgoes the high margins \u2014 and equally high production costs \u2014 of directly manufacturing microchips. Instead, its engineers design chips, which are then licensed to larger technology companies like Qualcomm that pay ARM fees and royalties for manufacturing the chips.The company\u2019s revenue totaled a mere $1.5 billion last year, compared with $55.4 billion for Intel over the same period. But as ARM\u2019s chips have become increasingly powerful, the company\u2019s stable of customers have begun to create devices that directly compete with those powered by Intel. That can be seen in particular in the world of computer servers, which have become the lifeblood of the internet as people\u2019s online activities move into the cloud.As smartphone sales have slowed, ARM has invested millions of dollars in chip designs aimed at new customers, including automakers and household product companies, that are looking to add internet connectivity to their existing products.Mr. Son said he intended to double the number of employees at ARM in the next five years, and he said he would make that pledge a legally binding commitment enforceable by Britain\u2019s takeover panel.SoftBank had been signaling that it was preparing for a major move.Last month, Mr. Son reasserted control over SoftBank\u2019s overseas investment portfolio, easing out a former Google executive whom he had been grooming as his successor. In a statement announcing the departure of the executive, Nikesh Arora, Mr. Son said he had decided to stay on as SoftBank\u2019s chief for at least five or 10 more years.Until now, SoftBank has invested mostly in the services side of the technology business \u2014 internet companies like Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, and mobile phone carriers like Sprint and Vodafone, whose Japanese arm Mr. Son bought in 2006 and turned into one of Japan\u2019s dominant carriers.But abrupt changes in direction are part of SoftBank\u2019s DNA. Mr. Son founded the company in the 1980s as a distributor of computer software. When he broke into the mobile phone market with the Vodafone purchase in 2006, many predicted disaster \u2014 SoftBank lacked experience in the industry, and the $15 billion deal loaded it with debt. But the business, renamed SoftBank Mobile, soon became a cash cow.Raine Group, Robey Warshaw and Mizuho Securities advised SoftBank on the deal, while Lazard and Goldman Sachs advised ARM Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the terms of another large chip deal.

{"Headline": "Reasons to Believe the A.I. Boom Is Real", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byBitsArtificial intelligence is booming. But why now?The movement can be thought of as a spread of computing intelligence everywhere, on wheels and wings, in your pocket and all through your house. That\u2019s a big enough idea to fund scores of companies, and quite possibly set up the next Silicon Valley boom. And bubble.Yet it\u2019s worth asking how much of this is reality and how much is wishful thinking. Why is A.I. growing the way it didn\u2019t over the last several decades, despite promises that it would?The answer to that lies in the precursors to this A.I. moment, which more than anything has to do with the Google-led search boom 10 years ago.In 2006, Google and Yahoo released new methods of analyzing the quirky real-world data they were picking up from doing search. Data from browsers can be thought of as a proxy for human behavior, as people wander the web. It\u2019s typically called \u201cunstructured\u201d data, as opposed to the more regular information of things like banking and airline schedules that filled most of the world\u2019s databases.That new way of seeing the real world helped make search profitable and also enabled companies like Facebook to look into even stranger social behavior. The success also gave these companies plenty of money to plow into the problem.To money, and the first ever caches of natural behavior in digital form, add cheaper computing. In 2006, Amazon also introduced its cloud-computing business. Over the last decade, retail cloud computing has become an inexpensive way for lots of people to work on data analysis and pattern finding, the heart of A.I.Only one more thing was needed, and in 2007 Apple came out with the iPhone. Let that stand for browser-type natural data collection moving off desktops and blowing through the natural world. Along with other cheap sensors tied to the cloud, it has given us huge amounts of data about all sorts of things.That created many more places where computers could do what they\u2019ve always done, which is to seek efficiency. That has created a cycle:more observation, more machine learning of patterns, more value capture funding more observation.It\u2019s enough to make you believe in this boom.What could make you believe it\u2019s also a bubble? Start with the name, artificial intelligence. So far there is zero evidence we will be about to build machines that possess intelligence or will really think on their own. If big money goes into that stuff, run for the hills.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Get the Epidural", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionI AM seven months pregnant and standing in line at a grocery store in Brooklyn, minding my own business (as much as anyone pregnant can mind her own business, because people constantly feel as if they have the right to talk to pregnant women about their pregnancy). A woman in front of me turns around. She\u2019s a little younger than me. She does not appear pregnant. She is not with kids. Maybe she has kids at home. It doesn\u2019t really matter.She asks me, \u201cWhen are you due?\u201dThis is a common question and one I don\u2019t mind answering.I tell her. I assume we are done.But then, she says, \u201cAre you having a natural birth?\u201dI\u2019m just trying to buy a sandwich. Is this complete stranger really asking about my birth plans? I decide to be honest.\u201cNo,\u201d I reply with a smile.She looks at me, worried. \u201cSo you\u2019re having an epidural?\u201dI am beside myself.Now she looks genuinely shocked. She turns and scurries away, like a missionary who\u2019s just been told by a particularly stubborn native that she\u2019s very excited to go directly to pagan hell.I have thought about this conversation often. It annoyed me the rest of that day, and many days after, and recalling it now, I\u2019m annoyed again. I just had to eat a cookie to stop being annoyed. At the center of this interaction is one of the key little acorns of nonsense that perpetuates this guilt over pain relief during childbirth.\u201cNatural.\u201d It sounds so \u2026 natural. So relaxing. So earth goddess. So feminine.But how often do people really want women to be or do anything \u201cnatural\u201d? It seems to me the answer is almost never. In fact, almost everything natural about women is considered pretty horrific. Hairy legs and armpits? Please shave, you furry beast. Do you have hips and cellulite? Please go hide in the very back of your shoe closet and turn the light off and stay there until someone tells you to come out. (No one will tell you to come out.)It\u2019s interesting that no one cares very much about women doing anything \u201cnaturally\u201d until it involves their being in excruciating pain.No one ever asks a man if he\u2019s having a \u201cnatural root canal.\u201d No one ever asks if a man is having a \u201cnatural vasectomy.\u201dThis is why I generally believe, and of course I know there are exceptions, but I\u2019m just saying, usually, you should get the epidural.The criterion for whether we are doing our jobs as women \u201ccorrectly\u201d\u2014 and, yes, it\u2019s a job \u2014 is more often than not how many of our own wants and needs we are putting aside. We want to eat, but since everyone likes us better when our weight is the same number as our body temperature, we must learn to be hungry. And we can\u2019t acknowledge we\u2019re hungry, because no one wants to think about skinniness as something that takes work. This is why half the ing\u00e9nues on the Oscars red carpet feel compelled to say they just scarfed down a cheeseburger on the way to the show.Weight is just one slice of the pie chart (remember, don\u2019t eat pie) where women are supposed to shun their desires for the satisfaction of everyone around us. The expectation of sacrifice \u2014 regarding sex, childbirth, career, the caretaking of children and aging parents \u2014 is the axis around which so many women\u2019s lives revolve. Men, of course, face pressure around standards of masculinity, but there is not the same jeweler\u2019s loupe scrutiny over every bodily centimeter, and every one of their life decisions.Which brings us back to why you should get the epidural.\u201cBut what about the science?\u201d some women (and many men) will say. \u201cThere is science showing all the risks of an epidural!\u201d Well, again, I am not a doctor, but I do have the internet. And I\u2019ve Googled the pros and cons extensively, which is very close to what a doctor would do.According to my research, there are some small risks: A tiny percentage of women experience a severe headache. Headaches aren\u2019t great, but I was already getting a headache just thinking about giving birth without an epidural. Your blood pressure might drop, but they monitor that. There are scarier complications \u2014 for example, you might end up needing an emergency C-section \u2014 but you might end up needing one if you try to give birth naturally. Some doctors say epidurals slow labor down, but I spoke to doctors who believe it can actually speed it up. And there is plenty of science saying epidurals are overwhelmingly safe, as well.There are so many debates in this life in which there is some evidence of one thing and also some evidence of the other. At such a point, you just have to decide to believe in and do what is best for you. So here\u2019s a radical idea: Why not do the thing that makes you happy? You probably already see the wisdom of this philosophy in other areas of your life. For instance: I have never met Oprah, but I believe it to be no less than a fact that if we met we would become best friends. It\u2019s possible this isn\u2019t true, but I am a happier person believing that it is. (It\u2019s definitely true.)Shortly before my son was born, I spoke to a friend on the phone about how guilty I felt that we were planning to hire a night nurse for a few weeks. Shouldn\u2019t I be the one to take care of him all the time? He was my peanut that I had created. Wouldn\u2019t I be shirking my maternal responsibilities if I didn\u2019t stay up around the clock? I was worried that I was already a failure.At which point my friend said, \u201cWhat are you trying to win?\u201dThere is so much pressure on women around birth and labor and mothering to do it this way or that way. It\u2019s so easy to believe the notion that having a baby demands complete and total self-abnegation, and anything short of that is not enough.But here\u2019s the thing: If you\u2019re worried that skipping the pain of childbirth means you\u2019re somehow cheating your baby, or yourself, you\u2019re not. Because the truth is, life offers more than enough pain that you will not be able to skip. By the time you\u2019ve had a kid, you\u2019ve probably been through some of it already. The pain of breakups. The pain of rejection. The pain of being picked last for a team. The pain of hearing your parents fighting in the other room.When you have a baby, there will be plenty more pain. The pain of recovery, no matter how you give birth. The pain of nursing. The pain of not fitting into any of your old clothes. The pain of not fitting into even your maternity jeans. The pain of hearing your baby cry and not knowing how to fix it. The pain of wondering whether your partner still finds you attractive. The pain of arguing with your husband while your child is in the other room. The pain of knowing that you witnessed the very first moment of this beautiful person\u2019s life, and that one day, and you hope that it\u2019s at least a hundred years from now, there will inevitably be a last moment.So really, get the epidural.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Clamps Down on Online News Reporting", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China has ordered several of the country\u2019s most popular internet portals to halt much of their original news reporting, in a move that could confine an even larger share of the journalism in the country to Communist-controlled mouthpieces ahead of an important party meeting next year.The profit-driven portals, several of which are listed on United States stock exchanges, have in recent years expanded their investigative teams to increase readership among China\u2019s more than 600 million internet users by scooping the staid state-owned news media on stories about subjects including industrial pollution, tainted milk powder and even police brutality.The edict made public on Monday, which said the web portals were in \u201cserious violation\u201d of a 2005 internet regulation, came before a meeting next year of the Communist Party Congress. The party often puts in place controls on news before important events, such as the party conclave, held once every five years, which will pick a new group of senior leaders.The news sites are run by China\u2019s biggest internet companies, which also operate social media platforms and produce some of the country\u2019s most popular online games. Sina, which runs a news aggregation service and publishes original reporting, also created Weibo, China\u2019s popular Twitter-like social media site. The companies are roughly the equivalent of the United States\u2019 largest internet companies, like Facebook, Twitter and Google, and their news sites combine articles from other outlets with original reporting and investigative journalism.Wen Tao, who until last year was a reporter for \u201cSerious Reporting\u201d at Phoenix, one of the news features shut down by the new edict, said by telephone that in recent years the news portals had played a cat-and-mouse game with government internet censors, pushing the boundaries of censorship by publishing material without submitting it for approval and waiting to see if it was taken down by the authorities.But Mr. Wen said that even in China, with its notorious army of censors, it was difficult for the government to control news in a market powered by hundreds of millions of readers hungry for news that goes beyond Communist propaganda.\u201cThe flow of information cannot be stopped \u2014 it\u2019s like a flood,\u201d Mr. Wen said. \u201cYou either need to discharge it or it will run rampant.

Whatever it is.So that\u2019s my first takeaway \u2014 losing yourself in true-crime stories is like the ritualistic folk magic practiced by shamans, witches and superstitious grandmothers. And it\u2019s considerably more sanitary than spitting through your fingers to keep the demons down in hell where they belong.The case that captured Renner\u2019s imagination was a poser, all right. Maura Murray, a nursing student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (once considered \u201cthe most violent campus in the country\u201d), drove her car into a snowbank in the winter of 2004. But when the police arrived on the scene only minutes after the crash, Maura had vanished. Drawing on published accounts, social media and his own nose for news, Renner gradually divulges odd bits of information about Maura and members of her family. (Not to give anything away, but this wasn\u2019t the first time she had wrecked a car.)Renner, the author of \u201cThe Serial Killer\u2019s Apprentice,\u201d is just plain fun to read. Noting that Maura lived in Melville Hall, he can\u2019t resist mentioning that this freshman dormitory took its name from \u201cthe guy who wrote the ultimate book on pointless obsession.\u201d He\u2019s also shamelessly entertaining on how he happened to do a brief but humiliating stint in jail for assaulting a police officer. And while his chronicle of the ups and downs of his own messy life brings no insights to the still-unsolved mystery of Maura Murray\u2019s disappearance, it does give us a clue to how inquisitive armchair detectives can turn into excitable children when they get carried away playing with their toys.Di Maio\u2019s first important case after he joined the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Maryland in 1969 involved the unexplainable seizures of the children of the Army sergeant Harry Woods and his wife, Martha. One of the children, 7-month-old Paul, died. (Over a 23-year period, seven of the babies in Martha Woods\u2019s care died, and five were touch-and-go.) The psychological disorder of Munchausen syndrome by proxy wasn\u2019t defined until the late 1970s, Di Maio says, and \u201cserial killer\u201d didn\u2019t become a common term until the 1980s. But this seminal case helped start the dialogue.To satisfy \u201cCSI\u201d fans hungry for technical details about the decomposition of the human body, Di Maio obliges with some vividly depicted exhumations. He also offers a grim scientific explanation for why so-called satanic ritual cult murders are a lot of hooey, existing \u201conly in the movies, on the internet and in paranoid dreams.\u201d In a flourish of a finish, he even advances the theory that van Gogh\u2019s famous suicide may have been a homicide.Working from exhaustively researched archival material, she delivers the requisite case histories about infamous lady poisoners. There was Eliza Fenning, a pretty young cook who went to the gallows for serving her master and his family a heaping plate of arsenic-laced \u00addumplings. (The overworked servant probably just wanted to give them indigestion.) In another scandalous case, Madeleine Smith, who came from a wealthy family in Glasgow, was said to have dispatched her secret lover with a helping of arsenic when she received a more attractive marriage proposal. Anne Barry was a sadder case. The devoted charwoman for a shopkeeper who made a habit of sexually assaulting his young female customers, Anne delivered the poison that killed the newborn daughter of a 17-year-old girl who had been raped by Anne\u2019s employer. She was hanged for her complicity; happily, so was he.Although Stratmann\u2019s academic narrative style is on the dry side, there\u2019s fire in her sociological thesis that poison murder was a \u201csecret\u201d crime, the chosen method of voiceless women, children and servants \u2014 those who had no legal power within the Victorian patriarchal system. The political and social establishment considered poisoners \u201cthe worst kind of criminals\u201d because they directly \u201cthreatened the established order of society.\u201d It seemed that no cheating husband, abusive master or inconvenient infant was safe from a desperate woman. But once women\u2019s marital rights were expanded (in, for example, the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1870) and labor reforms extended to children, who worked long hours in mines, factories and sweatshops, the image of \u201cthe archetypical female poisoner who operated in an impoverished domestic setting\u201d gave way to a new image of \u201cthe educated middle-class male\u201d \u2014 a \u201cgentleman\u201d who, it should be noted, was more likely to murder for profit than from the pain and passion that motivated women.\u201cThe people had elected one of their own as their secular saint,\u201d Murphy writes, \u201cas a martyr for their age and their condition.\u201d But the popular press that spoke for the upper classes was having none of it. \u201cThere are among us,\u201d one newspaper editorial ran, \u201clarge numbers of men and women who have an unmistakable craving for this sort of ghastly stimulus.\u201dAlthough Murphy, the author of \u201cShooting Victoria,\u201d is mainly interested in the advances of forensic science, his lively narrative, with its unambiguous tone of outrage, is also a takedown of the social system. \u201cHe was the young master,\u201d Murphy notes. \u201cShe was his servant, and she had served him as innumerable young female servants had served innumerable young masters in the past.\u201d Sure enough, the hierarchy prevailed. Edmund was acquitted of murder, and his debased victim found no justice. (It was left to Jane\u2019s friends to affirm her \u201chuman value\u201d on her tombstone.)There were enticing things to see and do in and around London in the summer of 1895 \u2014 cricket matches in St. John\u2019s Wood, a melodrama at the Theater Royal, excursions to the seaside town of Southend \u2014 and 13-year-old Robert Coombes and his 12-year-old brother, Nathaniel, wanted to see and do it all. And they would, with the assistance of a grown-up, their honest if slow-witted babysitter, John Fox. But first, Robert had to kill the boys\u2019 mother.Through a combination of cunning (Robert\u2019s) and innocence (Fox\u2019s), the decomposing body of Emily Coombes went undetected in her bedroom for several days. (Both boys and the nasally challenged Fox spent their nights in a downstairs room.) During the day, Robert sent Fox about the city to finance their excursions by selling various household items. Eventually, Emily\u2019s body was discovered by concerned relatives who insisted on being let inside the house. (It was his own aunt who called Robert \u201ca bad, wicked boy.\u201d) Because there was no court for young defendants, the brothers were tried as adults. Nathaniel struck a plea deal, but Robert was convicted and sent to the Broadmoor asylum, where he remained for the next 17 years. And there, you might think, the story would end.But Summerscale has barely started, intent as she is on bringing some insight into Robert\u2019s behavior and eviscerating the criminal justice system for pouncing on him as if he were some depraved fiend. Over the course of her irresistible book, she takes on popular attitudes toward children and their place in society. \u201cThe child is, naturally, by his organization, nearer to the animal, to the savage, to the criminal, than the adult,\u201d Havelock Ellis wrote in 1890, reflecting a popular belief of the day. To subdue their savage minds, the jury called for a ban on penny dreadfuls, the \u201cinflammable and shocking literature\u201d that inflamed Robert\u2019s over\u00addeveloped imagination. Summerscale proves a wonderful champion of these exciting adventure tales, which allowed young boys to dream of better things than a life of poverty.With Robert serving as scapegoat, the defenders of England\u2019s crumbling system of morality went so far as to demand a recall of the Education Act of 1870. There were four and a half million children in school in 1892, which sober minds knew would lead only to \u201cambition, restlessness, defiance, a spirit of insurgency.\u201d The boys\u2019 own father, who had been away at sea during the tragedy, damned Robert for his very intelligence. \u201cThe boy was afflicted with a preponderance of brain matter,\u201d the father offered at the trial. \u201cHe had too much brain tissue for the size of the skull.\u201dThe notion that too much imagination is dangerous hardly died out with the end of the Victorian age. But the lovely irony of Robert\u2019s story is that, when he was finally released from prison, he became a hero like the protagonists of his beloved penny dreadfuls and went on to live the adventurous life he had dreamed of.Marilyn Stasio writes the Crime column for the Book Review.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Moves One Step Closer to Light-Based Wireless Communication", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byTrilobitesThe internet is often called the \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d but it\u2019s not actually accessible to residents of a large portion of the world. Today, four billion people are offline, and 1.6 billion of them live in sparsely populated areas around the world.Most internet signals today are transmitted at high rates through wired optical fiber networks \u2014 which require expensive infrastructure \u2014 or at lower rates through wireless radio frequencies, which are limited in bandwidth, subject to regulations and vulnerable to interception.Free-space optical communication works by encoding communication signals in laser beams. Transmitters on the ground or in satellites shoot that light through the air to receivers that can decode the data. (To understand this on simple terms, think of encoding and sending information through morse code using a flashlight.)One longstanding obstacle to free-space optical communication is a trade-off between speed and size. To increase the number of laser signals hitting a receiver, one can increase the size of the receiver. But doing so makes the receiver slower.Instead, many free-space optical communication systems use smaller receivers with complex pointing and tracking systems. Because laser beams are narrow and travel in straight lines from point A to point B, these receivers have to continuously maneuver to catch laser beams head-on.The Facebook researchers\u2019 solution to this problem is a light detector that doesn\u2019t need pointing and tracking, but still allows for fast transmission. To do this, they took advantage of fluorescence, the process of absorbing light and re-emitting it at a lower energy.Facebook\u2019s detector contains a spherical bundle of special fluorescent fibers. The bundle, somewhere between the size of a golf ball and tennis ball, is able to absorb blue laser light from any direction and re-emit it as green light. Because that green light is diffuse, it can then be funneled to a small receiver that converts the light back to data.In our hypothetical example, imagine that instead of a water gun, you\u2019re pointing a blow dart gun at a water balloon attached to a funnel over the potted plant. As soon as you hit the balloon, it pops and releases water. With the addition of the balloon, you\u2019ve eliminated the need to move the pot around. You can shoot at the water balloon from any direction, and the plant will get watered.Facebook\u2019s new detector is able to achieve fast data rates of two gigabits per second \u2014 several orders of magnitude higher than those from radio frequencies \u2014 because light has a higher frequency than radio waves, and because the fluorescence process is fast. Free-space optical communication can also carry more information than radio communication, and is more secure because narrow laser beams are harder to intercept than wide radio waves.For now, the new light detector is still in early stages, said Tobias Tiecke, a communication systems scientist at Facebook and a co-author of the new paper. His team built their current device using off-the-shelf materials that are used for harvesting solar light.\u201cThe performance of our system can still be increased much further by developing materials tailored for communication,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Dennis Crowley, co-founder and chairman of Foursquare, recently discussed the Pok\u00e9mon Go phenomenon and how Foursquare was early to location-based services. The interview has been edited and condensed:Pok\u00e9mon Go seemed to take everyone by surprise. Did the fast uptake surprise you?I thought it was interesting that it\u2019s a location-based game. It\u2019s really the first time since the original Foursquare came out in 2009 that a location-based game has really captured pop culture\u2019s attention.I\u2019ve been working in this space for a while. To see a lot of those ideas make it into something like Pok\u00e9mon, I just sit back and think that it\u2019s awesome.Did Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s fast rise frustrate you at all? Another company nailed something quickly that you guys have been trying to do for years.It\u2019s the opposite of frustration. We started working on this stuff in graduate school, and now it\u2019s exciting to see others pay attention to it. To see this succeed at this level, I think it\u2019s validating for everyone playing in the location-based gaming space for years. It\u2019s a piece of software that changes people\u2019s behavior in the real world.Have you seen any halo effects on Foursquare\u2019s business?I think we\u2019ve been beating this drum for a while. Location services are going to power everything in the future. They\u2019re going to be involved in everything we touch.One of the most interesting things is that it raises people\u2019s awareness that the game board overlaps with the real world.Developers are saying, \u201cHow do we build the next Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d The wealth of data we\u2019ve captured over the past six years, we can help be a part of that.I think what happens with Pok\u00e9mon is that people start realizing that they can use it to advertise their business, a light bulb will really go off and you\u2019ll see far more of it.It\u2019s not just an ad, it\u2019s a much more creative ad. This is what ad agencies do \u2014 they dream up crazy ideas. Now we\u2019re starting to have these conversations with them, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve built this thing. We can make something magical happen when you and your phone walk into a Starbucks, or a baseball stadium. If that\u2019s something you want to build, that\u2019s something Foursquare can power.\u201dHow many stand-alone start-ups can really do this stuff? I think it\u2019s like a \u201ccount on one hand\u201d type of thing. Google, Apple, Ingress data owned by Niantic. Our data set is 85 million places. We know latitude and longitude, but we also understand your relationship to where you\u2019re positioned when you move in, out and around those places.If Foursquare is in a strategically advantageous place after the explosion of Pok\u00e9mon, does it make sense to be a stand-alone company? Would you field acquisition offers?We always have those types of conversations as they come up, and frankly a few more have occurred in the days since Pok\u00e9mon Go came out.That said, Foursquare is a real business now. We\u2019re in a good spot where we can continue to exist and do what we\u2019re doing for the long haul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Faces New Round of Antitrust Charges in Europe", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byWhen it comes to Europe\u2019s lengthy investigations into Google, Margrethe Vestager, the region\u2019s competition chief, is hoping that the third time\u2019s a charm.\u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct, based on our evidence, is harmful to consumers,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. \u201cGoogle\u2019s magnificent innovations don\u2019t give it the right to deny competitors the chance to innovate.\u201dThe stakes are high. Google could face fines of up to 10 percent, or about $7 billion, of its global annual revenue if it is found to have broken Europe\u2019s tough competition rules.Google said in a statement on Thursday that it would provide a detailed response to Europe\u2019s latest charges, but it added, \u201cWe believe our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for E.U. consumers and promote competition.\u201d The company has until the fall to respond.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Europe\u2019s new antitrust charges represent a further ratcheting up of the region\u2019s often frosty relationship with Google.In particular, European antitrust officials are taking aim at some of the company\u2019s online advertising tools \u2014 the main engine for Google\u2019s $75 billion in annual revenue. They say that the company may have abused its dominant market position when offering some of its search products on third-party companies\u2019 websites.These businesses \u2014 including publishers and online retailers \u2014 can use Google\u2019s search engine on their sites so that people can find information like newspaper articles or promotions. Such agreements with third-party companies, which date to 2006, also include showing paid-for advertising next to search results, often provided by Google.Ms. Vestager said on Thursday that the technology company may have abused its dominance \u2014 it holds roughly an 80 percent market share in this type of niche on-site search \u2014 by forcing companies to sign onerous contracts that limited competition and reduced consumer choice.Since 2009, Google has made it easier for advertising rivals to show their offerings alongside its services. But Europe\u2019s competition chief said that Google still required third-party companies to show a minimum number of Google-provided ads on their site. The Silicon Valley company also requires businesses using the service to ask for approval on where some rivals\u2019 ads may be shown on their websites.\u201cAll these restrictions allowed Google to protect its market share and stifle competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Europe\u2019s antitrust authorities have also doubled down on a previous competition charge, announced last year, which claimed that Google had diverted traffic from competitors in favor of its own comparison-shopping site. On Thursday, Ms. Vestager said her team had found new evidence to buttress their claims, adding that because of Google\u2019s actions, European consumers may not have access to the most relevant search results when looking online for goods and services.Yet when asked about the failure of European antitrust authorities to order fines or changes to the way Google does business, despite several years of investigations, Ms. Vestager said she aimed to ensure the charges against the company stood up in European courts.\u201cSpeed is of the essence,\u201d but \u201cthe other side of that coin is quality,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Thursday. \u201cSometimes that kind of quality comes at the cost of speed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 4", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementPHILADELPHIA \u2014 To hear her daughter, to watch a video about her life and to listen to her own words, it was hard to believe that a significant majority of Americans hold a negative view of Hillary Clinton, finding her untrustworthy and dishonest. How could that be true of such a devoted mother, such an exuberant grandmother and such a champion of the underprivileged, with such a big, ready laugh? Do we know her at all? Have we gotten her entirely wrong?The party was making history with a female nominee, and it rightly and fully celebrated that, imagining a woman in the American presidency for the first time, after all this time. \u201cWhen any barrier falls in America,\u201d Clinton said in her speech, \u201cit clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201dBut this particular woman needed to be humanized, softened. In order to touch the sky, she had to reach out as never before. Her story had to be transformed from one of unquenchable ambition to one of boundless heart, and the urgency of the task was underscored by the attention to detail with which she and her campaign team went about it.That video, shown just before Clinton took the stage, was produced by Shonda Rhimes. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman. He concluded by telling Americans that \u201cthis is the woman.\u201dThen Clinton appeared, to music with these lyrics: \u201cThis is my fight song, take-back-my-life song.\u201dShe was taking back her life in order to claim her desired future.\u201cSometimes, the people at this podium are new to the national stage,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you know, I\u2019m not one of those people.\u201d Then she gave a quick recitation of her resume.\u201cBut my job titles only tell you what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part. I get it that some people just don\u2019t know what to make of me.\u201dIt was an extraordinary admission for someone who\u2019s been in the public eye for a quarter century. It was also a necessary one. And it spoke to one of the many oddities of this transcendently odd election. Perhaps the most familiar person ever to run for the White House must use the process to introduce herself \u2014 or, rather, re-re-reintroduce herself \u2014 to voters.In any other year, with any other matchup, that might be politically fatal. I don\u2019t think it will be for Clinton, and her speech, like much of the convention, showed why. The case against Donald Trump is a damning one, and she and other Democrats know how to make it, presenting him as someone who will threaten our national security and throw our most cherished values in the trash, someone of inadequate preparation and an undetectable soul.\u201cA man you can bait with a Tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,\u201d Clinton said at one point, to a roar from the crowd.\u201cFor the past year,\u201d she later added, \u201cmany people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They thought he couldn\u2019t possibly mean all the horrible things he says, like when he called women \u2018pigs.\u2019 Or said that an American judge couldn\u2019t be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.\u201d She gave additional examples from the seemingly endless list.Her speech wasn\u2019t a memorable one. It was too much of a laundry list, with too little shape and a delivery that was rushed and mechanical at times. But it was full of terrific lines, and the crowd went wild when she acknowledged the milestone of her nomination, saying: \u201cStanding here as my mother\u2019s daughter, and my daughter\u2019s mother, I\u2019m so happy this day has come. I\u2019m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.\u201dBut the yardstick for her wasn\u2019t really any of those more polished or accessible orators. Nor was it Trump, whose own big convention speech presented the peculiar vision of an even more peculiar candidate not readily comparable to anyone else.The yardstick for Clinton was Clinton herself \u2014 and her tendency to come across as programmed, guarded, remote. If many Americans look askance at her, it\u2019s not just because Republicans have so persistently encouraged them to. It\u2019s because she can seem so far away, on the opposite side of a moat that she dug herself and has little interest in letting people traverse.She got only part of the way there, but that distance was crucial and could well be enough. She shared tales \u2014 carefully selected, of course \u2014 about her grandfather, her father and her mother, who, she recounted, \u201cwas abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.\u201dMothers and daughters and children in general: Clinton and the people who talked about her kept coming back to that, and while the intent was obvious \u2014 to communicate that she wasn\u2019t all stiffness and steel \u2014 the tactic verged on overkill and was a discouraging confirmation of sexist double standards.A man doesn\u2019t have to prove first that he\u2019s been a model father to be allowed to ascend to the pinnacle of his career. But apparently a woman has to show that she hasn\u2019t shortchanged motherhood in order to get the green light.Her conduct as a mother is seen as a window into her character, and she can\u2019t possibly be a warm person unless she\u2019s been a warm parent. That was the context for much of Bill Clinton\u2019s tribute to Hillary and for almost all of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s.Chelsea introduced Hillary as a grandmother who will drop everything on her way to a speech or a debate and use FaceTime \u201cfor a few minutes of blowing kisses and reading \u2018Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo\u2019 with her granddaughter.\u201d She said that Hillary faithfully attended her soccer games and music recitals.\u201cThoughtful,\u201d she called her. \u201cHilarious.\u201dI\u2019ll be fascinated to see what kind of bounce Hillary gets in the polls. I predict that it will be a big one, not because Americans suddenly see her in a wholly new light but because the Democrats\u2019 gathering here was everything that the Republicans\u2019 in Cleveland was not: coherently choreographed, packed full of emotional highlights, packed even fuller with the party\u2019s most respected leaders, and consistent in its messaging about Trump, which was lethal.He looked toward the cameras and addressed Trump directly: \u201cLet me ask you, have you even read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy.\u201d He held it in its hand.That\u2019s the kind of question and gesture that should doom Trump and likely will. Warm or cold, accessible or aloof, Clinton is smart enough to take advantage of that.Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.On social media over the past two weeks, each party\u2019s convention generated impressive entries in what became a massively multiplayer game of digital \u201cdozens\u201d \u2014 a battle to insult, nickname, meme, gif and hashtag both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. On Twitter, one measure of the success of a convention speech was how quickly a succinct phrase from it appeared and proliferated. Throughout the Democratic National Convention, three-word slogans proved especially suitable for hashtags. Barack Obama reprised \u201cdon\u2019t boo, vote\u201d (for delegates who jeered mention of Mr. Trump), while Senator Tim Kaine landed on \u201cnot one word\u201d (for the number of believable words spoken by Mr. Trump). Mr. Kaine had another winner with \u201csi se puede,\u201d the Spanish twist on Mr. Obama\u2019s original \u201cYes, we can.\u201d @CharlesLandy cheered Mr. Kaine\u2019s hashtag prowess, tweeting that he was \u201cCRUSHING this\u201d by \u201cmaking trending hashtags with every sentence.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden nailed \u201cnot a clue\u201d (for Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the middle class), which, together with Mr. Kaine\u2019s #notoneword, made one-two punch attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s ignorance and mendacity. The Clinton campaign, of course, had seeded the hashtags #imwithher, #dealusin and #lovetrumpshate, and when Senator Al Franken and the actresses Lena Dunham and America Ferrera used the campaign slogans, Twitter dutifully echoed them. Last week, the Republican National Convention had a hit with #lockherup, a vigilante cry that sounded in the arena and then played brilliantly on Twitter, even during the Democratic National Convention\u2019s broadcast last night. A subplot emerged, however, when the concerted effort to get the hashtag to \u201ctrend\u201d led to conspiracy musings about how Twitter might have hidden its popularity. A tweeter called @Lion_PartyUSA asked why #lockherup wasn\u2019t trending, concluding, \u201cI hope WikiLeaks builds an alternative.\u201d A WikiLeaks Twitter? Interesting idea. When speakers and candidates work backward from Twitter\u2019s conventions and space constraints to build phrases aimed to trend as hashtags, it\u2019s clear that the medium is profoundly shaping the message. However, as Mrs. Clinton said last night in what might have been her best line, there\u2019s a time to jump off Twitter, especially when the stakes get high. \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons,\u201d she said, breaking free of hashtag character constraints. \u201cDon\u2019t tweet, vote,\u201d she might have added. Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of \u201cMagic and Loss: The Internet as Art.\u201dI asked a few Wellesley alumnae and current students how it has felt to see Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ascension in politics, and what this moment means. Here\u2019s what they had to say. Ms. Salomon lived with Mrs. Clinton for three years in college. \u201cI thought she was incredibly warm, amazingly smart, directed, caring about the people around her and her friends. She\u2019s one of the most loyal people I\u2019ve met,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me very sad that she comes across \u2014 apparently, to many people \u2014 as being cold, reserved, calculating. She\u2019s so warm and caring.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is one of the most exciting moments in my whole life.\u201d Ms. Hill was involved in student government at Wellesley with Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Hill said she had some \u201cadjustment problems\u201d when she entered Wellesley in 1965, as a black woman coming from a segregated upbringing in New Orleans. Mrs. Clinton was one of the first white people she\u2019d met, Ms. Hill said. She said she wanted to drop out of college after the first few days, but her mother and Mrs. Clinton both encouraged her to stay. Her son is now working for the Clinton campaign in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s sobering to know that a person I\u2019ve known 51 years and who\u2019s always been a friend and been supportive of me and my family and someone to look up to is going to become the president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019m thrilled for her, but I\u2019m thrilled for the country.\u201d Ms. Ross-Dolen said she decided to run to be a delegate in Ohio\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, despite having no previous political experience. \u201cIt is a thrill to take part in the political process in order to propel Hillary to victory and make history,\u201d Ms. Ross-Dolen wrote over email. Ms. Sjogren, a rising junior, works for the Wellesley Students for Hillary group and said she was \u201cecstatic that Hillary will be president.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand exactly how big of a deal a major party nominating their first woman presidential candidate is. Unlike Hillary and unlike my grandmothers, I didn\u2019t grow up in a world that told me that I couldn\u2019t because I was a girl,\u201d she said. \u201cUnlike every American woman who never got to see last night, I never doubted the possibility of a female president.\u201d \nLauren Tamaki is live-illustrating the speech, with your input.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 \u201cWe elect presidents in Iowa,\u201d said Ora McQueen. A 72-year-old Hillary Clinton delegate, Ms. McQueen noted that President Obama had carried Iowa twice. Mrs. Clinton barely eked out a win over Bernie Sanders there in January. \u201cThere\u2019s good buzz in Iowa for our girl,\u201d said Tara McNulty, a Clinton delegate, before the day\u2019s convention proceedings began. Still, she said, \u201csome people think she\u2019s too reserved.\u201d \u201cA lot of people feel like she\u2019s a robot,\u201d said Corey Jones, a 19-year-old Sanders delegate. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s human.\u201d One solution, he said, was to show more emotion: \u201cI think if she cried onstage, that would help a lot.\u201d Ms. McNulty thinks Mrs. Clinton needs to spend more face-to-face time with Iowa voters to counter the perception that she\u2019s unapproachable and to win the state in November. Ms. McQueen, too, wants Mrs. Clinton to spend more time in Iowa. In particular, she said, \u201cI want to see Hillary continue addressing the women.\u201d Working in the male-dominated field of corrections, Ms. McQueen has seen many men she trained advance to executive positions, so equal pay for women is a key issue for her. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength on wage equality helped Ms. McQueen make the decision to support her. Aside from appealing to voters with sound proposals, Mrs. Clinton also has to manage sometimes-conflicting expectations that her male opponents \u2014 first Mr. Sanders, now Donald Trump \u2014 haven\u2019t had to reckon with. As Mr. Jones put it, \u201cbeing a woman in politics, she has to be tough, she has to be emotionless.\u201d \u201cShe has to put on that barrier,\u201d he explained, but \u201cif she doesn\u2019t break that barrier, then we won\u2019t really know who she is.\u201d PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The historian Annette Gordon-Reed said recently that she thinks it was easier for a black man to win the presidency than it will be for a white woman. It was Ms. Gordon-Reed\u2019s research that erased any doubt that Thomas Jefferson was the father of the children of his slave Sally Hemings. Her magisterial book, \u201cThe Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2009 and made her the first African-American woman to win that prize. Of course, that was also the year Barack Obama became the first black president of the United States. Ms. Gordon-Reed believes it was easier for Mr. Obama to become the first black president than it will be for Hillary Clinton to become the first female one. She said that she didn\u2019t think when the book was published in 2008 \u201cthere was any doubt about who most black people were going to vote for. But the gender thing is different. You can never get women to vote as a monolith \u2014 this is a deep cultural thing. \u201cBlack men got the vote before women, which caused great dissension. Feminists supported abolition, but didn\u2019t get the vote.\u201d For female candidates, she said: \u201cIf you\u2019re too motherly that\u2019s a problem, if you\u2019re too young or sexual or pretty that\u2019s a problem. Getting there, persuading people to love you, to trust you \u2014 how does a woman do that across a wide swath of the nation?\u201d Political analysts once thought a black presidential candidate would face a comparable, complicated challenge: For example, some thought that the first black president had to be a Republican, like Colin Powell. But along came Barack Obama, whose win blew away those notions \u2014 and suggested that Americans were more ready to embrace a minority president than a female one. Now Mrs. Clinton is pitted against Donald Trump, a candidate who has a record of insulting women. Her candidacy, Ms. Gordon-Reed says, \u201cis a test of the character of the American people. She should not underestimate the power of the forces aligned with Trump. She should continue to run an inclusive campaign, tell people what she\u2019s for and focus on the positive things rather than trying to out-negative him.\u201d Convincing people to vote out of optimism, rather than fear, she said, was what John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were about, as was Bill Clinton in the 1990s. \u201cJefferson said you should not try to change people\u2019s beliefs about things, because it will harden them in their stance. You\u2019re better off sticking to your story, and maybe, in the fullness of time, people will be persuaded.\u201d The Trump campaign has famously been understaffed. Still, might there possibly be a senior \u2026 handler whose sole duty each night is to snatch the Republican nominee\u2019s cellphone at the sign of his Twitter fingers twitching? Someone to intervene before he goes digitally nuclear? Because he\u2019s been known to do that. Day 1, after the Bernie Sanders delegate mutiny was subdued, Trump tweeted a few fistfuls of salt to rub in the wounds. (\u201cSad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution \u2026 totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d) Mid-evening, he went all mean girl on Elizabeth Warren: \u201cPocahontas \u2026 spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated.\u201d Then silence, of an ominous sort. Could he possibly have been as mesmerized by Michelle Obama as the crowd inside the Wells Fargo Center? Almost an hour elapsed. Even when Mrs. Obama took dead aim, \u201cThe issues a president faces are not black and white, and cannot be boiled down into 140 characters\u201d \u2014 still nothing. I envisioned him sequestered in Trump Tower, handcuffed to the arms of his faux Louis XIV ormolu throne. (\u201cFor your own safety, Mr. Trump,\u201d the handler whispered.) The cuffs finally came off, but only for a final swipe at Bernie Sanders. He was done for the night. After a massage and cold-cream application, the handler gave him his silk sleeping gloves. It turned out Mr. Trump was actually in North Carolina, where the following day he told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention audience: \u201cWe will create a private White House hotline to field complaints about the Veterans Administration. This could keep me very busy at night, folks. This could take the place of Twitter.\u201d Though not, nota bene, \u201cso fast your head will spin.\u201d The key word was \u201ccould.\u201d That afternoon, Bernie Sanders, microphone in hand, said, \u201cI move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States.\u201d As the evening proceedings got underway, Mr. Trump struck a Twitter tone more petulant than savage. Unaware that Bill Clinton would be telling an ultimately not-so-shaggy-dog story about a \u201cgirl\u201d he once saw in a library, he pre-emptively reviewed it: \u201cNo matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated.\u201d Anything else? \u201cI hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!\u201d A minority opinion. For the rest of the day his hands were full with the fallout from his invitation to Vladimir Putin to join his cabinet. Which perhaps accounts for his failure to offer any specific critiques of President Obama\u2019s Night 3 valedictory/paean to Hillary Clinton. No matter, other Republicans stepped in. On MSNBC, Nicolle Wallace, a senior adviser to John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign, said: \u201cPresident Obama made the case against Trumpism. He made the definitive case.\u201d Her fellow commentator Steve Schmidt, who was a senior adviser both for Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign and for George W. Bush in 2004, concurred. \u201cA master class in American character,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cHis attacks on Donald Trump from a character basis were shattering.\u201d Many people are Googling for information related to voting. Through the first three days of the Democratic convention, Google searches that include the word \u201cvote\u201d are twice as high as they were during the comparable days of the Republican convention. If you look at all conventions since 2004, the current Democratic convention is generating the second-highest interest in voting, after the 2004 Republican convention. The recent Republican convention generated the second-lowest interest in voting, just beating out the 2012 Republican convention. There is also evidence that the majority of searches for voting during a party\u2019s convention come from supporters. During the recent Republican convention, searches for voting were higher in states that voted Republican in the previous presidential election. Thus far, during the Democratic convention, searches for voting are higher in states that voted Democratic. Of course, for this to truly be good news for Democrats, a large number of the people now motivated to vote will have to successfully pull it off. In the United States, that isn\u2019t so simple. There\u2019s a lot of talk today about how hard it will be for Hillary Clinton to match the rhetorical appeal of President Obama\u2019s speech last night \u2014 the soaring cadences, the patriotic uplift, the defense of American ideals against Donald Trump\u2019s strongman appeal, the deliberate appropriation of \u201cmorning in America\u201d themes from a Republican Party that\u2019s gone way down into the dark.But if Clinton\u2019s eloquence is likely to fall short of the Obama standard, she also has reasons to try something different with her speech anyway, something few speakers at this convention have attempted, and go a little bit into the dark herself.No single theory explains this persistent discontent. There are sociological factors at work: America is an older society than it was in Reagan\u2019s day, a more individualistic and more atomized one, more ideologically polarized and less religious, with more diversity but less solidarity and social trust. There are economic trends: The Obama era, like the Bush era before it, hasn\u2019t generated sustained wage growth even when the unemployment rate is low, creating a feeling of stagnation even in periods of rising gross domestic product.True, electing Trump to deal with these problems seems far more likely hasten any unraveling than to reverse it. But President Obama and his party, in the course of defending his legacy this week, have struggled to acknowledge the legitimacy of American anxiety, the depth of disappointment and discontent.The first three days of this convention have been about stability, continuity, progress, uplift \u2014 all intended to contrast with the reckless and reactionary candidacy of Donald Trump.But to fully deal with her rival\u2019s appeal, Clinton still needs to become, to some degree at least, a candidate for darker times.This year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, however, has not tracked the hero\u2019s journey of the party\u2019s nominee, Hillary Clinton. Perhaps the hero\u2019s journey doesn\u2019t work all that well with female experience. Indeed, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s narrative this week has been that of a nurturer, one who has methodically dedicated herself to recognizing and facilitating the heroism of others \u2014 the handicapped, the kids, the unions, the Mothers of the Movement. Instead, the hero whose journey is being thematized at the engrossing spectacle in Philadelphia is that of the male voter. The voter in conflict. The one who hears the call of Hillary Clinton but refuses it. The one who experiences some supernatural interference in the form of the arch-imago Donald J. Trump. And the one who finally braves, say, another party\u2019s convention or the scorn of his supporters to emerge a changed man, ready to spread the word. It is the story of Bernie Sanders. Man, did Mr. Sanders refuse that Clinton call. Refuse, refuse, refuse \u2014 some heroes do that. But having done battle with his conscience, Mr. Sanders now shows up chivalrically at the convention, day after day, where he sits by his gently encouraging wife, sometimes seeming to brood but also recognizing that this is destiny. And it is the story of Barack Obama. Last night, President Obama was a gracious victor. He is farther along in his hero\u2019s journey than Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Sanders, having won the brass ring himself. In fact, having fought and trounced the Clintons years ago, gallantry now requires that he overcome any last resentments, embrace Mrs. Clinton and become her knight. Then there\u2019s Bill Clinton, who, in speech and demeanor, has looked this week more like a man whose steepest bill has come due than a contented Gandalf. His strangely roundabout formulation about his wife\u2019s sacrifices \u2014 \u201cI really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret\u201d \u2014 was ambivalence itself. But even if it sounded a touch phony and begrudging, he seemed to get it: He has been dodging creditors for a long time and now he is ready to face them. Does jumping into a supporting role as first gentleman \u2014 an inevitably feminized role \u2014 mean that he will have to forfeit his ambitions, his authority, his very virility and life force? Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of \u201cMagic and Loss: The Internet as Art.\u201dVladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea. He threatens the freedom of the Baltic States, which the West struggled to obtain for decades. He rigged elections. He kept Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria while he used chemical weapons against his own people. Putin took over Russia\u2019s fledgling independent media and has been suspected in the murder of journalists. He stole billions for himself and his pals while ordinary Russians struggle to put food on their tables. And what is the assessment of the man who wants to build a wall to keep out impoverished Mexicans but offers open arms to the Russians? Was Trump also being sarcastic last week when he said he would not necessarily come to the aid of countries threatened by Russia, making a mockery of the North Atlantic alliance that has kept the peace in Europe for some 70 years? Trump added, \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe, so you know.\u201d (That, by the way, is an old Kremlin propaganda line that was intended to create a false moral equivalency between the Soviet Union and the United States.) \u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Scarborough said with admirable understatement. \u201cYou obviously condemn Vladimir Putin killing journalists and political opponents, right?\u201d \u201cOh, sure, absolutely,\u201d Trump said. Well, that\u2019s a relief \u2014 unless, of course, he was being \u201csarcastic.\u201d If Trump becomes president, will we constantly have to parse his words to figure out if he\u2019s being sarcastic? I can\u2019t imagine Putin will make the effort. Elizabeth Williamson is a member of the editorial board of The Times.\nCharles Blow was on the convention floor, asking delegates for their opinion.\nThey were mentioned line by line in speeches: unions, especially those for teachers and public employees; environmental groups; workers for reproductive rights, L.G.B.T. rights, civil rights and gun-control laws; campaign-finance reformers; and so forth. Not many of these causes had universal support among elected Democrats, and keeping this coalition of interests intact was the work of the party. When Democratic leaders did their job right, as in the 1990s, this coalition held together. An ideological movement needs a steady diet of enemies and ever bigger promises, whereas interest groups are satisfied with incremental progress and a seat at the table. But the interest-group party had drawbacks, too. It was difficult to present a coherent vision to the many voters who weren\u2019t committed to one particular cause. It neglected dozens of issues, like Wall Street regulation, that had no advocacy groups to counter the interests of campaign donors. Deep structural conflicts, like trade, were often ignored. Racial justice issues were spoken of quietly, as the party struggled to retain its hold on working-class white voters. The phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d would have terrified the Democrats of 1996. The first two days of the Democratic convention felt different, reflecting a long transition that began in the mid-2000s to a more seamless party vision. It started with Howard Dean\u2019s term as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and an effort to build a stronger sense of the party itself, and with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s work, before she was a senator, to call attention to such everyday economic issues as bankruptcy laws. Hillary Clinton\u2019s political lifetime is wholly within the interest-group party, but she has adapted slowly to the more robustly ideological world of this decade, more open to ideas once considered too far left and leery of compromise. But, as the convention is showing, what that means still isn\u2019t quite clear. But other convention speakers, notably Michelle Obama and Senator Cory Booker, showed a different kind of ideology, one that incorporates racial justice, inclusion, tolerance and a commitment to economic justice in a way that doesn\u2019t just check off interest-group boxes. Mr. Booker, for example, laid out a broad agenda of economic and individual justice and yet embedded it in the abstractions of the Declaration of Independence. It\u2019s a new voice for the Democratic Party, not the familiar checklist, not quite Mr. Sanders\u2019s bigger and more confrontational dreams, but also not quite the same as Barack Obama\u2019s frustrated dreams of unity and compromise. The question for the week will be whether Hillary Clinton can master this new voice. Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.She was on her state\u2019s shoreline for Governor\u2019s Bay Day, when there\u2019s free parking at the beaches and free public transportation to them. \u201cThere was a girl there, maybe 8 years old, from Massachusetts,\u201d Raimondo recalled. \u201cHer mom said, \u2018I heard the governor is at this event.\u2019 And the little girl said: \u2018Where is he? I want to see him.\u2019 \u201d Even after all this time, even after so much progress, \u201cWhen you close your eyes and you think \u2018leader,\u2019 you probably picture a man,\u201d Raimondo, 45, observed. The little girl from Massachusetts still did. Little girls from everywhere still do. Raimondo, a Democrat who took office early last year, is Rhode Island\u2019s first female governor. And although Democrats pride themselves on diversity, only two other Democratic governors in America are women. One, Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire, is running for the Senate and will soon exit the governor\u2019s office, to be replaced in all likelihood by a man. The other, Kate Brown, of Oregon, is in a seemingly tight race against a Republican challenger \u2014 male \u2014 and could also be out of office next year. Women have come far, but not all that far, and Raimondo said that she is constantly reflecting on this as she watches Hillary Clinton\u2019s progress, rooting for her to win the presidency. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to really break through is if people become more accustomed to seeing female leaders,\u201d she told me during an interview here late Wednesday afternoon. In particular, she said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough women in public executive roles \u2014 people don\u2019t even really know what they want to see in a female leader.\u201d She was Rhode Island\u2019s treasurer before she was its governor, and had an all-business, no-nonsense image. Then, at the start of her gubernatorial campaign, she released a television commercial that showed her riding bikes with her husband and two children. \u201cThe press could not get their heads around it,\u201d she said, adding that reporters asked her, \u201cAre you trying to convince voters that you\u2019re not this tough executive but that you\u2019re this warm and fuzzy person?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be a loving mother and also a competent finance person? It\u2019s binary with women.\u201d To listen to her was to think about Clinton and the stretches of Clinton\u2019s political career when she felt compelled to project toughness, the other chapters when she had to show warmth and her endless struggle to get the ratio just right. Most male politicians don\u2019t go through that. \u201cI just admire her perseverance and her personal resilience,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t to say she\u2019s perfect. She\u2019s made plenty of mistakes.\u201d In addition to the three Democratic women who are governors right now, there are three Republicans: Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Out of 50 current governors, six women. And out of 44 American presidents, none. If Clinton changes that, Raimondo said, it will help to change the way girls like that 8-year-old from Massachusetts see their futures and their world. \u201cLittle girls \u2014 8 years old, 9 years old, 10 \u2014 come up to me and say, literally, \u2018You make me think that I can do that,\u2019 \u201d Raimondo said. \u201cI know it sounds like something you read in a book, but it\u2019s happened to me 500 times. It\u2019s a much bigger impact than I ever realized.\u201d That\u2019s not reason alone to elect someone. Raimondo wasn\u2019t suggesting as much. But it\u2019s something to consider well beyond the 2016 presidential race: what our lineup of leaders \u2014 corporate as well as political \u2014 says to the next generation, and how the paucity of women on top puts the ones who\u2019ve made it there under a special microscope. Time and again as president, Barack Obama has chosen to use cautious language, at times frustrating both his allies and critics. His descriptions of corporate America\u2019s misbehavior during the financial crisis sounded like cocktail-party chatter compared with Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s jeremiads. Obama\u2019s sporadic refusal to utter \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cradical Islam\u201d has become a Republican meme.All of which highlights the bluntness and harshness of his attacks on Donald Trump on Wednesday night.\u201cAnyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or,\u201d Obama said, pausing slightly, \u201chomegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.\u201d Look at that list: A president notorious for his cool demeanor compared the opposing party\u2019s presidential nominee to America\u2019s two great 20th-century enemies and its bloodthirsty 21st-century enemy.Mr. Obama has now been on the national scene for 12 years and a day, dating to his 2004 speech at this same convention. Can you think of any personal insult that he has levied in that time that remotely approaches this one? I cannot. And I don\u2019t think Obama did it casually.Every living person who has held the office of the presidency \u2013 three Democrats and two Republicans, spanning 32 years in the White House \u2013 views Trump as unfit to hold it. Were he to win, the country could enter a period of instability few of us have known.The third night of the Democratic convention was the night that the party tried to raise the level of alarm about the Trump danger.Will the bracing honesty about Trump work?

{"Headline": "Poaching Leaves Elephant Daughters in Charge", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "As illegal hunting thins out the ranks of matriarchs, their daughters are taking over as leaders of their social groups.Supported byAround a bend stood several families totaling about 50 elephants in a loose cluster. They munched leaves from trees, thrashing and breaking branches spiked with long thorns, or stood basking in the sun, swaying their trunks and fanning their giant ears. Babies that nestled against older elephants looked as pliable as putty, cuddly as oversize toys, even though newborns weigh about 200 pounds.The youngsters and adolescents were led by young females \u2014 daughters that prematurely stepped into the roles of matriarchs after ivory poachers killed their mothers. A mother elephant typically becomes head of the family at about age 35. The younger set here ranged from 15 to 28.The oldest, Desert Rose, began leading her young cousins after their matriarch, Maua, was killed in April 2014 by a poacher\u2019s automatic rifle.A few curious elephants approached his vehicle. One rested her tusks against the roof rack, giving the vehicle a gentle but powerful nudge before stepping away. Eventually, the elephants finished munching leaves and trooped to a gushing river nearby. One by one, the animals from the different families crossed, spraying themselves and frolicking in the brown water. Even the de facto young matriarchs rolled and played. Trumpeting blasted through the air.Poaching has wiped out scores of pachyderms and their matriarchs, prompting researchers to study elephants more closely to monitor the orphans and the complex social ties within the family networks. From 2010 to 2012 alone, approximately one-fifth of Africa\u2019s elephant population \u2014 about 100,000 \u2014 was slaughtered by poachers, according to Save the Elephants.Researchers worry that the loss of elders, especially the matriarchs that were targeted by poachers for their large tusks, would severely impair the ability of younger ones to survive and thrive. The matriarchs carry a vast amount of knowledge about their surroundings, including safe migratory routes, the availability of water in arid landscapes, threats from predators and other vital information.\u201cHabiba and all her brothers and sisters and cousins \u2014 they\u2019re just in a little group. Their mothers were all dead,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cThese kids stuck together, but they didn\u2019t have any adult supervision, so to speak. We were really scared about what was going to happen.\u201dLess social mothers have produced less social children with smaller networks, a phenomenon that researchers are still studying.Social networks are just one area of research for Save the Elephants, in addition to how elephants are migrating and whether orphans show negative physical effects after their mothers are killed. And though these conservation biologists study animals, their work starkly reflects the effects humans have on the elephants\u2019 environment.To understand how social networks have been affected, researchers analyzed 16 years of data about Samburu\u2019s elephants and found surprising resilience. For example, the researchers recorded positive interactions between elephants like wrapping trunks, smelling one another\u2019s mouths and rubbing one another. The researchers also noted negative behavior, like how often elephants pushed orphans away versus nonorphans.Daughters not only emulated their mothers\u2019 social behavior, younger elephants even rebuilt networks through distant social connections to families whose most mature adults had been killed. Some new matriarchs took to caring for the young immediately, but the reactions among orphans are still being studied.\u201cThe story of the Samburu orphans is one of the most poignant examples of the importance of collaboration and friendship I have seen in a nonhuman system,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cHere are wonderful examples of these orphans moving on with their lives and rebuilding their highly and critically important social world.\u201dIn 2014, Kenya toughened penalties for poaching and wildlife trafficking with fines up to $200,000, or even life imprisonment. Previously, maximum fines were about $400.A couple of days later, Dr. Wittemyer strained to spot an elephant from the window of a six-seat Cessna that looped above Samburu. From that height, the landscape was reduced to splotches of green atop a palette of dusty brown. He and Frank Pope, Save the Elephant\u2019s chief operating officer and the plane\u2019s pilot, were looking for an elephant that had lost its radio collar.Finding the multiton creature proved harder than it sounded. The landscape\u2019s monotonous patchwork mimics an elephant\u2019s coloring, and the animals often seek shelter beneath trees during the heat of day. The plane circled and lurched through the hot afternoon air, but there was no sign of the errant animal.Save the Elephants is studying the migration of elephants by using GPS radio collars and satellite-generated maps. In the past year, conservationists have put collars on 40 Samburu elephants to expand research on their movements.Through this work, Save the Elephants knows that some elephants move nearly 40 miles a day, usually under cover of night. They cover so much ground to find the food and water that depends on Kenya\u2019s rains, as well as to mate and to find safe havens. \u201cWe collared Habiba\u2019s mother for several years,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cWe knew her range. She went down south past the mountains to Il Ngwezi,\u201d he added, referring to a conservation area. \u201cUnfortunately, they all got killed.\u201dBecause the radio collars show where elephants are almost in real time, wildlife rangers can be deployed to elephants\u2019 locations to safeguard them or help them if injured.As Kenya builds more highways, railways and infrastructure, and as towns expand, researchers are studying migratory patterns of elephants in land increasingly shared with more people. The country\u2019s growing population places higher demands on land, food, water, transportation and other resources.Indeed, Kenya plans to build a corridor that includes a railway, a highway and an oil pipeline, from the Kenyan coast cutting through the country\u2019s interior to Ethiopia and South Sudan.\u201cWith these developments comes the potential to sever migration routes,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said.With information about how elephants migrate, land use planners, developers and politicians can work around wildlife routes, regulate human expansion and modify infrastructure.For example, elephants and other wildlife are using underpasses built beneath highways connecting forests in central Kenya and northern rangelands. This planning also helps Kenya\u2019s seminomadic herders whose livestock must graze and drink.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get at an elephant\u2019s mind \u2014 why it uses space across the ecosystem the way it does,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cThis is fundamental for land use planning: what kinds of areas we need to conserve outright, what types we need to facilitate movement through, and what kinds of areas are not essential to elephants.\u201dBack on the ground at the research camp, Mr. Pope of Save the Elephants flipped open his computer to a Google Earth map of the area. Orange spots depicting the elephants with radio collars are closely tracked. The previous night, one elephant covered almost 25 miles, slowly at first along electric fences and past towns. Beyond the human settlements, he made a beeline to a conservation area where he stayed and hardly moved.Mr. Pope flipped to another screen with a wildlife news feed from Asia, where stories from India involved clashes between humans and elephants, some resulting in death on both sides. India\u2019s dense population contributes to the conflict.\u201cSome conflict arises when elephants are trying to move to another area and they\u2019re forced to go through places where people live,\u201d Mr. Pope said. \u201cIf we can define and protect wildlife corridors, we have a hope of preventing this type of conflict, which is the primary challenge facing elephants in India.\u201dOn another afternoon, the Ph.D researcher Jenna Parker spent two hours watching a small group of orphans from the Spices family. They rested beneath an acacia as the noon sun burned overhead. A juvenile rested his trunk on a tree while a 4-year-old calf relaxed by lying down on his side. The bigger elephants became heavy lidded and stood resting their trunks, like canes, on the ground.Finally, the herd stirred, with elephants named Dill and Celery releasing a stream of droppings. When the elephants lumbered off, Ms. Parker jumped out of the car with plastic gloves and vials ready. She scooped up the warm, grass-green dung for her collection of more than 1,200 samples that she will test for parasites, the stress hormone cortisol and E. coli bacteria.Ms. Parker is studying whether orphans show physiological stress after mothers have been killed. The goal is to understand how humans, through poaching, \u201chave altered the well-being of another highly social, cognitively advanced species,\u201d she said.It will take several years for her research to yield results. \u201cScience is a slow process,\u201d Ms. Parker said. She climbed back into the vehicle to follow another family across the savanna.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Earnings Are Up, Cushioned by Its Cloud Business", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft is best known for software products like Windows and Office. If you bought a PC, more often than not it came with Windows, and chances are you bought a copy of Office to go with it.But the personal computers that Microsoft makes a lot of software for aren\u2019t selling the way they once did. And the company\u2019s entry into the smartphone business \u2014 which has been eating into PC sales for several years \u2014 was a disaster.It\u2019s a good thing Microsoft is determined not to miss the boat on cloud computing, a current trend that connects people over the internet to software hosted in big data centers.On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter.Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers.\u201cI think they\u2019ve done extraordinarily well,\u201d said Merv Adrian, an analyst at the technology research firm Gartner. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody else who is arguably the challenger to Amazon that Microsoft is.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer.There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable \u2014 a trade-off for slimmer margins.After Microsoft\u2019s misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business.Microsoft bought Nokia\u2019s mobile handset business in 2014 for $9.4 billion, with the goal of making Windows relevant in smartphones, a market dominated by Google\u2019s Android software and Apple\u2019s iPhones.Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago.For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier.Still, Microsoft sometimes manages to outperform the PC market, as it did this quarter, often through sales of the operating systems for higher-end machines.The company\u2019s Windows revenue from PCs sold for the professional market rose 2 percent in the quarter. Windows revenue from the nonprofessional market rose 27 percent, though that was in comparison with an unusually weak quarter last year.For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier.The company\u2019s shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.The loss a year ago included $8.4 billion in charges related to a write-down in the value of the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia, along with expenses from layoffs in that group. The pain continued in its most recent quarter with further write-downs and restructuring charges related to its phone business totaling $1.1 billion.Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.Without the deferral, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion, better than the $22.14 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. And excluding the deferral and phone business charges, it earned 69 cents a share, better than the 58 cents a share average estimate of analysts.About 6 cents a share of the upside in its earnings was the result of a lower-than-expected tax rate, Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a phone interview.\u201cThis is a nice strong quarter,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s still a company in a pivot with some declining legacy businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Right Age for a Child to Get a Smartphone?", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byTech FixNOT long ago, many parents wondered at what age they should give their child full access to the car keys. Nowadays, parents face a trickier question: At what age should a child own a smartphone?The smartphone, after all, is the key to unfettered access to the internet and the many benefits and dangers that come with it. But unlike driving a car, which is legal in some states starting at the age of 16, there is no legal guideline for a parent to determine when a child may be ready for a smartphone.\u201cI think that age is going to trend even younger, because parents are getting tired of handing their smartphones to their kids,\u201d said Stacy DeBroff, chief executive of Influence Central.But Mr. Steyer added that other parents might decide that their children are ready sooner. \u201cNo two kids are the same, and there\u2019s no magic number,\u201d he said. \u201cA kid\u2019s age is not as important as his or her own responsibility or maturity level.\u201dSo how do you determine the right time? To come up with some guidelines, I interviewed internet safety experts and combed through studies on smartphone use among children. I also asked for parents\u2019 advice on regulating smartphone use and keeping children safe.The takeaway will not please smartphone makers: The longer you wait to give your children a smartphone, the better. Some experts said 12 was the ideal age, while others said 14. All agreed later was safer because smartphones can be addictive distractions that detract from schoolwork while exposing children to issues like online bullies, child predators or sexting.\u201cThe longer you keep Pandora\u2019s box shut, the better off you are,\u201d said Jesse Weinberger, an internet safety speaker based in Ohio who gives presentations to parents, schools and law enforcement officials. \u201cThere\u2019s no connection to the dark side without the device.\u201dLet\u2019s start with some of the data. Ms. Weinberger, who wrote the smartphone and internet safety book \u201cThe Boogeyman Exists: And He\u2019s in Your Child\u2019s Back Pocket,\u201d said she had surveyed 70,000 children in the last 18 months and found that, on average, sexting began in the fifth grade, pornography consumption began when children turned 8, and pornography addiction began around age 11.There is also biology to consider. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that controls impulse, finishes developing in the mid-20s. In other words, parents should not be surprised if younger children with smartphones lack impulse control.Smartphones undoubtedly bring benefits. With the devices, children gain access to powerful apps, including education tools for studying, chat apps for connecting with friends and the wealth of information on the web.In the end, such cons may outweigh the pros, Ms. Weinberger said. If you hold off giving smartphones to children, many still have access to technology tools through devices like computers and tablets, she added. The main difference with a smartphone is that it is with a child everywhere, including outside of parental supervision.Ultimately, parents will determine when their child truly needs a smartphone. When that time comes, there are approaches for testing the waters before handing one to the child.Lynn Muscat, a parent in San Francisco, said she had considered buying a \u201cdumb phone\u201d for her 10-year-old son to keep in touch while he was at summer camp. She ended up buying the LG GizmoGadget, a Verizon smartwatch that has calling and texting capabilities and a locked-down list of contacts so that her son could interact only with people she had approved.Ms. Muscat said she did not consider buying her child a smartphone partly because she felt the device would make him a target for muggers. She also was not appreciative of how smartphones had affected other children around him.\u201cIt drives me nuts when I see his friends on it all the time \u2014 it seems very antisocial,\u201d Ms. Muscat said. She said she planned to use the smartwatch to teach the responsibilities of using a mobile device safely before her son eventually earns the privilege of carrying a smartphone.Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media said he set other limits, like no smartphones at the dinner table and no phones in the classroom. If his children break the rules, he takes their phones away.There are some phone settings that can help keep children safe when they do get smartphones.\u201cMy only job as a parent is to prepare you for the day you leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I have to keep you safe, and you\u2019re not going to like some of the things I say \u2014 and that\u2019s O.K.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "High-Tech Wagering Sees Gateway Into America: The Horse Track", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 Ever since the first bookie stood on a step ladder and scrawled odds on a chalkboard, betting on horse racing was just about picking winners.No more.Here, where betting on a horse race (or anything at all) is a cherished pastime, you can wager on a horse to lose.You can bet in the middle of a race \u2014 much the way Wall Street traders buy and sell stock based on market fluctuations \u2014 and even cash out a winning ticket before the race is over, if the price is right.This new style of betting, called exchange wagering, was pioneered by Paddy Power Betfair, helping it become the world\u2019s largest publicly traded online gambling company.Exchange wagering has been available since May in New Jersey, where Betfair will sponsor the Haskell Stakes on Sunday at Monmouth Park in Oceanport. It is part of a broader strategy to woo young gamblers comfortable with fast-paced, tech-focused betting and get ahead in what is expected to be the widespread legalization of sports gambling in the United States.Betfair is not the only European bookmaker to target the United States, where momentum for legalizing sports betting is at a high. The bookmaker William Hill, based in London, has become a dominant operator of sports books in Nevada, where betting on games is already legal.But Paddy Power, through its subsidiary Betfair US, has chosen horse racing as its American beachhead and exchange wagering as its lure to draw new customers. Think eBay for gamblers, with wagers being made in real time by traders allowed to post odds and prices for peers to accept or reject.In betting parlance, the over/under is five years on when legalized sports gambling will be available outside Nevada.\u201cThere is no question in my mind we\u2019re going to have this happen,\u201d Tim Wilmott, the chief executive of Penn National Gaming, a company with 27 casinos and racetracks in 17 states, said recently at the East Coast Gaming Congress in Atlantic City.The European incursion has met resistance from American racetrack operators, many of whom are also gambling companies. Two of the biggest, Churchill Downs Inc. and the Stronach Group, fear exchange wagering will cut into their profits. While Churchill operates the Kentucky Derby and the Stronach Group the Preakness Stakes, both have prohibited Betfair\u2019s exchange wagering, citing concerns it will encourage race fixing.\u201cThere are integrity issues,\u201d said Mike Rogers, the president of the racetrack division of the Stronach Group, which owns prestigious tracks in California and Florida. \u201cExchange waging allows a customer to bet a horse to lose, and we are still concerned about the current economics that is being returned to the industry.\u201dBut Betfair is pushing ahead, with its sights on what could be lucrative terrain if sports betting is legalized beyond Nevada.Legislators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and California have already pushed legislation to legalize sports betting in order to increase state revenue. A formal lobbying effort on Capitol Hill for the expansion of legalized wagering by casinos and gambling interests may begin as early as 2017.American professional sports leagues, once among the fiercest opponents, are getting ready for an era in which betting is legal. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said that betting on his league\u2019s games should be legal and regulated.The N.H.L. recently awarded its 31st franchise to Las Vegas, Sin City itself.Some see the rush to embrace gambling as just that, a rush without careful scrutiny.\u201cWe are pretty concerned about the ability of states to adequately address the impacts of legalized and expanded sports betting on problem gamblers and other vulnerable groups,\u201d said Keith S. Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, which as a group remains neutral on legalized gambling. \u201cThey have done a pretty terrible job with most other forms of legalized gambling.\u201dStill, there are signs the public wants to bet on sports. Nearly two-thirds of the population \u2014 63 percent, according to a recent poll by Seton Hall University \u2014 believes that betting on sports should be legal, and 68 percent of the respondents said sports betting\u2019s legality should be decided at the state level.Last year, Nevada sports books took in a record $4.2 billion in legal wagers, a number that is dwarfed by the billions bet illegally through offshore internet sites or operations run by organized crime. Nearly $150 billion is bet illegally by people in the United States, according to estimates by law enforcement and industry groups, a number that easily doubles when illegal wagering globally is factored in.Under a ratio used in Nevada, the American Gaming Association concluded American casinos could increase annual revenue by at least $8 billion if sports betting was extended beyond Nevada.With advanced technologies \u2014 mobile as well as online \u2014 already in place and a record of taking bets at a large scale, William Hill and Betfair have a huge head start on their American competitors.In Betfair\u2019s case, it is almost a turnkey operation. It already owns two television channels that broadcast more than 40,000 races a year and is available in more than 40 million homes in the United States.It also operates an online betting site, TVG, that handles $1 billion annually on horse racing bets in the United States.\u201cThey already got very robust services in place,\u201d said Sebastian Sinclair, president of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a research and consulting firm that specializes in gambling and entertainment. \u201cThey also have gone through the regulatory process in England and Ireland and have passed rigorous examinations. It gives them a leg up.\u201dKip Levin, president of Betfair US, acknowledged that his company is poised to reap a windfall if sports gambling is legalized in the United States. But he added that over the past eight years Betfair has devoted its efforts, as well as tens of millions of dollars, to become the dominant player in an underrated market in the United States: horse racing.Last year, for example, $3.59 billion was bet online legally in the United States on horse racing, generating roughly $700 million in revenue, according to publicly published data from state racing commissions.That total is four times the $158 million in revenue generated by online casinos, and more than double the $300 million in revenue generated by daily fantasy sports, according to numbers compiled by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a financial research firm.\u201cOur focus is, and has been, on growing horse racing through the television stations, our account wagering and now the exchange,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf sports betting becomes legal in the United States, we are ready and in the position to capitalize on it.\u201dBetfair\u2019s pursuit of gamblers in the United States began here from an office in Silicon Docks, where blue chip tech companies like Google, Facebook, Airbnb, LinkedIn and Twitter have taken root. Its interiors are familiar to start-ups the world over, rows of tabletop desks and blinking computer screens in open-air bullpen fashion.The difference is that not only are the ubiquitous television screens tuned to a never-ending stream of horse races, soccer games and almost every conceivable sporting event that can be bet on, but working alongside the engineers and programmers are seasoned bookies. Among them is Gethin Evans, 37, who started with an odds board and money box at English betting rings at racetracks like Ascot and Cheltenham.To Evans, \u201csmart is the new lucky\u201d is more than just the tag line for Betfair\u2019s American advertising campaign. It is the sum of the lessons that he learned assessing risk, crunching data and bringing it to bear for some of Europe\u2019s leading betting operators.He has been paired with Bart Barden, a product manager who previously worked for divisions of Electronic Arts and Microsoft, to spread the gospel of exchange wagering in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have a cutting edge technology,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou got to anticipate how and why your customers want to use it and then give them all the tools they need to feel comfortable. Gambling is about finding an edge or insight and being able capitalize on it.\u201dIn Betfair\u2019s case, the technology is its exchange wagering platform that allows bettors to set and lock in their wagers at their own odds while also offering bettors midrace options.So far 21 tracks in the United States have allowed their races to be part of the Betfair exchange. Among those races will be those run at the Breeders\u2019 Cup World Championships, which include one of America\u2019s most prestigious and lucrative days of racing. Unlike fixed odds books, which are at the mercy of the outcome of the bets, the exchange takes a fee for processing a transaction.In Ireland, for example, Nyquist, the Kentucky Derby champion, is the 6-5 favorite to win the Haskell at fixed-odds sports books. You either take him or leave him at those odds.In the United States, where parimutuel wagering reigns, bettors are pitted against one another. If Nyquist opens at 6-5 and you bet on him, but so does everyone else, the odds might drop to 2-5 and that is what you are stuck with. If Nyquist wins, instead of getting the $4.40 you counted on, the return is only $2.80 for a $2 bet.On the Betfair exchange, however, a wager can be created by a bettor. For instance, the bettor can bet Nyquist will lose, and seek odds of 4-1. So, if any horse in the field upsets the Kentucky Derby champ, the bettor receives $10. The bettor can also hedge that wager by betting on Nyquist to win if, as the race is being run, it is clear that the colt will not be caught.The exchange platform also offers an automated feature called Cash Out that lets a bettor ensure a profit or mitigate a loss with one click of a smartphone or laptop at any time before the race is over. The feature instantly analyzes the bettor\u2019s market position against all other trades being offered by other bettors.So, if a New Jersey gambler takes Nyqvist to win at 7-5 in and the colt is loose on the lead after six furlongs, the Cash Out feature lets the bettor take a smaller profit before Nyqvist hits the wire, whether the colt ultimately prevails or gets caught in the final jump by a closer.The company has countered concerns that the exchange provides a ripe environment for fixing horse races or sporting matches by entering agreements with various leagues and sports organizations around the world to share information on any unusual betting patterns.In Europe, the exchange\u2019s impact has been dizzying as well as lucrative. Last year, Betfair had 1.7 million customers who made about 1.2 billion bets, an average of 3,287,671 bets a day. But the statistic that gets hearts pounding in American horse racing is the average age of customers on the European exchange: 38 compared with 52, the average age of TVG account holders in the United States. Those bettors, however, are wagering on a variety of sports.\u201cIt goes to the heart of what horse racing wants here: new and younger fans,\u201d said Joe Harper, president and chief executive of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.Exchange wagering has been approved in California, but opposition from the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, as well as some prominent owners, has stalled its implementation.\u201cSomething new is not always met with open arms in the horse racing industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why it is so important that exchange wagering becomes a good experience in New Jersey. It can melt away opposition.\u201d\u201cExchanges bring in new demographics precisely because they offer a low vigorish to the most price sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSabotaging this edge sabotages the exchange\u2019s No. 1 selling point.\u201dThe early returns in New Jersey are encouraging, but company officials concede that American bettors face a steep learning curve. In the first seven weeks of operation in New Jersey, exchange wagering on thoroughbreds was $1,142,228, according to the New Jersey Racing Commission.In a typical seven-week period New Jersey handles about twice that number, $2.4 million, online and by phone.\u201cWe seem to be successful so far in attracting people from beyond the traditional tote pools, and liquidity,\u201d said Bart Barden, director of US Exchange, which is part of Betfair US. \u201cBoth of those bode well as we ramp up our marketing efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pok\u00e9mon Go Brings Augmented Reality to a Mass Audience", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 There are video games that go viral overnight, causing people to coop themselves up in their homes for days to play.Boon Sheridan, a resident of Holyoke, Mass., has seen the activity firsthand. His home, a converted gable-roofed church that once attracted worshipers, had without his knowledge been designated a Pok\u00e9mon \u201cgym,\u201d a place where players who reach Level 5 in the game must go to train their Pok\u00e9mon characters. In the last week, as the game became the most downloaded and top grossing app, he has been wondering how to explain to neighbors all the people who congregated on the sidewalk and pulled up at odd hours.\u201cI want to make sure I tell them, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not a drug dealer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cI know there are people pulling up in front of the house all the time, but trust me I have no say in this.\u201dIn the case of Pok\u00e9mon Go, players traverse the physical world following a digital map, searching for cartoon creatures that surface at random. People look through their smartphone cameras to find Pok\u00e9mon. When an animated creature appears, they toss Pok\u00e9balls at it until it is subdued.But Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s public nature is also causing unforeseen side effects, attracting crowds that disturb homeowners and creating opportunities for criminals to lure players to remote areas where they can be targeted for theft. In Australia, police have issued tips for how roving Pok\u00e9mon Go players can safely play the game.Many technology companies thought A.R. might first take off through specialized business applications that, for example, allow architects to visualize finished building projects in situ. Instead, it took a game based on a beloved entertainment franchise from the mid-1990s in Japan to help the technology go mainstream.Pok\u00e9mon, a hybrid of the words \u201cpocket\u201d and \u201cmonsters,\u201d belongs to the Pok\u00e9mon Company, which is partly owned by Nintendo, the Japanese game pioneer, which has struggled to adapt to the era of gaming on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In the cartoon, Pok\u00e9mon trainers use characters to battle each other for sport. The uptake of Pok\u00e9mon Go, which is so far available only in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, has been so furious that it sent Nintendo\u2019s market capitalization soaring $9 billion in the last few days.Niantic partnered with the Pok\u00e9mon Company to make Pok\u00e9mon Go. Mr. Hanke said he didn\u2019t have exact numbers of Pok\u00e9mon Go players, but that it was safe to say it will be \u201cquite a bit beyond\u201d the number of players Ingress has attracted. Downloads of Pok\u00e9mon Go have been so frequent that Niantic\u2019s servers had trouble handling the traffic and the company is struggling to add additional capacity. Mr. Hanke said Niantic was delaying the game\u2019s introduction in additional countries for a few days so it could handle the demand.\u201cWe expected it to be popular, but we didn\u2019t expect it to be like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting our feet underneath us.\u201dLike the most successful mobile games, while Pok\u00e9mon Go is free to play, it gives players opportunities to buy virtual items for a few dollars to speed up their progress. The game\u2019s real-world nature also gives Niantic another intriguing moneymaking possibility, by charging fast-food restaurants, coffee shops and other retail establishments to become sponsored locations where people are motivated to go to pick up virtual loot.Niantic has cut deals like that for Ingress, and Mr. Hanke said the company would announce sponsored locations for Pok\u00e9mon Go in the future.Nintendo referred questions to a Pok\u00e9mon Company representative, who declined to comment on Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s popularity.Jan Dawson, a technology analyst at Jackdaw Research, said Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s success was an important moment for augmented reality, mainly because it doesn\u2019t require expensive extra equipment like a headset, which virtual reality games often need.\u201cThis clearly demonstrates that A.R. can cross over into the mainstream on the devices people already have in at least some cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily do anything for the kind of A.R. and V.R. experiences big companies are piling so much money into.\u201dFor players, Pok\u00e9mon Go has been a health booster and a social cementer. Kay Collins, a 22-year-old health care worker in San Francisco, played the game for half a day straight on Sunday, including while waiting in line at a tattoo parlor.\u201cMy pedometer says I\u2019ve taken way, way more steps throughout the day than I used to before I started playing this game,\u201d she said, adding that it had helped her explore her neighborhood.Brad Ensworth, a San Francisco State University student who played the game over the weekend, said he had never been a fan of augmented reality gaming before Pok\u00e9mon Go, but was drawn in by the game\u2019s surprisingly social aspect.\u201cYou\u2019ll just run into people and spark up conversations immediately,\u201d he said while playing the game in Golden Gate Park. \u201cWe met this one guy who drove up from San Jose to collect Pok\u00e9mon in the park, and he had more knowledge about this game than anyone else we\u2019ve met so far. We called him the Guru.\u201dPok\u00e9mon Go mass gatherings are also on the horizon. Sara Witsch, a theater studies major at San Francisco State University, organized a Facebook group for a \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go crawl\u201d that is tentatively scheduled for July 20. As of Monday evening, more than 18,000 people had indicated they were interested in attending, and more than 3,700 confirmed that they would be there.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a town where a bar was offering a discount to Pok\u00e9mon Go players.

{"Headline": "Price-Fixing Truck Makers Get Record E.U. Fine: $3.2 Billion", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief imposed a record fine of 2.9 billion euros, or $3.2 billion, on a group of truck makers on Tuesday, part of a trend toward steeper penalties for competition violations in the 28-nation bloc.Among the companies cited in the statement for having broken antitrust rules is the truck maker MAN, which is owned by Volkswagen. MAN is not among the companies being fined, however, as it revealed the existence of the cartel.In the statement, the commission said it did not find any links between the cartel and so-called defeat devices installed by Volkswagen in passenger cars.The truck makers being fined are DAF, Daimler, Iveco and Volvo-Renault. Daimler faces the largest single fine, and it must pay slightly more than \u20ac1 billion, also a record.Together, the five companies account for about nine in 10 medium and heavy trucks produced in Europe, the commission said.A sixth company, Scania, was not included in the fines announced on Tuesday as it has not settled.Fines in the region for cartel violations have steadily risen in recent years, largely because financial punishment is the main way for European Union regulators, who unlike their American counterparts cannot jail price-fixers, to enforce their laws. From 1990 to 1994, the bloc imposed fines on cartels totaling \u20ac540 million. Two decades later, from 2010 to 2014, the commission imposed fines on cartels totaling \u20ac8.7 billion.Even so, the number of American companies in her sights has led some critics to suggest that Ms. Vestager and her predecessors have a bias against competition from the United States. The record-breaking fines imposed against the truck companies \u2014 which are all based in Europe \u2014 could help counter that view.In a separate case on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager\u2019s team opened an investigation into whether French government plans for financially supporting Areva, a beleaguered state-owned maker of equipment for nuclear power plants, are compatible with European Union competition rules.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter, Grappling with Anemic Growth, Tries to Bolster Its Advertising Business", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a description that is also applicable to Twitter.Not so for Twitter. For months, the San Francisco-based company has been grappling with worsening advertising growth and anemic audience growth. It risks losing out on top talent and deals to other bigger, stronger companies.Twitter posted revenue of $602 million for the quarter, up 20 percent from a year ago and below Wall Street estimates of $607 million. Its net loss narrowed to $107 million, or 15 cents a share. Twitter\u2019s users grew 3 percent from a year ago, to 313 million.Looking ahead, the company projected revenue of $590 million to $610 million for the current quarter, far below analyst estimates of $681 million.Still, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, struck an upbeat note.\u201cAs C.E.O., I\u2019ve seen a lot of the benefit of our focus and execution over the past year,\u201d he said in a conference call with investors on Tuesday.At the heart of the problem is that the 10-year-old company is still struggling with how to make its product appealing to an audience on a larger scale. Part of the challenge has been direct comparisons to Facebook, which lures more than 1.65 billion monthly visitors to its site.For a time, Twitter was able to sidestep concerns about its ability to add new users because of the strength of its advertising business; revenue was growing in the high double-digit figures.That has changed. Over the last six months, Twitter has experienced slower growth in advertiser demand, spooking investors and causing its stock to plummet.Twitter\u2019s inability to attract new users caught up to it, analysts said, causing a stagnation in advertiser demand. As Twitter is less able to increase the size of its user base, advertisers are more likely to buy ads on Facebook, which has a huge global reach, or perhaps Snapchat, which caters largely to younger audiences.\u201cIt all goes back to the company focusing on building a ubiquitous product and failing to deliver on that promise,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.To turn itself around, Twitter has bet on live streaming video. The company has struck agreements with the National Football League, Bloomberg and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, among others, to live stream events. Twitter will also try to sell more costly ads \u2014 namely video ads, which carry a much higher premium \u2014 to its existing advertiser base.\u201cWe\u2019ve become a video-centric platform,\u201d Adam Bain, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in the company\u2019s conference call on Tuesday. \u201cIt is now the No. 1 ad format in terms of revenue on Twitter.\u201dThe company is also working on bolstering what is called direct response advertising, which prompts users to take an action like downloading a mobile app or signing up for a newsletter. The effectiveness of those ads, Twitter said, is easier to measure, which could provide repeat business. While such ads are currently a small portion of the company\u2019s overall advertising revenue, Twitter hopes to increase it over time, said Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer.\u201cWe\u2019re focused now on what matters most, and what we need to fix,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.Advertisement"}

I have a better chance of winning an Olympic gold in gymnastics than of connecting those dots. But why should Donald Trump\u2019s coronation be any tidier than his campaign? He indulges his whims. He goes with his gut. And the opening of the Republican National Convention here was a mirror of the man: visceral, rambling, sporadically mesmerizing, occasionally baffling, brimming with contempt for Hillary Clinton and beset by divisions within the G.O.P. It wasn\u2019t the star-studded, gee-whiz show that he once promised, and this, too, reflected Trump. His sales pitch is grand, even when the product is anything but. But there was oddity nonetheless, starting just after dawn. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s de facto campaign manager, used a string of morning appearances to denounce John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for not endorsing Trump, calling that calculation \u201cdumb, dumb, dumb.\u201d He thus focused attention on all of the prominent Republicans who were skipping this convention rather than on all of the prominent Republicans who did show up. How is that smart, smart, smart? And Melania\u2019s remarks were a reminder of the way in which a man who has had three families is somehow being presented to voters as the ultimate family man. \u201cDonald is intensely loyal,\u201d she said, though there\u2019s plenty in his biography to suggest otherwise. \u201cDonald intends to represent all the people, not just some of the people,\u201d she added, though there\u2019s nothing in the way he won the Republican nomination to give voters any assurance of that. Her 15-minute testimonial will be followed in the nights to come by speeches by all of his children except the one still in grade school. Indeed, his brood has been so present and peripatetic during this campaign that I imagine them as some contemporary political analogue to the Partridge family, clattering around the country in a gilded jet instead of a multicolored bus. For the most part, though, Melania simply stated over and over again what a one-of-a-kind talent her husband is and what an amazing president he\u2019d be. Her language didn\u2019t vary much, her details were few and her evidence, to the extent that she provided any, wasn\u2019t particularly compelling. She\u2019s his perfect match, not just in love but in vagueness. We learned nothing important from her, but we learned something important about him when he introduced her. It was an unusual move, coming into the arena like that, and it stirred speculation among observers \u2014 and fear among his supporters \u2014 that he\u2019d pull a stunt like he did when he monopolized the microphone at Mike Pence\u2019s big unveiling, letting his sidekick know just how far to the side he\u2019d be kicking. CLEVELAND \u2014 Andra Lance scolded me for not having heard that Bill Clinton, while he was Arkansas governor, had visited \u201crich hotshots who want to run the world\u201d promising them secret, special favors from his, and now his wife\u2019s, administration. Most liberals, who have their own like-minded news sites, have never heard of these websites. But they\u2019re where the alt-right gets much of its news. They\u2019re also where Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign got the Star of David artwork and the spurious black-on-white crime statistics for his tweets. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re right about everything,\u201d Ms. Lance said. \u201cBut they are right about a lot of things.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not much of a conspiracy theorist,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there could very well be something going on.\u201d \u201cOur enemy is not other Republicans,\u201d Pastor Mark Burns, from South Carolina, told the convention hall, \u201cbut is Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.\u201d Pastors on all sides of the aisle sometimes get carried away by their politics or ideology, but I can\u2019t remember ever hearing a minister give a benediction that described a political rival as the \u201cenemy\u201d and was so nakedly polarizing: Somehow Jesus\u2019 message morphed from \u201clove your neighbor\u201d to \u201cDemocrats are the enemy.\u201d God should sue the Republican National Convention for defamation. When I came upon the scene, all I could tell was that two men were shouting at each other at very close range. Then I realized the elderly man wearing a bedazzled jean jacket with the founding fathers on the back was Mr. King. The Republican National Convention so far is like South by Southwest for washed-up entertainers. People not granted access to the Quicken Loans Arena itself float from event to event, stopping to congregate in a mass around any vaguely recognizable C-list celebrity they see. Shortly before Scott Baio was slated to give a prime-time speech, Mr. King walked down Hudson Avenue with a small entourage. \u201cThis is fantastic! We are fighting for a better America!\u201d Mr. King told no one in particular. The man who had been grilling Mr. King in the doorway of the Marriott Hotel once again pressed him on his past, specifically his manslaughter conviction. \u201cYou killed a guy,\u201d the interrogator from the Marriott standoff said. \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Mr. King said absent-mindedly, before he registered the comment. \u201cWhat? Honestly, I accept a deep sympathy for the loss of a human being, but not for being human.\u201d He continued walking down Huron Road, destination unknown. \u201cDon King! Don King! I love you!\u201d a male Trump supporter yelled. A female Trump supporter stopped Mr. King to take a selfie with him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Baby. Look at me, look at me, look at me,\u201d she said, as if she were taking a photo of a puppy. I decided to embrace the enveloping abyss and ask Don King a semi-serious question: What did he make of the report that Reince Priebus did not want him to speak at the convention? \u201cI think he\u2019s been lost in a capsule, a time capsule. You know that guy \u2014 what\u2019s that guy, he needs to go back in time? What\u2019s his little name?\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cHe must be Rip Van Winkle. That\u2019s what it is. He is Rip Van Winkle! He\u2019s been asleep for 20 years because he don\u2019t know what time it is!\u201d It was the most astute political commentary I\u2019d heard all day. To hear Donald Trump talk, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2003 vote in favor of the Iraq war disqualifies her for the presidency. \u201cIn short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a policy speech in June. \u201cIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place.\u201d Of course, if he believed this, he\u2019d have to drop out of the race, too. Asked about the disparity, Mr. Trump did not even flinch. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said about Mr. Pence\u2019s pro-war position. The vote took place a \u201clong time ago,\u201d and Mr. Pence \u201cis entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,\u201d Mr. Trump added. But Mrs. Clinton is not? \u201cNo. She\u2019s not,\u201d he replied. As for his own past position on the war, he\u2019s giving himself a pass. Many of the speeches at the Trump convention promise to be interesting mostly in their awkwardness. (Watch as Paul Ryan pretends that his party is nominating Jack Kemp! Watch as Chris Christie enacts the final act of \u201cDoctor Faustus\u201d!) But anyone interested in the legacy of Trumpism as a movement, rather than just a one-election-cycle cult, should pay close attention to three speakers. Second, Ivanka Trump, speaking Thursday. The jokes about Trump considering his daughter as a running mate were (probably) just that, but it\u2019s clear that Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are the closest thing to a superego in the Trump campaign, and it\u2019s easy to imagine the father\u2019s ascent encouraging ambitions in his most impressive child. It\u2019s a bit harder to imagine Ivanka playing Marine Le Pen to Donald\u2019s Jean-Marie: A jet-setting New York socialite (and convert to Judaism) is an unlikely leader for an aggrieved heartland nationalism. But in a world where Trump can be the G.O.P. nominee, all manner of things seem possible, and her speech might drop a hint as to whether she feels any political temptations. In the media, who can tell the margins from the mainstream anymore? Video coverage of the Republican National Convention this week will be dizzyingly decentralized, with social media and regular media locked in a codependent death match \u2014 and everyman anchors, each with her own agenda, reporting or commenting on the event via social media in every conceivable digital dialect. And it\u2019s those competing dialects \u2014 among journalists, protesters, delegates, ideologues and the far-flung convention audience \u2014 that threaten to tilt into cacophony. Riots in the street have been predicted by some; riotous exchanges in the media are a certainty. From amateurs using social media, expect \u201cgotcha\u201d moments, or efforts to invent those moments, as well as the kind of \u201creverse surveillance\u201d that has recently allowed and even incentivized the filming of misdeeds by police, protesters and campaign workers. From the networks, look for a defensive crouch. They\u2019re fiercely guarding institutional authority by shooting video as if this convention were media business-as-usual, keeping their eyes on the podium and on benign cutaways (unless news they deem news breaks among the audience or protesters). While Facebook Live, the hugely popular live-streaming service, will be available as a platform for visual commentary to any of Facebook\u2019s 1.65 billion active monthly users, it also will feature C-Span\u2019s coverage front and center. This means it\u2019s not only offering polyglot and populist coverage but also monopolizing the cameras known for greatest comprehensiveness, beige-tone and neutrality. Twitter is streaming CBS\u2019s video, so the young and rambunctious service is now synced up with the Tiffany Network, which has authoritatively, even arrogantly, covered conventions (first as radio) for nearly a century. To witness CBS\u2019s god\u2019s-eye perspective streaming through Twitter\u2019s vox populi interface is sure to generate cognitive dissonance. The Republican National Convention\u2019s own robust app is live-streaming video from Google, using 360-degree cameras for, the app promises, \u201can immersive experience.\u201d The oligopoly that is Google serving as back end for the G.O.P.\u2019s self-coverage? Can anyone imagine ABC, say, playing vendor for the Republican Party in covering the convention? Public airways \u2014 and their F.C.C. mandate to provide balanced coverage \u2014 have all but disintegrated. Between cameraphone fragments and unlikely network-digital bedfellows, anticipated \u201cchaos\u201d in Cleveland this week may be mirrored, if not aggravated, by the thousands of skirmishing cameras, each with its own perspective. A: The most that I\u2019ve used is more than one million, but that\u2019s when we were going for world records. As far as the political conventions, I think the most we ever did was more than 200,000, and that was in 1992 down in Houston. In Cleveland this year we\u2019re over 100,000. A: I don\u2019t know the exact particulars; I feel bad for the people that were involved. Years ago, I developed a system when I required large amounts of labor, I would go to local high schools \u2014 primarily the music departments because I was a band geek myself back in high school. We give them a special shirt, we feed them, we pay for their buses, and at the end of the day we give them a nice honorarium that they can use for musical instruments. A: One hundred and twenty students and 20 adult chaperones. A: Oh yeah. I call the drop. It\u2019s almost like playing a piano. It\u2019s not just a cue, \u201cgo!\u201d and they all fall down. They\u2019ll come down in wave after wave after wave. There will probably be more than 20 different cues. A: We get to make the mess, but we don\u2019t have to clean up. Among the 25 prime-time speakers listed is a mother, Mary Ann Mendoza whose son was killed by an undocumented immigrant driving drunk the wrong way down an Arizona freeway. Another, Jamiel Shaw, lost his son, a high school football star, to another undocumented immigrant who had just been released from jail for offenses that probably should have gotten him deported. Patricia Smith\u2019s son died in Benghazi, Libya. The lineup also includes two siblings \u2014 the brother and sister of a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, fatally shot in 2010 on the Arizona-Mexican border by Mexican gangsters wielding an American gun they\u2019d picked up from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 much-criticized \u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d program. Mothers, this is your night. If you think that Donald Trump couldn\u2019t possibly appeal to female voters, given remarks he has made about breasts, Megyn Kelly\u2019s menstrual blood and women being \u201cdisgusting pigs,\u201d think again. Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who was recently hired by Trump\u2019s campaign, agrees. Asked by Katie Couric what Trump could do to capture women voters, she said: \u201cKeep talking about security, affordability, fairness and ethics. I call it the SAFE acronym.\u201d In a Fox News interview this month with six self-identified \u201csecurity moms,\u201d the women stressed the importance of \u201cnaming the enemy\u201d \u2014 jihadists \u2014 controlling immigration and helping them protect their children. Asked about the president\u2019s response to the killing of three police officers in Baton Rouge, La., Trump said: \u201cI mean, you know, I watched the president and sometimes the words are O.K.,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut you just look at the body language. There\u2019s something going on. Look, there\u2019s something going on and the words are not often O.K., by the way.\u201d To his credit, the host of the program, Steve Doocy, pressed Trump to explain what he meant. But of course, that\u2019s not how Trump operates. He puts ridiculous claims and accusations out there, sometimes obliquely, and refuses to take responsibility for them. \u201cThere\u2019s just a bad feeling, a lot of bad feeling about him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI see it, too. There\u2019s a lot of bad feeling about him. We have a country that has not been like this since I can remember it.\u201d What bad feeling, apart from the one among those who hate Obama because he is African-American? What kind of country does Trump mean? Who knows? The man who will be nominated as the Republican\u2019s presidential candidate this week has done this before. After the Orlando terrorist massacre, he also implied that Obama was on the side of terrorism. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable. There\u2019s something going on.\u201d There is something going on, indeed. Trump and his allies are running a campaign of racism, fear, xenophobia and social division that is horrifying, even by the standards of the current Republican Party. It has been turning itself over to these forces for decades now. Nothing that Trump says this week \u2014 if he indeed says anything unifying, moderate or conciliatory \u2014 can change that. \nSince at least 1952, no presidential candidate has overcome a polling deficit immediately after the party conventions and gone on to win the popular vote.\nOnce \u2014 in the days of Lincoln, the Roosevelts and Eisenhower \u2014 political conventions actually chose the nominee. Today, they feel like long infomercials. Yet it turns out that conventions still matter, more than many people realize. The conventions are the first time that many Americans tune into the presidential campaign. That\u2019s especially true for swing voters, most of whom don\u2019t vote in the two parties\u2019 primaries. The conventions may be infomercials, but they\u2019re infomercials that millions of people watch or otherwise pay attention to. But emerging from the conventions with a lead is a big deal. The closest thing to an exception over the last 60 years is Ronald Reagan, who was merely tied with Jimmy Carter immediately after the 1980 conventions. (George W. Bush trailed Al Gore modestly after the 2000 conventions, but, of course, also went on to lose the popular vote.) The typical pattern is for both candidates to get a boost from their own convention, but for the boosts to be different in size. And once the convention is over, any subsequent changes in the polls \u2014 yes, even after debates \u2014 tend to be small or fleeting. \u201cDebates don\u2019t have anywhere near the same effect\u201d as conventions, Erikson told me. Even more difficult, Trump will need to win over swing voters who helped elect President Obama. Somehow, Trump will have to persuade them that his string of offensive remarks about women, Muslims, Latinos, the disabled and others don\u2019t define him. He\u2019ll have to make himself seem presidential. Given Clinton\u2019s advantage and Trump\u2019s chaotic convention planning, he seems unlikely to have a great next two weeks \u2014 which would be a relief to all of us who are alarmed by the Trump phenomenon. But whatever your feelings, you shouldn\u2019t dismiss the conventions as a sideshow. Trump is, if nothing else, a skilled performer, and he has a chance to receive more focused, positive attention in Cleveland than he ever has. The next four nights represent probably his last best chance to reintroduce himself to the American public. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kevin Durant Reboots, Goes Digital", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byNotebookThere was a technical glitch. The Golden State Warriors, breakers of unbreakable records, failed to finish the season as repeat N.B.A. champions. Silicon Valley\u2019s hometown team lost to some guys from the Rust Belt. So this week the Warriors upgraded their operating system. An already-extraordinary lineup that included the league\u2019s two-time reigning M.V.P., Steph Curry, added the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Kevin Durant, the best scorer of his generation and the last M.V.P. before Curry.One study has found that the average American checks his or her phone 46 times a day. (Am I sick to admit that sounds kind of low?) There is a kind of paradox in the fact that much of what fuels those dozens of visits is content siphoned from the old citadels, New York and Hollywood. But no one reaches for Hollywood 46 times a day. Considered in that light, Durant joining the Warriors is the latest piece of evidence, if another were needed, that the cultural center of gravity has shifted from Los Angeles to Silicon Valley.All those celebrities sitting courtside at Lakers games (assuming they still go to Lakers games) \u2014 their influence has withered when set beside the rise of Netflix, Apple, Facebook and others. The video-game industry alone rivals the Hollywood box office. A different set of people, some 380 miles north of the Staples Center, now have their hands on the cultural levers. And they have the basketball team to prove it.Incredibly, Los Angeles hoped that Durant would spurn his other suitors and choose the Lakers. Once upon a time, that choice may have been tempting \u2014 the glamour, the celebrity, the movie deals. Durant didn\u2019t even take a meeting with the Lakers. (Though he did meet with the Los Angeles Clippers, the city\u2019s perpetual step-child. It went nowhere.)A snubbing like that would have been inconceivable not long ago, when the Lakers reigned: five championships in the 1980s, another five in the 2000s. You could see the city\u2019s swagger in the reflections from Jack Nicholson\u2019s sunglasses, Pat Riley\u2019s shiny slicked-back hair, Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s glistening pate.That was by design. Jerry West, a Hall of Famer who spent 40 years with the Lakers, recently published a memoir in which he recounts Jerry Buss\u2019s vision for the team, which Buss bought in 1979. \u201cJerry wasn\u2019t buying a basketball team,\u201d West writes. \u201cHe was buying the Lakers as a form of high-level entertainment, Hollywood style, including scantily clad girls.\u201dThe Lakers are no longer entertaining, haven\u2019t been in years. In the age of big data and performance-metrics analytics, the notion of sports as show business feels as dated as Busby Berkeley. Sports have become mathematics. Sports have become tech.West devoted virtually his entire life to the Lakers, first as a point guard, then as an executive. He was a Los Angeles icon through several Hollywood golden ages, a man so revered that his statue stands outside the Lakers\u2019 stadium. (As Buss put it at the dedication, \u201cHow many people ever get a statue?\u201d) Is it a coincidence that three months after the statue\u2019s unveiling, West agreed to join, of all teams, the Warriors? This is the team he now serves as a kind of spiritual adviser, bringing an aura of gravitas and success to the organization. Tech companies like to associate with graybeards in this way. And like so much else in Silicon Valley, the connection works. By several accounts, it was West\u2019s personal phone call to Durant that helped seal the deal.In his memoir, West doesn\u2019t say much about what drew him to Silicon Valley. His relationship with Lakers management had fractured. The Warriors\u2019 new tech luminaries, the owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, had an \u201centhusiasm for what they were hoping to achieve [that] was contagious.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to call Durant\u2019s move part of our long national migration west, dating back to the Gold Rush. (Through that lens, it\u2019s fitting that the team is named not after an actual city but a honeyed oasis called \u201cGolden State.\u201d) After all, where was the miserable address Tom Joad left behind? Oklahoma, same as Durant.But Durant\u2019s move to the Warriors brings a digital sheen to the story. He announced his decision in a letter posted to a relatively new site called The Players\u2019 Tribune, where his title is \u201cdeputy publisher.\u201d The site was created to bypass traditional gatekeepers, like The New York Times, by giving athletes a platform that does not require interacting with journalists. It implies nothing sinister to point out that The Players\u2019 Tribune has received millions in funding from New Enterprise Associates, one of the biggest venture firms in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s simply how the world works today.When I was growing up, my dad used to root against the Lakers because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to see all those people in Los Angeles happy.\u201d Plenty of others felt the same way: \u201cBeat L.A.\u201d became a national chant. That distaste wasn\u2019t entirely, or even mostly, about the basketball team. It was about Los Angeles as a cultural Goliath. The place represented the unreality of American myth-making, embodied our love-hate relationship with Hollywood, schlock and all, and its dominance of pop culture. That power also made it an symbol of the rich always getting richer.Our new love-hate relationship is with our phones, those gorgeous little tyrants. If you listen closely, you can hear a new chant bubbling up across the country, an almost populist protest aimed at our new overlords.\u201cBeat Golden State! Beat Golden State!\u201dSam Dolnick is an associate masthead editor and former deputy sports editor at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Mr. Murray, 61, a former deputy managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, succeeds Norman Pearlstine, 73, a former editor in chief of Time Inc. who rejoined the company in 2013 and helped guide it through its spinoff.Time Inc. also announced a broader reorganization of its advertising sales and brand development teams, including the creation of dedicated digital sales teams, as it shifts its attention away from its print products, which include magazines like Time, People, InStyle, Entertainment Weekly and Sports Illustrated.Other publishers who long depended on print advertising are also fighting to survive. But Time Inc.\u2019s approach has at times seemed frenetic. It has pushed aggressively into areas like mobile, events, video and native advertising.

{"Headline": "How to Protect Privacy While Using Pok\u00e9mon Go and Other Apps", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byIn the last few days, security bloggers noticed that the game, which is free to download and made by Niantic Inc. in partnership with the Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo, requested permission not only to use a player\u2019s smartphone camera and location data but also to gain full access to the user\u2019s Google accounts \u2014 including email, calendars, photos, stored documents and any other data associated with the login.The flap highlights how clicking \u201cyes\u201d to whatever requests pop up when installing an app on a mobile device can compromise privacy, sometimes in insidious ways. In disclosures, some apps say they will hand over data to law enforcement officials or other private parties to respond to legal requests, for example, or even on their own volition.\u201cA number of these games are not only making money on the front end by selling you the game or things within the game, they\u2019re also collecting data about your habits and what you\u2019re doing on your phone, and selling that to third-party marketers,\u201d said Andrew Storms, vice president of security services at the security company New Context. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty much giving the rights to all your information to this company.\u201dSo what can be done to minimize the security risks that come with some apps? Here\u2019s a refresher on how to safeguard private information.Ari Rubinstein, a Silicon Valley security engineer, recommends paying close attention to the scope of access that apps request during installation \u2014 or to look up the details online \u2014 and say \u201cno\u201d if the demands make you uncomfortable.If you are unsure about the permissions you have already granted, check them on iOS by clicking on Settings and scrolling down for a list of apps that you can examine and change individually. On Android, click Settings and click Apps under the Device Settings, then choose an app and select Permissions.Permissions are not the only things to worry about; you also need to know what kinds of data an app is collecting from your phone. Information about those is typically contained in an app\u2019s privacy policies, which are often available within the settings of an app, or searchable online. If you cannot find the disclosures, or you are unable to understand their legalese, consider holding off until you learn more.As for Pok\u00e9mon Go, while the game may not be digging through emails, it is capable of tracking your location. And like those of many apps, its privacy policy allows it to give any data it has about you to law enforcement officials or private parties in response to legal requests or even to whatever it may deem an unethical or legally actionable activity. It can also share nonidentifying information about you with other companies for what it says are \u201cresearch and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes.\u201dBecause apps often use platforms like Facebook and Google to authenticate accounts, Mr. Rubinstein suggests regularly checking the access you have granted through the settings of these systems.With Facebook, go to your account settings and click on Apps to examine and revoke access. With Google, go to Privacy and Security Settings and click on Connected Apps and Sites to see or change the apps connected to your account.\u201cMost likely users have apps that they never use that put them at a similar risk\u201d to that from the Pok\u00e9mon app, he said.Advertisement"}

His duties will instead be distributed among several other company executives.Mr. Turner was widely known to have ambitions of being a chief executive himself, so his departure was little surprise. When Microsoft\u2019s previous chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, announced his retirement, Mr. Turner was among several internal candidates at the company vying to replace him.The job eventually went to another internal candidate, Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in early 2014.\u201cHe was not chosen as Ballmer\u2019s successor, and it\u2019s interesting that it has been this long that he chose to leave,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.\u201cHe built the sales force into the strategic asset it is today with incredible talent, while at the same time more than doubling our revenue and driving customer satisfaction scores to the highest in company history,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a statement.In the two biggest executive promotions that will result from Mr. Turner\u2019s departure, Mr. Nadella said Judson Althoff will lead the company\u2019s worldwide commercial business and Jean-Philippe Courtois will run global sales, marketing and operations. Both men will report to Mr. Nadella and join the company\u2019s senior leadership team.Mr. Nadella said that Mr. Turner, who was with Microsoft for 11 years after spending nearly two decades as an executive at Walmart, will be at Microsoft through the end of July.And Two Sigma Investments, a quantitative hedge fund based in New York, hired Alfred Spector, a senior executive at Google, to be chief technology officer last year.Citadel Securities is owned by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, who also founded a $25 billion hedge fund called Citadel. Mr. Griffin founded the hedge fund 25 years ago as a young graduate after successfully trading bonds out of his Harvard dorm.In recent years, Mr. Griffin has made a big push into market, making and electronic trading with Citadel Securities, disrupting a business that was once the domain of banks. It operates dark pools \u2014 platforms to match buyers and sellers of securities off public exchanges \u2014 and places trades for both retail and institutional investors, processing more than a billion shares each day. It also claims to have 35 percent share of daily retail stock trading in the United States.Citadel appears in Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys,\u201d which tells the story of technology firms that have contributed to the breakup of central stock exchanges.Advertisement"}

Twice \u00addivorced, with two grown daughters \u2014 one in college, the other \u201cone of those educated, New Age, stay-at-home supermoms who does everything, including working at home as a technical writer for Apple\u201d \u2014 she suffers from a common strain of middle-class, middle-aged inertia. Single and bored with her job, she nevertheless feels she\u2019s too old to make a meaningful change. The highlight of her week is Friday night, which finds her chatting up the young pizza delivery guy and watching \u201cLaw & Order: Criminal Intent.\u201dOne day Georgia discovers that the father of a new patient was one of her friends with benefits in college. When she learns he has since died in a car crash, she\u2019s overcome with grief and regret: \u201cI should\u2019ve told Ray I loved him before he graduated. I should\u2019ve taken the risk of finding out he didn\u2019t love me.\u201dThis news rouses Georgia from her lethargy. She resolves to track down all the men she once loved to tell them how she really felt and thank them for the roles they\u2019ve played in her life. To do this, she plans to put her cool house in the Oakland hills on the market and take a long train trip across Canada, in the process figuring out what to do with her life.That in the age of Google it takes about two minutes to find almost anyone is irrelevant to the novel\u2019s loose narrative. Georgia possesses the usual (hilarious) very-late-adopter awkwardness with social media, so it takes her until midway through the book to roll up her sleeves and do some serious drunken Facebook stalking. It hardly matters, because McMillan\u2019s true subject has always been the bonds between women, and Georgia\u2019s newfound determination to remake her life provides plenty of grist for boisterous discussions with her best friends, Wanda and Violet.McMillan, justifiably celebrated for her wisecracking dialogue, also pokes some fun at midlife reinvention. It\u2019s never as easy as Oprah makes it out to be. Just as Georgia\u2019s about to put her house on the market, her younger daughter drops out of N.Y.U. after a bad breakup and stumbles home. Then Georgia\u2019s business partner needs time off to tend to ailing parents, leaving Georgia to run the practice rather than take off on her cross-country adventure. Added to the mix are a few surprise pregnancies.Janis Joplin once described herself as passionate and sloppy, and the same could be said of \u201cI Almost Forgot About You.\u201d McMillan falls back on dialogue a little too often. For every sharp and well-\u00adobserved paragraph about the challenges of aging, or wise reflection on the unexpected benefits of a failed marriage, there are too many long, overstuffed expository conversations. In addition, seemingly important story lines are introduced, including a possible foreclosure, then simply evaporate, as if the author lost interest.For fans of McMillan, and they\u2019re legion, these shortcomings won\u2019t spoil anything. Though flawed, the novel is immensely companionable, and Georgia is as alive, complex, inquiring, motivated and sexy as any 25-year-old. Maybe more so.Karen Karbo\u2019s latest book, \u201cIn Praise of \u00adDifficult Women,\u201d will be published next year.Advertisement"}

The makeover includes a redesigned reception area, shorter waiting times to enter the museum through the Louvre\u2019s pyramid and a wireless network. There are also amenities like new high-tech Japanese toilets.The same application can also be used to buy tickets online for a priority entrance and shorten the waiting time to enter to about a half an hour, according to Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum\u2019s president.\u201cThe Louvre is a palace and doesn\u2019t have the logic of a museum,\u201d said Mr. Martinez, who stood in line himself for more than two and a half hours before the restoration to experience what tourists suffered. \u201cThe little revolution here is that our application instantly gives your location in three dimensions.\u201dThe two-year restoration project \u2014 financed in part through sponsors and revenue from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi museum project \u2014 focused on common public complaints about waiting times that can be up to three hours at the entrances and confusion among newcomers who feel lost once inside.

The show followed each girl, beginning in her pregnancy, then through the baby\u2019s birth and early infancy. And viewers have been able to stay with their lives on the spinoffs \u201cTeen Mom,\u201d \u201cTeen Mom 2\u201d and \u201cTeen Mom 3.\u201diToday, America\u2019s birthrate for teenage mothers has hit a historic low \u2014 less than 40 percent of what it was at its modern peak in 1991, when it was 61.8 births per 1,000 girls 15 to 19 years old. In 2014, the rate was 24.2 per 1,000. (In the 1950s, when more women married in their teens, the rate was even higher than the 1991 figure.)This is excellent news. Girls who get pregnant are less likely to finish their education, and their babies are at high risk for health problems, incarceration, academic troubles and, yes, teenage pregnancy \u2014 even after controlling for other factors.No one really knows why these birthrates have dropped. It\u2019s not because teenagers are having more abortions; those have dropped even more precipitously than births. The most important reason appears to be increased contraceptive use, perhaps as a result of comprehensive sex education and fear of H.I.V.Over the past seven years, that state has cut the rate of babies born to girls ages 15 to 19 by nearly half. The teenage abortion rate is down by the same amount. Repeat teenage births have dropped by 58 percent. Colorado has accomplished this with no increase in teenage sexual activity or in sexually transmitted infections. And the state has saved tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars.A main reason for Colorado\u2019s success is a program to make long-acting reversible contraceptives (known as LARCs), such as hormonal implants or intrauterine devices, available cost-free to women and girls who want them.These protect from unwanted pregnancy for years \u2014 in the case of some IUDs, 10 years. Because these methods are \u201cset and forget,\u201d they are the most reliable forms of birth control. Each year 1 percent of women on LARCs get pregnant, compared with 9 percent of women on oral contraceptives and 18 percent of those who rely on condoms.When Colorado started the LARC program, only 2.5 percent of teenagers who came for family planning in clinics for low-income or uninsured people received LARCs. Last year that figure was 28.9 percent.The push for LARCs came from the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which offered Colorado a donation of $25 million to pay for a five-year program. Colorado accepted. When five years was up in 2015, Republicans in the State Legislature killed a bill that would have provided public funding for the program to continue. A coalition of private funders chipped in to keep it going at a low level.Now, the program is again on solid ground, because the legislature reversed itself this year. Colorado now spends at a rate only half of what the Buffett Foundation did, but it\u2019s enough, because Obamacare insurers and an expanded Medicaid program now pay for much of it. (These programs are supposed to cover birth control completely, but some women and components of the program, such as training for health care workers, aren\u2019t covered.)Since Medicaid would have paid for a vast majority of the unwanted births, reducing them provides immediate savings in tax revenues. Much larger are the long-term savings produced by a better life for both mother and child. One immediate benefit is that fewer children are born into poverty: Colorado has experienced a 25 percent drop in enrollment in the government\u2019s nutrition program for low-income women and children.The challenges illustrate how difficult it is to spread new medical practices. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, has on occasion worn an IUD as a pin, so he can show people how small and light it is. Lots of people remember the Dalkon Shield of the 1970s and the injury and infertility it caused. The new IUDs are different. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your mother\u2019s IUD,\u201d Wolk likes to say.But just because something is safe doesn\u2019t mean people know it\u2019s safe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing there\u2019s a lot of education needed,\u201d said Lisa Waddell, the community health and prevention chief program officer at the health officials\u2019 association. Many young women haven\u2019t heard of LARCs, and some who have believe they are not reversible (they are, usually instantly), or are painful to use (insertion of an IUD is painful, but it can\u2019t be felt afterward). Waddell says the best remedy is word of mouth from women who are happy with their birth control.Any explanation, of course, requires a visit, and this can be a challenge. \u201cThe biggest barrier is access to care,\u201d said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Greenville Health System in South Carolina and clinical lead for the Birth Outcomes Initiative, a state government program. She said that LARCs could sometimes be a two-appointment procedure. \u201cWith a prescription for birth control pills, patients can go out and fill it. With a LARC, if we don\u2019t have one in the office that day, the patient has to come back.\u201dThis is one reason many states focus on women who have just given birth \u2014 it can be the only time women see a health care provider when they aren\u2019t pregnant. (On the other hand, it\u2019s by definition too late.)But while many state governments wanted hospitals to insert LARCs, state Medicaid systems initially discouraged the procedure with their disbursement system. Hospitals were paid a bundled amount for a birth. They weren\u2019t about to insert an $800 IUD if Medicaid wasn\u2019t going to pay them extra.In 2012, South Carolina became the first state to have its Medicaid reimburse for LARCs in a separate payment. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the dominant insurer, quickly followed. Now many states\u2019 Medicaid programs pay for LARCs this way.This policy change was necessary but far from sufficient. At last year\u2019s state health officials meeting, for example, program officials in Montana reported that the state\u2019s Medicaid added a separate payment for LARC on January 1. Yet 10 months later, only four women had received LARCs immediately after giving birth, because providers hadn\u2019t been told that they could get paid. \u201cWe currently do not have a method to contact our members with new information,\u201d the officials said.Melanie Giese, who leads South Carolina\u2019s Birth Outcomes Initiative, said that a quarter of the state\u2019s birthing hospitals are providing LARCs postpartum. She said that involving everyone from the beginning was crucial to success. \u201cPharmacy, the chief financial officer, labor and delivery, claims \u2014 everybody who\u2019s going to touch the patient or the device. You can\u2019t do it piecemeal.\u201dNo matter how groundbreaking the idea, it can be felled by the mundane details of implementation. \u201cLARCs have a lot of logistical issues that aren\u2019t present with other forms of birth control,\u201d said Crockett. \u201cThere are a lot of issues with billing, the time it takes to do the insertion, and with stocking the devices. I\u2019m very committed to making LARC available, and even I\u2019m struggling with these issues in my hospital. I learned it really takes leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Eventually, he got the lights to work remotely, but the door lock never did, so he quit trying.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately what I am looking for: Fire it up, take some time setting it up, then it just works.\u201dThese days, even a technophobe can set up a remote-control light switch or thermostat and operate it by phone. Improvements in technology, including voice recognition, artificial intelligence and more affordable sensors, have made home automation easier to use. Cheaper, too.The smart home still isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 or easy, exactly. But if you haven\u2019t used any of this technology yet, it might be time to start thinking about it. Here\u2019s what you need to know first.Smart home technology is a catchall term that includes household appliances and devices that connect to the internet, so you can see and control them remotely using a phone, tablet or computer. That can mean being able to turn on a single lamp, or controlling and monitoring almost everything in a house, including heating and cooling, security cameras, lawn sprinklers, televisions, stereos, robotic vacuums, a doorbell, door locks, lights, air quality, fire alarms, baby monitors and more. It means you\u2019ll always have the answer to the question, \u201cDid I leave the stove on?\u201dIf you stick to a single system \u2014 say, all lights or electrical outlets from the same manufacturer \u2014 setup is pretty easy. But chances are, you\u2019ll want to use products from more than one company, and that\u2019s where the difficulty comes in: Different brands use different technology, and they don\u2019t always talk to each other.The chief appeal of Apple\u2019s HomeKit is that it\u2019s comparatively easy to set up and use. Devices are paired with your phone or tablet, in much the same way you\u2019d connect a Bluetooth headset or speaker, only with more steps. And the company\u2019s next software update, due this fall, will group all the controls on one screen, so you can run your whole house from a single app. The downside: HomeKit doesn\u2019t have as many accessories as some other systems do.But tricks like these take some know-how to set up and manage. And neither Apple nor Amazon makes the plugs, switches and sensors that their systems run, which is why these systems can be a technological patchwork. Some of the accessories communicate by Wi-Fi; others use Bluetooth, radio or electrical lines, or a combination.Once you\u2019ve installed and run a simple accessory, like an on/off switch, you should feel comfortable enough to try something a little more complicated.You might start by creating \u201cscenes,\u201d which send instructions to several devices with a single voice command. This can take some time to set up, as you have to tell the central control what you want each of the individual devices to do. But by issuing a simple command like \u201cLet\u2019s watch a movie,\u201d you could have the curtains close, the lights dim and the television and DVD player turn on.\u201cEvery hour on the hour, there is a new scene,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. And he didn\u2019t stop there. He created other scenes for watching television, listening to music, eating dinner \u2014 more than a dozen in all. \u201cAt this point,\u201d he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to a normal bulb.\u201dEven so, that\u2019s not enough, Mr. Dumas said. If you follow a predictable routine, he explained, \u201cAfter a few times, it should ask, \u2018We notice when you get home and it\u2019s dark out, you turn on the hallway light, then turn on ESPN; do you want us to do that?\u2019 \u201dBut that\u2019s easier said than done.\u201cIt\u2019s so simple to comprehend the internet of Things 2.0, and people think we are there, and we aren\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Dumas said. \u201cWe are at 1.0, and there is a lot of value there, but 2.0 is where we need to go.\u201dMost of the smart home devices I tried were pretty simple to use. But the more I piled on the network, the glitchier things got.

A fund to help European news outlets adapt to the web popped up in 2015. And in March, a virtual reality exhibition began at a Belgian museum to showcase a Renaissance painter.All these projects are aimed at supporting European culture and education, helping the region embrace the fast-changing online world. And all are financed by Google.Google has been staging a full-court press in Europe to finance everything from start-up offices to YouTube-sponsored music concerts, trying to remake its image in the region as it battles a mounting list of regulatory woes.Those efforts represent a campaign of \u201csoft lobbying\u201d where instead of, or alongside, paying registered lobbyists to advocate its case in the corridors of power, a company looks to change the minds of the public at large. In Google\u2019s case, experts say, its push to sponsor digital skills training, museum exhibitions and other programs equates to an almost unprecedented effort by a United States tech company to change the perceptions of Europeans, many of whom still see it as an American interloper that does not play by the rules.Google\u2019s soft lobbying efforts are by no means unique, and have filled a funding gap that governments and European rivals are unwilling, or incapable, of matching.But the company has ramped up its campaign in recent years, earmarking about $450 million from 2015 to 2017 \u2014 based on Google\u2019s public filings and industry estimates of its activities \u2014 to revamp its reputation with Europeans and, more important, the region\u2019s policy makers who have the power to issue fines totaling billions of dollars.Google\u2019s vast array of programs \u201care important for our partners, for us and for the countries where we work,\u201d he added.Even before its recent charm offensive, it was one of the largest spenders on direct lobbying in Brussels, home to most of its European regulatory headaches.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cOf course, Google has its own agenda to show to Europe\u2019s political powers that they aren\u2019t bad guys,\u201d said Michael Peters, chief executive of Euronews. \u201cBut this gives organizations like ours the chance to do these types of projects. It wouldn\u2019t have happened without Google.\u201dThe Silicon Valley company is also tapping into a more friendly audience: Europe\u2019s tech community.In Dublin, home to Google\u2019s European headquarters, that has involved a one-year course in software coding for local teachers. Participants in the class, run by Trinity College Dublin, have been invited to the company\u2019s glass-fronted offices on the shores of the Liffey River to learn directly from Google staff members.\u201cI\u2019m so confident now that I can teach my students anything and they can just run with it,\u201d said Helen O\u2019Kelly, 38, a former Microsoft employee who retrained to become an I.T. teacher.Not all of Google\u2019s good will activities have been so well accepted.Museums still regularly question Google\u2019s motives because the tools like high-definition cameras to digitize artwork are all free. Institutions also have raised concerns about who controls the copyright of the masterpieces (Google says all rights remain with the institutions).The tech giant has often picked museums with a digital connection. That includes the restoration of Bletchley Park, a museum on the outskirts of London that housed British codebreakers during World War II and that helped spur the creation of modern-day computers.\u201cThat\u2019s typical of Americans,\u201d she said when asked about a large poster at the entrance to Bletchley Park highlighting Google\u2019s financial support.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Europeans that Google hopes to train on digital skills. The company expects to train two million, not three million, by the end of the year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Make Conventions Great Again", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byPolitical conventions used to mean something important. Specifically, they used to mean: \u201cHere is where we will pick our party\u2019s nominee.\u201dBut today\u2019s political conventions are largely dog and pony shows to make the delegates feel special, give the news media something to talk about, and benefit the host city, all while promoting the party\u2019s agenda.Party conventions \u2014 perhaps not in terms of their importance, but the sheer logistical headaches they impose \u2014 are the political equivalent of the Olympics. And what with delegates, alternates, reporters, party officials and other attendees, Cleveland is expecting roughly 50,000 people to show up for the Republican National Convention next week. (Convention planners had less time than anticipated to get Quicken Loans Arena ready, thanks to the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 run in the N.B.A. finals.)In a normal election year, a party\u2019s convention would attract a high-profile slate of speakers, including up-and-comers. (A young state senator named Barack Obama made his national debut at the 2004 Democratic convention, for example.) But this is not a normal election year, and a stunning number of Republican leaders have decided not to attend the convention.Apart from the question of star power, there is the question of money. Conventions, like the Olympics, can be a branding boost for the host cities, which is why they lobby so hard to win bids.Despite talk that the polarizing campaign would make it difficult to fund-raise for the convention this year, David Gilbert, the president and chief executive of the nonpartisan Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, said his group has raised more than 90 percent of the $64 million it was given the task of getting, \u201cfar more than any other convention in history.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve always said this was not about red or blue; it was about green,\u201d he said.Even companies that decided to stay in the convention tried to distance themselves from the presumptive Republican nominee, according to Rashad Robinson, a spokesman for Color of Change PAC. He recalled talking to an AT&T representative who stressed the company\u2019s support for immigration reform, in contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\u201cIf any one of their employees came to work and said the things that Donald Trump says in front of the media, on the campaign trail, they\u2019d be fired,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last three standard-bearers for the Republican Party aren\u2019t even going to the convention, so why do these companies feel that they need to?\u201d\u201cTo me, they\u2019re supporting democracy and the democratic process,\u201d said Chip DiPaula, a Baltimore businessman who helped organize the Republican conventions in 1996 and 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s an important celebration of American ideals that are over and above any particular nominee.\u201dMr. Robinson disagreed.\u201cThose companies are on the wrong side of history,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t give credit to people who have empathy. History gives credit to people who stand up and make decisions that are sometimes tough.\u201dMr. Gilbert, the Cleveland convention president, said this year presents \u201ccertainly a more politically charged convention cycle than we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d but added that he felt the city is well prepared.\u201cOne of the problems with this is, it\u2019s just like running any big event,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can prepare. You can plan. But until the event is over, it\u2019s not over.\u201dManaging a convention can make even the most absurd logistical problems seem important. Maria Cino, who has been attending Republican conventions since 1984, and was president and chief executive of the 2008 convention in St. Paul, recalled a particular problem in 1996. The Republicans met in San Diego that year, and the convention center\u2019s ceilings were just 25 feet high, making a traditional balloon drop unfeasible. Instead, engineers shot balloons into the air from cannons. Ms. Cino said it was \u201ca bit of a nightmare.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we would do that again,\u201d she said.Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton, said scenes from this year\u2019s Republican convention could mirror the protests and riots seen outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. That year, the Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, tried to maintain some semblance of order. Mr. Trump, in contrast, isn\u2019t too big on sober discourse.\u201cThere\u2019s an element of Trump that would just thrive if there was chaos going on outside the convention,\u201d Mr. Zelizer said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of his overall rambunctious style of politics. The more controversy, the more confrontation, the more it works to his advantage, the more people cover it.\u201dMr. DiPaula said the foremost concern for any convention planner is pulling off the week smoothly and safely.\u201cThe best feeling was when the convention was over and everybody was safe,\u201d Mr. DiPaula said. \u201cIt was a huge feeling of relief.\u201dDoes he think people\u2019s concerns about the safety at the Republican convention have been overblown? He paused. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s over,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this essay incompletely described Barack Obama\u2019s position when he spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.

{"Headline": "Tesla and Google Take Different Roads to Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Silicon Valley, where companies big and small are at work on self-driving cars, there have been a variety of approaches, and even some false starts.The most divergent paths may be the ones taken by Tesla, which is already selling cars that have some rudimentary self-driving functions, and Google, which is still very much in experimental mode.Google\u2019s initial efforts in 2010 focused on cars that would drive themselves, but with a person behind the wheel to take over at the first sign of trouble and a second technician monitoring the navigational computer.But Google decided to play down the vigilant-human approach after an experiment in 2013, when the company let some of its employees sit behind the wheel of the self-driving cars on their daily commutes.Engineers using onboard video cameras to remotely monitor the results were alarmed by what they observed \u2014 a range of distracted-driving behavior that included falling asleep.\u201cWe saw stuff that made us a little nervous,\u201d Christopher Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon University roboticist who directs the car project at Google, said at the time.The experiment convinced the engineers that it might not be possible to have a human driver quickly snap back to \u201csituational awareness,\u201d the reflexive response required for a person to handle a split-second crisis.So Google engineers chose another route, taking the human driver completely out of the loop. They created a fleet of cars without brake pedals, accelerators or steering wheels, and designed to travel no faster than 25 miles an hour.For good measure they added a heavy layer of foam to the front of their cars and a plastic windshield, should the car make a mistake. While not suitable for high-speed interstate road trips, such cars might one day be able to function as, say, robotic taxis in stop-and-go urban settings.At the soonest, Google says it hopes to put such vehicles on the market by 2019.\u201cSafety has been paramount for the Google self-driving car team from the very beginning,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, the artificial intelligence researcher who created the Google project. \u201cWe wanted it to be significantly safer to the point where there would be no accidents ever.\u201dSo far Google\u2019s robotic cars have largely succeeded, with just one slow-speed fender bender caused by the robotic driver.Still, no engineering consensus exists about the best path to vehicle autonomy. In and around Silicon Valley, at least 19 commercial self-driving efforts are underway, ranging from big carmakers like Nissan and Ford and technology giants like Google, Baidu and Apple, to shoestring operations like comma.ai.Significantly, Toyota, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, has not joined the rush to self-driving. It has established a research laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., that does not aim to make a car that drives itself, but instead a \u201cguardian angel\u201d \u2014 a computerized system that would take over only when the human driver made an error.Automotive engineers at work on autonomous vehicles refer to a design challenge they call \u201covertrust,\u201d the possibility that humans may not fully understand the limitations of the self-driving safety features they rely on.Tesla notes that Autopilot is meant only to assist drivers, not to replace them. And its onscreen warnings and owner\u2019s manual emphasize that drivers should remain vigilant and keep their hands on or near the wheel at all times.But in tempting its customers with a feature still so experimental that the company refers to it as a \u201cbeta\u201d test, Tesla has sped far ahead of the rest of the industry and in the public\u2019s perception of the state of self-driving technology.Like Mr. Brown, the company\u2019s customers tend to be technically knowledgeable and adventuresome types, who are not necessarily willing to wait for the go-slow approach taken by the rest of the industry. That includes one of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known engineers.\u201cBeta products shouldn\u2019t have such life-and-death consequences,\u201d said Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, who owns a Tesla Model S.Mr. Wozniak concedes he worries that the Autopilot feature might lead him to take his eyes off the road at the wrong moment. But that is a risk he is willing to run.\u201cEven though I might have a slight attention lapse at the exact wrong moment,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s easier to drive this way and not feel as tired.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oracle\u2019s $9.3 Billion Deal for NetSuite Will Bolster Its Cloud Offerings", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Evan M. Goldberg founded NetSuite in 1998, he did so with backing from his former boss, Lawrence J. Ellison, who started the software giant Oracle.On Thursday, their relationship came full circle as Oracle agreed to acquire NetSuite for $9.3 billion to beef up its cloud offerings.It made Oracle bigger, but it did not change its business model. About 5,000 PeopleSoft employees, close to half the company, were laid off in the following months.The NetSuite purchase, on the other hand, is at the heart of Oracle\u2019s fight to remake itself for the modern world of cloud computing, or providing accessing to vast computational resources over the internet. This transition has shaken up the software business for the last several years. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created markets worth billions, and older companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have struggled to change the way they make and sell their products.The deal also illustrates that, for all the reach and novelty of tech, Silicon Valley remains a very small place with long personal histories. Mr. Goldberg got the idea for NetSuite after conversations with Mr. Ellison about where else the internet might go. Down the hall was another rising star at Oracle, named Marc Benioff.Mr. Benioff started a company called Salesforce.com within weeks of NetSuite\u2019s start, also with backing from Mr. Ellison. Today, Salesforce is regarded as the leading company selling only cloud software, with a market capitalization of $55.7 billion.NetSuite\u2019s chief executive, Zachary Nelson, is a well-regarded leader who also worked at Oracle and is close to Mr. Ellison. NetSuite has held customer events at Mr. Ellison\u2019s Silicon Valley estate. He is likely to occupy a senior role at Oracle.Mr. Ellison, through personal and family holdings, owns more than 40 percent of NetSuite, which makes the deal to acquire it a phenomenal payday for a man who was already among the world\u2019s richest.NetSuite has more than 5,000 employees and specializes in accounting and other back-office e-commerce software, particularly for smaller businesses. It has also created online software for manufacturing that is akin to some of Oracle\u2019s software applications. But that online software is created, sold and serviced differently.Oracle has, for most of the last decade, bought cloud companies and spent big on remaking its engineering and sales staff for the cloud world. That has paid off some: In the last fiscal year, the company had $12.2 billion in core cloud software sales, an increase of 49 percent from fiscal 2014.That is enough to make Oracle one of the largest cloud companies, but it was still just 8 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Overall revenue shrank 3 percent last year, as demand for older products fell.It might have been worse. Giant tech companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard have endured sharp revenue drops as cloud computing becomes more important, and have struggled to cope in the new environment.Oracle has fared relatively well, in part because its core product, a powerful database used for financial and managerial work, is at the center of most major companies worldwide. Competitors are trying to sell more modern databases to replace Oracle, with relatively little success so far.\u201cOracle and NetSuite cloud applications are complementary, and will coexist in the marketplace forever,\u201d Mark Hurd, chief executive of Oracle, said in the statement.An Oracle special committee made up of independent directors led the process to sign a deal with NetSuite. The transaction is expected to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals and agreement by a majority of NetSuite\u2019s shareholders, not including shares owned by executives of NetSuite or anyone affiliated with Mr. Ellison.Shares of NetSuite surged to a level just below the deal price in early trading on Thursday and closed at $108.41.Advertisement"}

Songwriting rates paid by interactive streaming services like Spotify are now governed by a byzantine system that includes a division between what are known as mechanical and performance royalties for the same songs.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Sale to Verizon Ends an Era for a Web Pioneer", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo was the front door to the web for an early generation of internet users, and its services still attract a billion visitors a month.But the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterday\u2019s great idea, and Yahoo has now reached the end of the line as an independent company.The board of the Silicon Valley company has agreed to sell Yahoo\u2019s core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.That compares with Yahoo\u2019s peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is not expected to join Verizon, but she is due to receive a severance payout worth about $57 million, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.Verizon and Yahoo declined to comment on the deal.Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.For a long time, the model worked. It seemed as if every company in America \u2014 and across much of the world \u2014 wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured into Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival required a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancies, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.Ms. Mayer, who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief executive four years ago but failed to halt its decline, was nevertheless rewarded handsomely for her efforts. Including the severance, she will have received cash and stock compensation worth about $218 million during her time at Yahoo, according to Equilar\u2019s calculations.Created by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo was originally a hand-selected directory to the nascent World Wide Web, but it quickly expanded its ambitions.\u201cYahoo is where you start,\u201d Jeff Mallett, the company\u2019s first chief operating officer, explained during a 1996 interview with a job candidate, Dan Finnigan. Mr. Finnigan, now the chief executive of Jobvite, said that he was skeptical of Yahoo\u2019s quest to dominate every category of content, but he later joined the company to run its HotJobs division.Google, which emerged a few years later, used a superior, more automated approach to indexing the web. Under its first chief executive, Timothy Koogle, Yahoo struck a four-year deal with Google in June 2000 to make Google\u2019s search engine the default on its website. Yahoo\u2019s leaders also tried to buy Google but eventually settled on building their own search tool.While Google was singularly focused on search, Yahoo recast itself as a content company under its second chief executive, Terry Semel, who succeeded Mr. Koogle in 2001.Yahoo then went through two more chief executives and two interim bosses in about three years, before hiring Ms. Mayer, a former Google search executive and tech celebrity, in July 2012.Despite her acclaim, Ms. Mayer failed to resolve Yahoo\u2019s central problem: a lack of focus.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The Alibaba offering put pressure on Ms. Mayer to come up with a plan to distribute that windfall to shareholders and prove that her turnaround plan was working.\u201cShe knew she was holding a melting ice cube in her hand. Rather than focus on slowing down the rate it was melting, she said, \u2018Let\u2019s look three, four, five years out,\u2019\u201d said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Company, who has followed the company for a decade.Mr. Finnigan, the former Yahoo executive, said that in hindsight, the company tried to compete in so many areas that it was difficult to succeed.\u201cYou have to be Coke or Pepsi. You don\u2019t want to be RC Cola. They let a lot of these verticals become RC Cola,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a sad day for those Yahoos who tried as hard as they did to create value.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Before her senior year, she became a contestant in the Miss America beauty pageant, which she won in 1988.A trained violinist, Ms. Carlson was proud of her achievement, saying her victory proved the pageant was as interested in a contestant\u2019s intelligence as her looks.\u201cIt shows that I\u2019m not a bimbo, that I do have intelligence and that I do represent what every woman wants to be in this society, which is a career woman, and be respected for her intelligence,\u201d she said in January 1989.After graduating from Stanford, she worked for several local TV stations before becoming the host of the Saturday edition of CBS\u2019s third-place morning show, \u201cThe Early Show,\u201d in 2002.\u201cShe was very, very serious and competent and ambitious about doing journalism the way CBS News was known for,\u201d Victor Neufeld, an executive producer of \u201cThe Early Show,\u201d said on Wednesday.She joined Fox News\u2019 morning show \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d in 2006, co-hosting it for eight years.In 2009, Jon Stewart devoted a segment of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d to Ms. Carlson, showing clips of her saying she had to Google words like czar and ignoramus to learn their definitions. Mr. Stewart then detailed her stellar educational background, accused her of playing dumb for Fox\u2019s audience and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stash your I.Q. in an offshore account.\u201dMs. Carlson is married to Casey Close, a sports agent known for his tough negotiating style, and a roster of clients that includes Derek Jeter. The couple have two children.She has been upfront in discussing matters of sexism in the workplace.\u201cMost professional women I know have experienced sexual harassment,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo have I \u2014 a few times \u2014 and I never talked about it until now. If that seems surprising, it shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ve always considered myself a strong woman, not afraid to stand up for myself, but in the face of sexual harassment I was silent.\u201cAs the issue takes a prominent place in the headlines today, I sometimes feel guilty about my trepidation,\u201d Ms. Carlson continued. \u201cPerhaps I could have moved the conversation forward if I had come forth.\u201dA picture with an article on Thursday about the decision of the former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson to sue its chairman, Roger Ailes, omitted a credit.

Thanks to everyone who told us what they want to see. We received more than 2,500 emails.All over California, communities are grappling with a shortage of affordable housing.Is Airbnb part of the problem?The company is increasingly at odds with local governments in the state.Airbnb has resisted, accusing officials of overreaching.Now, Airbnb is in a legal battle with its hometown, San Francisco, which has brought up wrenching questions about inequality, neighborhood change and the free market.Founded inside a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a major local success story.But Airbnb has also become a focal point for anger at the tech industry \u2014 even more so than the Google buses that bring workers to jobs in Silicon Valley.Short-term rentals in San Francisco are being blamed, at least in part, for rising rents that are driving out longtime residents.Last year, Airbnb spent more than $8 million to defeat a ballot measure that would have limited rentals to no more than 75 nights a year.Last month, San Francisco supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that would fine Airbnb $1,000 per day for each host listed on its website who is not registered with the city.\u201cThis legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb,\u201d the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s this very visible sign of the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just of gentrification, but of how wide the disparity is between people who have opportunities and people who don\u2019t.\u201dWhen questioned by reporters about the state budget, which he signed this week, Governor Brown responded with a parable, Aesop\u2019s \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper.\u201dAesop, an ancient Greek fabulist, \u201chas some credibility,\u201d Mr. Brown said.That was one of the governor\u2019s less obscure literary references.Since returning to Sacramento in 2011 for a second stint as governor, he has quoted poets, religious scholars and biologists.He invoked the book of Genesis, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a king of Spain and \u201cThe Little Engine That Could\u201d all in the same 2013 speech.\u201cOver the mountain the little engine went \u2014 we are going to get over that mountain,\u201d he said, making an analogy to California\u2019s high-speed rail plan after quoting the children\u2019s book.The unusual source material has perplexed some analysts.But his literary breadth may also help reinforce his image as a wise, old \u2014 well, experienced (he\u2019s 78) \u2014 politician, who will keep his party\u2019s impulses to spend in check.During a speech last year about climate change, Mr. Brown said proudly that he was among the last politicians with a classics degree.\u201cIt does come in handy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause some of the same mistakes have been made over and over again.\u201dCalifornia Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.Advertisement"}

Caution Is Advised", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byThe New Health CareThe doctors assessed the quality of advice on the top sites returned from Google, Yahoo and Bing for searches on common health complaints \u2014 like \u201cchest pain\u201d or \u201cheadache.\u201dNo site they examined listed all the necessary symptoms so that a user could obtain an accurate triage \u2014 whether to rush to the emergency room, call the doctor or treat the condition at home. A third of the sites did not list any of the key symptoms. Among sites that checked any critical symptoms, four in 10 provided no triage advice.Diagnostic abilities were better for those problems reasonably treated at home, for which the top diagnosis was correct 40 percent of the time, or for those that are more common, for which the top diagnosis was correct 38 percent of the time.Tested apps gave correct triage advice 58 percent of the time, and at a higher rate for more serious problems requiring urgent care. One reason is that symptom checkers tend to be risk-averse. They\u2019re biased toward advising patients to seek professional care even when self-care is appropriate. Some of the apps tested always advise professional care, even for conditions that don\u2019t warrant it.Though it\u2019s far less convenient, talking to a medical professional may be a more likely route to accurate medical advice than using the internet or apps.

{"Headline": "Man vs. Machine", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistDavenport and Kirby make a strong case that as machine intelligence makes progress, humans will need to distinguish their skills: \u201cstepping up,\u201d or being smarter than machines at seeing the big picture; \u201cstepping aside,\u201d choosing jobs machines cannot do; \u201cstepping in,\u201d being the person who can be a bridge between machines and humans.These may be good options, but it is difficult to see how they would apply to a majority of the world\u2019s workers or in a political and economic system in which corporations have incentives to disempower employees. When discussing, for example, why despite advances in technology, the workweek hasn\u2019t gotten shorter, the authors point to economists who argue that we work more in order to consume more and psychologists who say we find work satisfying. Haunting this discussion is the fact that people have little choice as longer hours are imposed on them.The authors do appeal to businesses to augment human labor with technology, but such a strategy is likely to be applicable only to a very highly skilled work force. Technology disempowers workers not because of its bits and bytes but because of how our economy is set up. Without changing that reality, any path to rescue is likely to have little staying power, since the next round of ever-\u00adadvancing technology will come and sink that lifeboat, too.Rid\u2019s new book offers a detailed retelling of the early days of humanity\u2019s encounter with intelligent machines, emphasizing the social context and response to new technology from World War II to the present world of hacking, cyber-insecurity and looming dangers of autonomous warfare.The initial narrative is centered mostly on the ideas of the mathematician Norbert Wiener, who popularized the notion of a new age of computer-controlled systems but also came to worry that automation might be the \u201ceconomic equivalent of slave labor.\u201d He warned of mass unemployment and loss of human dignity, disagreeing with those who, like the mathematician Alice Mary Hilton, believed machines would herald a golden age \u201cfree of human drudgery.\u201dIt is easy to scoff at the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of technical visionaries of earlier eras, as Rid sometimes does. Their anxieties and grand hopes might seem extreme, but it may well be that we have grown complacent and shortsighted. As we enter an age of machine intelligence, we might take Wiener as an early, flawed prophet whose warnings we should heed (admittedly with the benefit of grounded and realistic analyses). Rid\u2019s book offers a useful history as well as a chance to re-examine our current technological crossroads.This survey of the legal and policy landscape around the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in the digital age reads as a painful reminder of why laws that were developed before the invention of photography and sound recording fall short when we consider dignity and privacy today.In his 2009 book \u201cDelete,\u201d Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger warned that digital networks could \u201cforever tether us to all our past actions, making it impossible, in practice, to escape them.\u201d Jones reminds us that this tether is not automatic but a \u201cstructure of discoverability\u201d that can be altered. For example, in 2014, Europe\u2019s highest court ruled that individuals could ask Google to have negative information removed or \u201cdelisted\u201d from search results. What we need, Jones argues, is not complete erasure but \u201cdigital redemption,\u201d as in the way American bankruptcy laws allow people in debt to start over. Applied to our digital lives, such measures would keep us from being eternally haunted by an embarrassing photograph or ill-advised tweet.The book leaves us wanting more in the way of suggested regulations, but by laying out the terrain so thoughtfully, and highlighting the concepts that should guide our actions, Jones has created the groundwork for a much needed conversation on the profound problem of permanent digital ballasts in the 21st century.To computer scientists, \u201calgorithm\u201d means a well-\u00adordered set of steps to achieve a particular goal. An everyday example might be the algorithm to tie your shoelaces: Hold one lace tightly, make a loop with the other. Do you have a computer file that is a long, unordered list that must be sorted? A need to handle a lot of records that don\u2019t fit into the memory, or run a lot of programs simultaneously? There\u2019s an algorithm (or two or three or more) for that. In this nuanced introduction, Christian and Griffiths do a fine job of explaining basic sorting and optimization algorithms used in computer science \u2014 along with their weaknesses.The book delves deeper when it claims to show how these tools can solve everyday problems, from the trivial to the profound. I found the examples fascinating, but the computer science algorithms felt more easily applicable to simpler problems (how to seat everyone at a wedding to maximize pleasant company) rather than the more complex questions (how to decide whom to marry).As software only becomes ever more sophisticated and powerful \u2014 deciding who might get hired or fired, given a loan or denied, convicted or paroled \u2014 perhaps the most important function of this entertaining and educational book is in revealing the limiting assumptions, narrow boundaries and tight restrictions of algorithms, and how different they can be from the messy world of humans.Zeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a contributing opinion writer for The Times.Advertisement"}

For NextVR, which specializes in streaming live sports events in virtual reality, the deal helped it expand its offerings, said David Cramer, NextVR\u2019s executive vice president for corporate strategy.Universal Music Group, which puts out music by Kanye West and Taylor Swift among others, and iHeartMedia announced a similar partnership in January.\u201cTo their credit, U.M.G. has been extremely open to experimenting with this new platform, which makes them the perfect partner,\u201d John Sykes, president of iHeartMedia Entertainment Enterprises, said in an email.Interest in the technology is outpacing actual VR music products, however, and few virtual reality performances have been released. Despite originally announcing a plan for six to 10 virtual reality experiences this year, Mr. Sykes said iHeartMedia was focused on bringing at least one virtual reality element to its annual music festival in September.And NextVR has released only a single song, \u201cA Sky Full of Stars,\u201d from the Coldplay concert. Mr. Cramer said that NextVR was compiling a lineup of acts for filming, to be released this summer.Distribution has been slow because the music industry is waiting for the virtual reality ecosystem to catch up, according to Ben Lang, a co-founder and executive editor of Road to VR, an publication that covers the virtual reality industry. \u201cA lot of these deals are strategic announcements to ward off other companies and show market leadership,\u201d he said.One setback has been logistical: It is still a challenge to get virtual reality viewers into consumers\u2019 hands. Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR allow users to view free content on their mobile devices. Higher-end gear, like the $600 Oculus Rift and the $800 HTC Vive, both released this year, offer more enhanced viewing. The $400 Sony PlayStation VR will introduce virtual reality to video game consoles this summer.\u201cThe number of VR headsets out there does not justify filming an entire concert series,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201cYou definitely don\u2019t want to put out your content before people are ready to view it.\u201dDespite the lag, technology start-ups like Vrtify continue to produce virtual reality content, waiting for the public to catch up.The company has worked with Florence and the Machine, Mumford and Sons and Sting, producing virtual reality content from their live performances for its platform. Vrtify introduced a beta version of its platform in January, and plans to release the platform in October.Instead of finding a partner in the music industry, Vrtify sought to work with artists and music publishers to obtain the rights to songs on its platform.An article on Tuesday about virtual reality music projects misidentified the company that releases music by Kanye West, Taylor Swift and others and is in a partnership with iHeartMedia to produce music in virtual reality. It is the Universal Music Group, not the Universal Media Group. The article also erroneously included an artist among those whose music Universal Music Group releases.

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley of Space Start-Ups? It Could Be Seattle", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside an office in this city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby.There\u2019s more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle\u2019s abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.\u201cThe reason for it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don\u2019t seem to want to move to L.A.\u201d\u201cAbandoned in Place,\u201d a new book of photographs by Roland Miller, finds haunting beauty in derelict launch pads, rusting towers and other detritus of the American space race.One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun\u2019s energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won\u2019t say how much they\u2019ve invested.\u201cMany of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,\u201d said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s director of marketing and business development.Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in which Boeing is based. It is Chicago, not Seattle. (Though the company moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001, about half of its workforce is still in Seattle.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo Is Said to Collect Final Bids as Auction Nears Its End", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The gavel is finally poised to drop in the drawn-out auction for Yahoo\u2019s core internet business.Final bids for the services, which include Yahoo\u2019s search, email, advertising and media operations, are due Monday, with the board set to make a decision soon afterward, according to people briefed on the process who asked for anonymity because the bidding was confidential.The sale of Yahoo\u2019s business would close out a largely unsuccessful four-year effort by Marissa Mayer, the company\u2019s chief executive, to turn around the internet company. Although Yahoo was once the place where many web users began their wanderings, it fell on hard times over the last decade through a series of strategic and managerial missteps. Although Yahoo\u2019s properties still draw more than one billion visitors a month, the company accounts for a tiny slice of the time people spend online.The bidders for Yahoo\u2019s operations include the telecommunications giants Verizon Communications and AT&T, several private equity firms and a Quicken Loans co-founder, Dan Gilbert, who is getting financial backing from Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.The offers are expected to vary depending on what assets are included, but Wall Street expects the business to fetch as much as $6 billion, including intellectual property and land.Though several bidders have acknowledged running into what one called \u201chairy\u201d issues, nothing has emerged as a deal breaker. People involved in the auction describe it as competitive.Any sale of Yahoo has been slowed by a trickle of unpleasant revelations to bidders about expensive decisions made by Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was named Yahoo\u2019s chief in July 2012.The biggest surprise: In late June, Yahoo told bidders that they could be on the hook for more than $1 billion in immediate payments to Mozilla, the company that makes the Firefox web browser.In a 2014 deal, Yahoo promised to pay Mozilla at least $375 million a year to make Yahoo the default search engine on Firefox \u2014 about $100 million a year more than Alphabet\u2019s Google unit was then paying for similar prominence, according to Yahoo and Mozilla filings.To sweeten the deal, Ms. Mayer personally negotiated a provision that gave Mozilla unusual leverage to demand all of remaining payments upfront if Yahoo were sold, according to people briefed on the terms of the contract.To demand the payout, Mozilla would have to show that the change in ownership was hurting the Mozilla brand and degrading the search experience, according to one of the people briefed on the terms. If Mozilla switched to another search provider instead, Yahoo would only have to make up the difference between its $375 million annual guarantee and the fee paid by Mozilla\u2019s new partner.The deal\u2019s provisions put pressure on any winning bidder to continue Ms. Mayer\u2019s heavy investments in search, which she has championed despite the long odds of success against Google. About 42 percent of Yahoo\u2019s $5 billion in revenue last year came from search.Yahoo decided the contract\u2019s provisions were not significant enough to disclose to shareholders, despite a series of letters last year from the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the company to lay out the terms of the agreement and the risks to Yahoo. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the dispute.A Yahoo spokeswoman, Rebecca Neufeld, declined to comment on the Mozilla contract or the broader sale process.Denelle Dixon-Thayer, the chief legal and business officer of Mozilla, said she could not discuss specific terms of the Yahoo contract because of a confidentiality clause, but she acknowledged that Mozilla had protected itself from \u201cdownside risk.\u201dMs. Dixon-Thayer said that when Mozilla switched to Yahoo from Google in 2014, its priority was making sure there was viable competition in search.\u201cThe most important thing to us is a focus on search, a focus on improving and building a search product that we can all be proud of,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to and want to see more innovation in search.\u201dBidders are also trying to determine how much they would have to pay out in severance if they cut staff. As of March 31, Yahoo had 9,400 employees, excluding those already scheduled to be laid off this year.Ms. Mayer and the board have handed out hefty stock awards to keep Yahoo employees from jumping ship over the last year and a half as the company has repeatedly shifted strategies.As of March 31, Yahoo had 35.5 million unvested restricted stock units outstanding. At the company\u2019s current stock price, those have a value of more than $1.3 billion. The company also had 5.4 million stock options outstanding.Yahoo\u2019s top four executives alone, including Ms. Mayer, would collectively receive about $100 million, including two years of stock awards, if they were fired. Rank-and-file employees would get their next six months of stock awards accelerated, and middle managers would get 12 months to 18 months.Brian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, estimates that Yahoo\u2019s operating business is worth $3.5 billion, but he said that whatever the final price, the sale would have little impact on Yahoo\u2019s stock price, which has already risen this year on speculation of a deal.\u201cInvestors just don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.Once any deal is announced, investors will turn their attention to the biggest issue affecting the stock: How will the remaining stub of Yahoo make money from its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company with a face value of $31 billion, and its 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, worth about $9 billion? That process, fraught with complex tax and legal issues, could itself take many months.Advertisement"}

Tesla says audio and visual alerts warn drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and watch the road. If a driver is unresponsive to the alerts, the car is programmed to slow itself to a stop.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should study how automakers can minimize driver distraction. This will become more urgent as advanced systems become available in cars made for the mass market.The agency does not yet have regulations for driverless cars or cars that have driver assistance systems. But when officials do put rules in place, they will have to update them regularly as they learn about how the technology works in practice. Automation should save lives.

{"Headline": "The Agony of the Digital Tease", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byCommand ZThere was the breadcrumb dropped on Valentine\u2019s Day, by the ex-girlfriend of my friend. The two women hadn\u2019t spoken in months, after a prolonged breakup, and the ex was now seeing somebody new.Yet there she was, on the day of Hallmark-themed romance, \u201cliking\u201d my friend\u2019s Instagram photo \u2026 from three weeks ago. Which meant she had to have been scrolling through her feed.There was the friend, a digital strategist who, every few days, would receive a \u201csup\u201d from a recruiter, except that the recruiter would never set up a time to meet. Once, my friend returned to his desk to find a \u201cfailed Google hangout\u201d notification from this person, to which the recruiter later messaged to apologize for the \u201cbutt dial.\u201d My friend Victor Pineiro asked: \u201cWas this a new recruiting tactic? Or just specific to this guy?\u201dI\u2019ve had my own share of breadcrumbers: the editor at the publication where I was vying for a job who repeatedly viewed my LinkedIn page (which I could see) but never messaged me; the guy I went out with a couple of times who continued to text me every few weeks to \u201ccheck in\u201d months after we stopped seeing each other.Alicia Winokur, a recent graduate of Mount Holyoke College, said: \u201cThe worst type of breadcrumber is the one who resurfaces every six months, and like the Loch Ness monster, you almost can\u2019t believe this creature has come back into your life. But there he is, saying, \u2018Hey, I was just thinking about you.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a meerkat poking its head up,\u201d she added. \u201cBut not nearly as cute.\u201dFor anyone who\u2019s ever dated, or maintained any kind of relationship, in the digital age, you have probably known a breadcrumber. They communicate via sporadic noncommittal, but repeated messages \u2014 or breadcrumbs \u2014 that are just enough to keep you wondering but not enough to seal the deal (whatever that deal may be).Breadcrumbers check in consistently with a romantic prospect, but never set up a date. They pique your interest, of that prospective job, perhaps, by reminding you repeatedly that it exists, but never set up the interview.\u201cIt really is a cousin of the \u2018friend zone,\u2019\u201d said Rachel Simmons, an author and leadership coach at Smith College. \u201cIt\u2019s about relegating a person to a particular dead end, but one that still keeps them hanging on in some way.\u201dThe breadcrumbs we\u2019re talking about do the opposite. They lead you astray.Among the different types of breadcrumbers: link-baiters, who try to entice you with a text message of a URL, but without providing any context or setup; bitmojiers, or their cousins, snapchatters, who, rather than communicate with actual words, prefer to remain ambiguous with an exaggerated cartoon of themselves holding up a sign that says, \u201cLOL.\u201d (LOL to what, though?)\u201cGod forbid you say \u2018How are you?\u2019\u201d said Hilary Campbell, an illustrator in Brooklyn and the victim of a Bitmoji breadcrumber.There are creepers, who peep your social media pages but never make contact, even when they know that you know they have viewed your page; there are zombies, who re-emerge from the dead, so to speak, after months of no correspondence; and there are text bubblers, or those who type a message, stop, begin typing again and then stop, creating a specific kind of digital hell.\u201cMy brother breadcrumbs me constantly,\u201d said Libby Leffler, a graduate student in Boston. \u201cHe\u2019ll send me random links on Reddit and then disappear. Sometimes in response I am like, \u2018Did you die?\u2019 \u2018Do I need to file a missing person\u2019s report?\u2019\u201dLike most of today\u2019s torturous microcommunications, we have technology to thank for breadcrumbs. Sure, they may have existed a decade ago (a nod on the street, a \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d in the hallway \u2014 these were technically breadcrumbs, right?) but they didn\u2019t have quite the same \u201cdesperate wondering about what someone means,\u201d Ms. Simmons said.In a dating context, this can be particularly complex. There\u2019s breadcrumbing when you\u2019ve broken up with someone but you don\u2019t want to let them go; there\u2019s breadcrumbing as a way of keeping a dating prospect on \u201chold\u201d (what Ms. Turkle calls \u201cactivated but not active\u201d). Or there\u2019s breadcrumbing as a kind of game: when a person is \u201cnot interested in you, but interested in themselves staying relevant to you,\u201d as Ms. Campbell said.Rest assured, though, there are ways to beat breadcrumbers at their own game.Sara Wilson, who works in social media marketing in Los Angeles, said she has developed a methodology for identifying a breadcrumber. It\u2019s centered upon a few key phrases she calls \u201clazy to the power of 100,\u201d which include:\u201cYo\u201d\u201cFun night?\u201d\u201cHa\u201d\u201cSup\u201d\u201cNice\u201d\u201chey stranger\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like the digital equivalent of a sneeze,\u201d she said.Or, one may take the approach of Ms. Leffler. \u201cWhenever people are breadcrumbish to me, I always reply to them with less words than they send me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if they were like, \u2018sounds good,\u2019 I would respond with \u2018thumbs up.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Department Won\u2019t Alter Music Industry Royalty Rules", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byThe music industry sent a wish list to Washington, but the response was not quite what it had expected.Two years ago, Ascap and BMI, the industry\u2019s two giant licensing clearinghouses, petitioned the Justice Department for changes to the regulatory agreements that have governed them since 1941. Those documents have not been changed in at least 15 years and, the agencies said, were in desperate need of updating to preserve the value of music in the digital age. The request came after both groups went through bruising litigation with Pandora Media over royalty rates.But this week the government told the agencies it planned to deny their request, and added a twist that songwriters and industry executives say could further damage the economics of music and perhaps unsettle the business in fundamental ways.In a meeting in Washington on Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers told representatives of Ascap and BMI that the two groups, called performing rights organizations, must adopt a policy known as \u201c100 percent licensing,\u201d which means that any party that controls a part of a composition can issue a license for the use of the whole thing. This went against decades of industry practice.Although the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation carries great weight, any alterations to the consent decrees is subject to approval by two federal judges overseeing the cases, and the performing rights organizations could object to the changes in court.Music publishers said that instituting 100 percent licensing would further depress royalty rates by letting outlets like radio stations and digital music services shop for whatever party would accept the lowest fee. It would also cause administrative pandemonium, at least in the short term, they said, and cast doubt on the futures of Ascap and BMI, two of the music world\u2019s most stable institutions, together processing more than $2 billion a year in licensing fees.\u201cTheir decision is like Brexit,\u201d said Martin Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV, the largest publisher. \u201cNo one understands it.\u201dThe Justice Department\u2019s meeting with Ascap and BMI was confirmed by those organizations, which issued a brief joint statement on Thursday saying that they were \u201cevaluating the information presented.\u201d The regulators are expected to meet with publishers and digital music services next week and issue a public decision by the end of July, according to several people briefed on the talks who were not authorized to speak about them. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.The decision, if upheld by the courts, could have consequences for songwriters. Those who work alone and control their intellectual property would gain an advantage. Major pop hits now tend to involve many songwriters, but the ranks of credited writers could be thinned to limit the number of people who could potentially license the work, publishing executives said.It could also mean that musicians would be forced to change their writing habits based on the professional affiliations of their collaborators, said Michelle Lewis, a songwriter whose work has been recorded by pop stars like Cher and Jessica Simpson, and who is a founder of the advocacy group Songwriters of North America.\u201cYou write with who you have chemistry with; their choice of P.R.O. should not figure into it,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut if we have to deal with this administrative nightmare we are not going to collaborate. I don\u2019t think the D.O.J. really understood this.\u201dWhen the Justice Department indicated last year that it was considering 100 percent licensing, it caused an uproar in the industry. In January, Maria A. Pallante, the register of copyrights and the director of the United States Copyright Office, wrote a 30-page memo saying that the practice \u201cwould seemingly vitiate important principles of copyright law.\u201dYet the Justice Department\u2019s position on 100 percent licensing has been endorsed by technology companies, which have long argued that the music industry charges onerous fees for use of their material. In a federal rate-setting trial two years ago involving Ascap and Pandora, a judge also warned that Ascap and music publishers had shown a \u201ctroubling coordination\u201d in how they operate, giving fuel to technology companies\u2019 complaints about the music industry.\u201cCongress is clear in the Copyright Act that each individual co-writer is authorized to license the whole,\u201d said Gregory Barnes, the general counsel of the Digital Media Association, a trade group that includes tech giants like Pandora, Amazon and Google. \u201cCongress created that rule to promote efficiency.\u201dIn the past, major music publishers like Universal and Sony/ATV have said they will withdraw their works entirely from Ascap and BMI if the consent decrees are not changed to their satisfaction, but it was not clear on Thursday whether they would follow through. Mr. Bandier said that Sony/ATV was still coming to grips with the situation.Elizabeth Matthews, the chief executive of Ascap, said her organization was \u201cdisappointed and frustrated,\u201d and considering \u201clegal and legislative remedies.\u201d\u201cAn approach that creates confusion, chaos and instability in the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Matthews said, \u201cis detrimental to all creators, publishers and music users.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Hands Grip the Wheel Now, but Financial Autopilot Is Coming", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byEssayI love tech but it scares me. Every year it seems to be taking over another part of my life.Soon it may be controlling my finances. It\u2019s already taking over my driving.Still, sooner or later, I end up giving in and using whatever technology is offered because of \u2014 convenience! I tell myself, \u201cDon\u2019t be such a big baby!\u201dMapping software is something I\u2019m willing to use. The problem, though, as with pretty much all tech, is that it is just good enough to lull me into relying on it, but not always trustworthy enough to make that a wise choice. When I was trying to take my older son to the Motor Vehicle Commission office in Wayne, N.J., one Saturday morning a couple of years ago, Apple Maps sent me to a spot on a small residential road. You have arrived!Angry and confused, I drove up a bit to make a safe U-turn, and on my way back to civilization, as I passed the spot where I had stopped, I saw another car, the driver clearly wondering why the phone had just told him he had arrived at his destination. How many people each day was the app sending to that spot? Were Apple engineers sitting back in Cupertino, watching us all on some sort of GPS-equipped monitor, sniggering at our consternation? Did they think \u201c2001\u201d was a comedy? I suspect so.I have switched to Google Maps, which has been better, though not perfect. And I review my route before I drive. But ever since Google bought Waze, a live traffic data app, in 2013, Google Maps has become increasingly aggressive about telling me that there is an alternate route that will be even faster than the one I\u2019m on.Here\u2019s my most recent example: A few weeks ago, my wife and I drove out on a long weekend to see our younger son in Iowa. (We do this sort of thing. We\u2019re Texans. And our car gets 37 miles per gallon.) I let my phone tell me how to get there. The trip to Iowa should be easy. Interstate 280 runs three blocks from our home. It joins Interstate 80 a few miles west. Get on I-80 and, 1,000 miles later, turn left at Iowa City.It didn\u2019t work out that way. On the second morning, the app abruptly told me to get off I-80 and switch to a state road running parallel to it. It turned out that a tanker had overturned the night before and was burning; the highway had been shut down in both directions.When we finally returned to an open stretch of highway, we knew we had gotten good advice \u2014 the program knew what was ahead before we did.On the way back, though, Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic highway signs started warning us about reduced traffic lanes about 100 miles before we got to the slowdown. Consider alternate routes, the signs told us. Fine, if you know any!Suddenly, Google offered one: Get off 20 miles ahead of the jam and navigate around it. Or so it seemed. Gripping the steering wheel tightly, I decided to trust the app. In front of me was a car with New York plates, behind me a car with Connecticut plates. We were the tristate detour squad! We followed the twists and winds of narrow roads through farmland, past cows and goats and corn cribs full to bursting. It was scenic. It was very long. Were we saving time? We couldn\u2019t tell. But we were moving.We rejoined the line of cars as the jam was breaking up, and continued to drive almost in formation for the rest of the way across Pennsylvania.So I am accommodating myself to the world of software that guides me though my road trips. But what about software for my finances? I\u2019m still resisting it, yet software for money is everywhere.Many programs are aimed at those app-happy millennials.That\u2019s where my hands grip the wheel tightly again. I can fix a bad detour while I\u2019m driving by wandering around for a while and, as the apps tell us, \u201creturn to the route.\u201d But being steered wrong with my retirement funds is a lot harder to recover from. One bad move and I\u2019ll be eating Hamburger Helper until I die.What scares me is the realization that computers are already making big incursions into my financial life.My software-generated 401(k) statements remind me that it\u2019s time to rebalance my portfolio to include more bonds, though it\u2019s not telling me which ones to get. Yet. I assume that will be coming before long, and, eventually, I will be listening.Of course, human brokers do plenty of terrible things. And when a human helped me at Vanguard, he was probably just telling me what his computer told him about my investments.At some point, I expect, software will be telling me what to invest in. As will happen in so many other industries, the human advisers will have been laid off, and the artificial intelligence bot will be my only option. I\u2019ll talk to it, because by then I will have been laid off, too, replaced by a joke-writing computer, the Rickles 9000. I will be so lonely.Or, just maybe, the software will do right by me. In any case, I expect that someday I will go on autopilot, trusting a machine to manage my money completely. It couldn\u2019t do much worse than I have.So long as it doesn\u2019t leave me in Wayne, N.J.An essay in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday, about misgivings over robo-investing, misidentified the automated investment service that suspended trading after the British vote to leave the European Union. It is Betterment, not Wealthfront.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tesla Experiment: Drive, It Said", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byLettersDefenders and skeptics discuss an Autopilot system that recently led to a fatality.That said, the effort to develop an autonomous self-driving car is a worthy exercise. Adaptive cruise control, lane change warnings and automatic braking triggered by obstruction sensors are just a few of the features that will make driving safer even if we never reach the driverless end state. As Tesla, Google, Volvo and the others work to take the human element (and all of its inherent weaknesses \u2014 distractions, slow reflexes, declining vision and hearing) out of the driving equation, accidents will no doubt be reduced, and many, such as rear-end collisions, may be eliminated.ROBERT CHECCHIODunellen, N.J.I live in the Boston area, where driving is chaotic, unruly and often bewilderingly rude \u2014 but at least there is a person behind the wheel who can correct such excesses quickly. If self-driving vehicles can\u2019t read the nuances of snow, flooded roads or other weather conditions, just one of the problems your article mentions, that alone makes them dangerous. Several thousand pounds of metal piloted by technology incapable of adjusting for nuance or unusual situations seems like a recipe for avoidable disasters. SALLY PEABODYMedford, Mass.To the Editor: In the wake of the Tesla Autopilot fatality and continuing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation, Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle make the important, if perhaps self-evident, point that self-driving cars must be certified safe before public use. The real question for policy makers, however, is what constitutes an appropriately \u201csafe\u201d autonomous vehicle. Our current transportation system exacts a terrible toll: More than 35,000 people died on American roads in 2015, an almost 8 percent increase over 2014, and the system is almost completely dependent on petroleum, constraining American foreign policy and exposing our servicemen and women to conflict.Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce traffic fatalities, expand mobility access to millions, and enhance national and economic security by building a fuel-diverse transportation system. These benefits compel the deployment of autonomous vehicles once their safety matches today\u2019s cars with all their flaws. Imposing excessive regulation and barriers to deployment runs contrary to the national interest.ROBBIE DIAMOND and AMITAI Y. BIN-NUNWashingtonAs a psychiatrist who appreciates how sophisticated the brain is, I would argue that safe driving is no doubt enhanced by some technology. However, we risk losing ourselves \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 in becoming overly reliant on technology. Energy, time and money would be better spent teaching youths the dangers of using technology while driving rather than chasing a grandiose dream.LARRY S. SANDBERGNew YorkTo the Editor: The core of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot problem is no different from what we have been facing in cockpit automation. When something nonroutine and unthinkable happens, it is up to the human operator to intervene, take over and save the day. Of course this could be a challenge as he or she has been out of the loop, removed from active, hands-on control of the system, and can also be suffering from lack of situational awareness and skill atrophy. Air France and Asiana crashes in 2009 and 2013, respectively, are sober reminders of the perils of automation. It was Chesley B. Sullenberger\u2019s intervention and improvisation that safely landed a crippled US Airways plane in the Hudson River in 2009, saving the lives of 155 people.Tesla\u2019s not making \u201cdetails of the accident public for nearly two months \u2014 and then not until regulators announced their inquiries\u201d \u2014 possibly for public relations reasons, is unconscionable. Tesla, its enthusiastic \u201cbrand evangelist\u201d drivers and its boss, Elon Musk, should note what the Nobel physicist Richard P. Feynman said in the context of another technological system failure, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986: \u201cFor a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.\u201dNAJMEDIN MESHKATILos AngelesThe writer, a professor of engineering and aviation safety at the University of Southern California, was involved in studies of a G.M. concept car in the mid-1990s.If you are contemplating a self-driving car, be very, very careful. It will take many more years before it is really reliable in all real-life situations. It\u2019s cool technology, for sure, but it might kill you, as it did my friend. My heart aches for him.IVAR WOLDMoultonborough, N.H.The federal safety standard mandating this vehicle-to-vehicle communications system has been developed. It\u2019s just been stuck for months in the bureaucratic review process. Meanwhile, there are efforts underway at the Federal Communications Commission that would at best delay (and at worst, completely derail) the deployment of the lifesaving technologies. Powerful interests want to seize this safety spectrum currently allocated for intelligent transportation systems. The government should put safety first. Get the safety standard out, and then look at ways to share spectrum that don\u2019t interfere with lifesaving technology.JOHN BOZZELLAPresident and Chief Executive, Association of Global AutomakersWashingtonTo the Editor: Tesla gets put under the magnifying glass for a single event, while the same technology has prevented numerous accidents. Some of them have been documented by Tesla owners\u2019 dashboard cameras.While Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system can be operated hands-free, it does require the driver to grasp the steering wheel every few minutes to ensure that the driver is still engaged. Drivers must be ready to take over at a moment\u2019s notice. It is no longer possible to leave the driver\u2019s seat while Autopilot is in use.No safety technology is 100 percent effective. But given that Tesla\u2019s vehicle fleet has logged over 130 million miles with Autopilot turned on, the statistics look promising, even with one tragic fatality. The biggest risk lies in overconfidence on the part of some Tesla drivers \u2014 the assumption that Autopilot will save them from any situation. While it\u2019s cool to think of Autopilot as \u201cautonomous,\u201d it is really just a driver\u2019s aid. A pilot is still required.TODD R.

{"Headline": "Forget Beanbag Chairs. Amazon Is Giving Its Workers Treehouses.", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byNo, Amazon is growing actual plants, more than 3,000 species of them spread around a one-acre greenhouse a half-hour\u2019s drive from Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle. There are carnivorous pitcher plants, exotic philodendrons and orchids from Ecuador that resemble the menacing flora from \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d\u201cCinnamon, wax candy and baby powder,\u201d said Ron Gagliardo, the Amazon horticulturist who oversees the greenhouse, when asked to describe the mysterious scent of the orchid, called Anguloa virginalis.Amazon pioneered internet shopping, electronic book reading and cloud computing. Now, as it enters adulthood, it is applying some of that inventiveness to its new home. The company is constructing a collection of high-rise and low-rise buildings in downtown Seattle that will be arrayed around three striking transparent, conjoined structures that Amazon calls spheres. They will act as high-tech greenhouses, the kind of flashy architecture that Amazon shunned for the first 22 years of its life.The real point of the spheres is how Amazon wants to use the nature on the inside to inspire employees. When they open in early 2018, the spheres will be packed with a plant collection worthy of top-notch conservatories, allowing Amazon employees to amble through tree canopies three stories off the ground, meet with colleagues in rooms with walls made from vines and eat kale Caesar salads next to an indoor creek.Since Amazon decided about a decade ago to stay in downtown Seattle, the company said, it has invested over $4 billion in the construction and development of offices in the city, though it won\u2019t disclose the budget for the spheres. The spheres will be accessible to Amazon employees only, but the company may eventually allow public tours.\u201cThe whole idea was to get people to think more creatively, maybe come up with a new idea they wouldn\u2019t have if they were just in their office,\u201d said Dale Alberda, the lead architect on the project at NBBJ, a firm that has also worked on building projects for Samsung, Google and the Chinese internet company Tencent.What makes Amazon\u2019s project unusual is its location \u2014 in the heart of a city, rather than on a sprawling suburban campus of the sort favored by most other big tech companies. Amazon, the largest private employer in Seattle, has more than 20,000 employees spread out in more than 30 buildings in the city. Its current construction plans will give it the space to more than double its local head count.Mr. Bezos has said that Amazon is staying put in a city because the kinds of employees it wants are attracted to an urban environment. But the concrete and steel canyons around Amazon\u2019s new downtown properties do not have a lot of greenery. That is where the spheres and Mr. Gagliardo, whom Amazon hired to fill them with plants, enter the picture.Margaret O\u2019Mara, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington, sees the spheres as a kind of Walden Pond under glass. \u201cIt\u2019s a retreat, a cathedral away from the hubbub of the city,\u201d she said.There was plenty of noise inside the spheres on a recent tour, as workers welded steel, pounded bolts into place and sawed concrete inside the half-built structure. The glass panels that make up the carapace of the spheres were being lowered onto steel supports in eye-catching shapes.Wearing a hard hat, Mr. Gagliardo dodged power cords and scaffolding, surveying an enormous mass of concrete where a five-story living wall \u2014 fabric pockets filled with plants \u2014 will eventually be installed. He pointed to where a glass roof panel will be removed and a 45-foot fig tree will be lifted by crane into one of the spheres, one of 40 to 50 trees that will be installed.\u201cBeing able to walk through here, I\u2019m starting to see where things are going to go,\u201d he said.The spheres will have meeting areas called treehouses, and suspension bridges high off the ground that will be just wobbly enough to quicken the pulses of employees who walk over them. \u201cAmazon said, \u2018Make this fun,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Alberda, the architect.Amazon\u2019s architects had to make the spheres welcoming for both plants and people, a space with the abundance of a conservatory but without the stickiness that will fog MacBook screens and make people sweat.During the day, Amazon will keep the spheres at 72 degrees and 60 percent humidity, while at night the temperature will average 55 degrees and the humidity 85 percent, which Mr. Gagliardo said would be optimal for the cloud forest plant specimens it has collected.A growing body of academic research points to the benefits of giving employees access to nature. About a decade ago, Ihab Elzeyadi, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, conducted a study in which workers who were provided with a view of nature experienced a 20 percent reduction in sick leave from their employer, though it was not clear why that happened.Dr. Elzeyadi said he was intrigued by Amazon\u2019s sphere project, but not convinced it would be as effective as letting workers gaze at plants from their desks.\"You\u2019re making a big investment and betting on two big hypotheses,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they leave work and go there and, having that kind of nature-bathing maybe once a week, will it really impact their stress levels?\u201dUntil plants start moving into the spheres next spring, Mr. Gagliardo, 50, dotes on them in their temporary home in the huge greenhouse Amazon has been leasing for the last couple of years. He will continue to tend to the plants for Amazon after they are planted in the spheres.He stops by a welwitschia, a Namibian plant with two leaves, proclaiming it the \u201cugliest plant in the world\u201d and delivering the line with such enthusiasm that it sounds like a compliment. With misters pumping water into the air, he swells with excitement discussing his current love affair with a group of begonias from Southeast Asia.\u201cNext week I\u2019ll be more excited about a different group,\u201d he said.Many of the species Amazon is growing here are endangered or extinct in the wild, acquired from botanical gardens, universities and private growers around the world. Mr. Gagliardo, who previously worked at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and in amphibian conservation, said opportunities to build a plant collection like Amazon\u2019s did not come along often.\u201cI\u2019m a plant curator by heart,\u201d he said. \u201cSo different plant families, amassing a collection of plants, is totally what I geek out on and go crazy about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Verizon and Yahoo: Internet Also-Rans With Big Hopes", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsVerizon is continuing to invest in ancient web history. The telecom company on Monday said it was paying $4.8 billion to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business. It effectively justifies rival T-Mobile\u2019s tongue-in-cheek claim earlier this year that Verizon is having a midlife crisis. The Verizon boss, Lowell McAdam, after all, is betting the deal will help attract digital advertisers by meshing the internet-search firm with AOL, another 1990s highflier that Verizon bought last year.It is an appealing idea. Yahoo brings with it not just its search and advertising units, but also content like sports and finance that could play well with AOL\u2019s assets like The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. Verizon will also get its hands on Yahoo\u2019s 600 million monthly mobile users.Yahoo shareholders, though, have an exceptionally gloomy view of the business. It does not help that the division\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, is likely to be just $770 million this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from $2 billion a decade ago. But investors do not even reckon the units being sold are worth anything. The overall company has around $5 billion in net cash and owns stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that are worth some $41 billion, yet Yahoo\u2019s market value is just $37 billion.Mr. McAdam\u2019s vision ought to resonate on Madison Avenue. Advertising executives are nervous about the twin powers of Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which are expected to account for more than half of the American digital advertising revenue this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.They have shown little inclination to send more business to either of Verizon\u2019s dot-com 1.0 duo. Yahoo and AOL\u2019s collective slice of the $69 billion digital-ad market is expected to be 5.2 percent this year, eMarketer forecasts, and is likely to decrease to 4.8 percent in 2017.That has allowed Google and Facebook to gobble up most of the digital-advertising market. It may be that Tim Armstrong, who will run the combined AOL-Yahoo business, has a great plan to turn these two internet also-rans into a formidable force. History suggests otherwise.Jennifer Saba is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.Advertisement"}

We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential.I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not.Notice how today\u2019s tech behemoths \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses.Yahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed.I will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers.Problem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn\u2019t the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully.It\u2019s probably more nuanced than this, but we\u2019re out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog.

{"Headline": "A Mayor Fluent in Twitter Embodies a New Canadian Diversity", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileFor a Muslim man who broke ground when he was elected mayor of a major North American city in 2010, Mr. Nenshi has proved that very few Canadians have a problem with how His Worship actually worships. \u201cNobody cared,\u201d he said, recalling his first win, a success he repeated in 2013, with 74 percent of the vote.The son of ethnic South Asian immigrants from Tanzania and a professed public transit nerd, Mr. Nenshi has thrived in a city and country where personal attacks and cultural issues capture little of the political oxygen that has inflamed voters in the United States and Europe.The city\u2019s demographic shift is a microcosm of Canada\u2019s integration of immigrants, and Mr. Nenshi, who fasts during Ramadan and has led Calgary\u2019s gay pride parade, embodies the country\u2019s increasingly diverse population. Still, Mr. Nenshi is the first nonwhite mayor of Calgary and among the few in a nation that is 80 percent white, according to a 2011 government survey.Then there is Mr. Nenshi\u2019s fixation with purple. The color symbolizes his commitment to inclusive, nonideological government and dominates his professional wardrobe: lavender dress shirts, violet ties, purple shoelaces, loafers the color of grapes. A local rabbi gave him a purple skullcap, shipped from New York, inscribed with his name. In his office hallway, a framed illustration depicts the mayor as a caped superhero in purple spandex.Born in Toronto and raised in a Calgary neighborhood that was already a mix of cultures and languages, Mr. Nenshi grew up keenly aware of the need for civic participation. After obtaining a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Harvard, he worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company before returning to Calgary, where he eventually became a university professor, teaching nonprofit management and marketing.Mr. Nenshi\u2019s journey into government reads like a do-it-yourself guide to disrupting politics as usual. For years, he pursued his wonkish passions strictly from an academic distance, writing reports on how Canadian cities, including Calgary, could become more environmentally sustainable and economically competitive. A failed run for the City Council in 2004 confirmed his role as an outsider.But five years later, with elections for the Council and mayor looming in 2010, he began encouraging corporate chief executives, soccer moms and other Calgary residents to run. \u201cI struck out every time,\u201d he recalled.Then friends challenged him to run for mayor, an idea he initially rejected. \u201cI like research; I do the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the guy kissing the babies.\u201dBut the campaign proved a tempting chance for Mr. Nenshi to turn years of public policy recommendations into action. Along with a group of volunteers that encompassed Calgary\u2019s diverse population, the college professor created a grass-roots strategy aimed at harnessing social media\u2019s potential to engage the city\u2019s traditionally apathetic young and minority residents.More than 33 miles of bicycle paths have been installed across Calgary since 2011. Despite vocal opposition and a close City Council vote, Mr. Nenshi championed a downtown bike network pilot project that was built last year and is now favored by most residents.\u201cNenshi has always been the guy who can help people get motivated to bring about change,\u201d said James Boettcher, a Calgary gelato entrepreneur who pitched the idea of food trucks to the mayor in 2011.The mayor\u2019s popular personal style, which he says is perhaps too unscripted, comes with some risks. \u201cMy mouth still gets me into trouble once in a while,\u201d he said. Much of that public interaction occurs on Twitter, starting when he wakes up in the morning and continuing until lights out.\u201cNobody else has my password,\u201d he said, explaining his more than 47,000 Twitter messages as a vital means of addressing constituents\u2019 needs and improving municipal government. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know the answer sometimes, I Google it for them.\u201dMr. Nenshi is perhaps most famous beyond Calgary for his online \u201csmackdowns.\u201d These range from giving polite advice to a driver who demanded an end to parking tickets (\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe consider not breaking the law\u201d) to challenging personal insults. (\u201cYour casual racism can be fun, but you really need to stop before people actually notice.\u201d)Still, he is happy to inspire his critics to do more than just rant online, even if that means being voted out of office. As he told one Twitter user eager for his electoral defeat: \u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance in 2017! Better start organizing now, though.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pok\u00e9mon Go, With a Corporate Tie-in, Debuts in Japan", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Pikachu, Bulbasaur and other creatures of the Pok\u00e9mon universe returned like conquering heroes to their home country on Friday, and they brought with them a message: Eat at McDonald\u2019s.Pok\u00e9mon Go, the wildly popular mobile game, was released on Friday in Japan, the country that gave rise to the entertainment franchise two decades ago. By evening, more than 10 million people had downloaded the game, its developers said.The game\u2019s highly anticipated introduction here \u2014 several weeks and tens of millions of downloads after it became an unexpected megahit in the United States and other countries \u2014 was treated as a national event, with widespread news coverage and a cautious endorsement from the government.It also offered a test of how Pok\u00e9mon Go and games like it might find new ways to make money. The game\u2019s creators have struck a deal with the Japanese affiliate of McDonald\u2019s to make most of its 2,900 stores in the country available as special game locations.At these in-game \u201cgyms\u201d and \u201cPok\u00e9 spots,\u201d Pok\u00e9mon Go players can pit their monsters against other players\u2019 menageries, or collect items that bolster their creatures\u2019 power. The fast-food company hopes they will buy Big Macs and French fries, too, but does not require it.McDonald\u2019s hopes to draw players like Takahiro Notoya, 33, a web developer who said he had captured five Pok\u00e9mon by midway through his lunch break in the crowded Shibuya neighborhood. As he walked by a McDonald\u2019s outlet with a colleague, the chain\u2019s red-and-gold logo popped up on his smartphone screen.\u201cI played Pok\u00e9mon games and watched the TV show when I was a kid, and it\u2019s amazing to see it take off like this,\u201d he said. Just then, his colleague Naoki Kaneko, 23, announced he had spotted a caterpillarlike Caterpie near the restaurant\u2019s entrance and began flinging virtual balls at the creature on his screen to capture it.Technology companies have increasingly turned to mobile as consumers give up their desktop computers and shift much of their time to smartphones and tablets. But mobile has proved to be a difficult area to make money, in part because smaller screens do not offer as much space for advertising.One widespread strategy has been to give players a chance to spend real-world money to buy items they can use to make their digital alter egos more powerful. But Pok\u00e9mon Go and other so-called augmented-reality games, which fuse digitally created fantasies with physical locations, have additional options, like charging businesses to direct game players to their doorsteps.Like old-time treasure hunts, augmented reality games unfold in real neighborhoods, and for every grumpy resident who wants to keep players off their lawn there is a business that is happy to attract them. Because the game\u2019s creators decide where the treasure is hidden, they can effectively dictate where players go.Pok\u00e9mon Go will have both in-app purchases and sponsored locations, John Hanke, the chief executive of Niantic, said in a recent interview. Niantic, a spinoff of Google, is one of the companies behind Pok\u00e9mon Go, along with Nintendo of Japan.Niantic honed the revenue model for Pok\u00e9mon Go with a previous augmented reality game, a science fiction role-playing game called Ingress that had the Circle K convenience store chain as a location sponsor.For McDonald\u2019s, the association could give a needed push in Japan, a market in which it has stumbled lately. The Japanese affiliate has closed about 200 restaurants in the last two years, and it lost 34.9 billion yen, or about $329 million, last year, as it has struggled to adapt to changing consumer preferences and regain trust after several food-contamination scandals.Shares in McDonald\u2019s Japan jumped to a 15-year high after news of the sponsorship leaked this week, while Nintendo\u2019s market value has swelled by billions of dollars since Pok\u00e9mon Go made its debut in the United States.Niantic and Nintendo did not explain why the game was released late in Japan, although securing enough server capacity has been an issue in other markets. Many players said they had grown frustrated with the wait.\u201cI\u2019ve been studying up on all the tricks to catch Pikachu,\u201d the game\u2019s signature yellow monster, said Tomoki Tanaka, a 15-year-old-high school student who was hunting for Pok\u00e9mon with a classmate, Ryuta Mizusawa. They had not been born when Nintendo introduced Pok\u00e9mon as a game for its classic Game Boy hand-held console in the mid-1990s, but they grew up with subsequent iterations of the franchise.Yoshihide Suga, the government\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, said he was \u201cvery happy that content from our country is so popular around the world.\u201d But echoing authorities in other counties wary of potential nuisance and accidents by distracted players, he encouraged fans to \u201cuse their smartphones safely.\u201dAlex Williams and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

What were your early years like?I remember hating going to Brownies, and I always felt slightly out of sorts there, so I quit. But then I locked myself in the bathroom at home and cried. And my mom asked, \u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d It was from feeling guilty that I quit. Ultimately I went back and finished Brownies and did a year of Girl Guides, and then I quit.Why did you go back if you didn\u2019t like it?It was conscientiousness and guilt from not having followed through on something. It was feeling that if I\u2019m going to quit, I can\u2019t quit this way. I still think of myself as a conscientious person.Tell me about your parents.They\u2019re both doctors, and my father loved running his medical practice as a business.Early on, he taught us all how to do his ledgers and his income taxes. I was doing his income taxes when I was about 10 or 11, and then as a teenager I built a system to do his ledgers on the computer.He always would say to me when I was young, \u201cYou should work for yourself.\u201d By the time I was about 25, I wanted to start a business.It seems you were driven from an early age.I\u2019m just wired that way. If anything, I wish there were days I could dial down my intensity. I\u2019ve always wanted to do more.And my parents were always highly conscientious. Their work ethic was incredible. They immigrated to Canada when they were older and had to restart their medical careers.What were your college years like?Interestingly, college was my revolt period after growing up in a highly conservative household. So when I went away to college, I was going to have a good time. My grades were good, but I was mostly enjoying the freedom to make my own choices.Your first job was on Wall Street. Was your compass always pointed there?My compass was not pointed anywhere. Interestingly, for somebody who was so intense, I actually didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I went through a recruiting cycle after graduating but didn\u2019t get a job. So I went from feeling great about myself as a high school student to wondering what\u2019s wrong with me. I felt pretty demoralized. It really made me question myself. Then I interviewed at Merrill Lynch, and the hiring process went really fast.So now I tell college grads, you\u2019re going to end up where you\u2019re supposed to be. In hindsight, why did Merrill work? In some ways, it\u2019s very clear. I\u2019m aggressive; Merrill is aggressive. I\u2019m intense; Merrill is intense. I don\u2019t come wrapped up in this nice neat bow, and so why was I surprised that the more conservative places didn\u2019t hire me?You have worked at a lot of companies, including Google, Amazon, BSkyB. It seems you like new challenges.I\u2019ve learned that my risk tolerance is high. Partly it comes from having had to figure out that time after college when I was having trouble getting hired. And then it finally worked.I always say to people, once you realize you\u2019re employable, everything else is O.K. I\u2019m always willing to let go of something before the next thing shows up because I have the sense that I could put food on the table.The other part of it is that I\u2019m very impatient. Whenever I think I\u2019m stagnating and not going to get where I\u2019m meant to go, I have this anxiety. So the anxiety of not getting there overwhelms the fear of uncertainty. So I guess I just trade one fear for another. People see that as risk tolerance, but it\u2019s more this sense that I\u2019m supposed to contribute something more or learn something more.Early leadership lessons?I\u2019ve learned to have a little bit of distance from the people I manage, and I don\u2019t feel the need that they all need to be at my house for dinner every weekend. On the other hand, I feel they\u2019re pretty sure that I am emotionally committed to them and emotionally invested in making them successful. When people feel you\u2019re all in on the company and on them, they will forgive a lot of imperfections and errors. It\u2019s really about authenticity.I also have this philosophy now, which I tell my team all the time, of, \u201cEither you manage me or I manage you. Which would you prefer?\u201dI like to give people a lot of rope. I like to see what they can do, but I also have an amazing capacity for detail. I know what they said they were going to do, and if they\u2019re not doing it, what\u2019s happening? Then I\u2019m starting to pull the rope back.And if I\u2019m starting to manage your time, you\u2019re not at your best, and I\u2019m not at my best. Because when I\u2019m managing your time with the opinions I have, I\u2019m going to start telling you what to do, right? I\u2019d rather bring my vision collaboratively with somebody else\u2019s vision. But if you show up with no vision, you\u2019re going to walk out with my vision, which I don\u2019t think is a very empowering place to be.How do you hire?I love really smart people, but I love really smart people who are focused on the good of the company before themselves. That gets my respect like nothing else. It\u2019s a unique combination to find somebody who is so capable and smart, but has some level of humility about their place in the entire ecosystem. I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of people who are really smart, but it\u2019s all about them. And that\u2019s a very frustrating place for me.I also always ask people what drains their energy, and what gives them energy. That tells me a lot about what people like to do and what they\u2019re good at.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climbing Down the Corporate Ladder Without Alarming Your Boss", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byThe WorkologistBut it is possible that any given boss may take a more traditional view and interpret any attempt by you to \u201cdownsize\u201d your responsibilities as an announcement that you\u2019re ready to start coasting toward retirement. So it\u2019s important to frame this carefully.Start by seeking out others in your company (and in your field) who have made a similar transition, Ms. Blake suggests, and find out how they managed it. And think of this move in positive terms \u2014 \u201cgoing from a more senior position into a more specialized one,\u201d as she put it. \u201cAnd really examine what individual contributor role you\u2019d find most exciting.\u201d Take this seriously: You want to think about an outcome that you would genuinely feel good about.Then, when you actually go to management, don\u2019t be apologetic. \u201cFrame it as: \u2018I\u2019ve given this some reflection, and the things that I am truly best at, and where I\u2019ve really had the most impact, are X, Y and Z,\u201d Ms. Blake said. Give specific examples \u2014 the \u201ccategories of impact, and the results in those areas,\u201d she said. The bottom line is sending the message that this isn\u2019t about kicking back; it\u2019s about doing what most excites you, and thus what should excite your employer, in this new, more focused role.It may also be worth using essentially the same process to explore opportunities elsewhere. (The Workologist is, in general, always a fan of remaining open to opportunities elsewhere.) But you may discover that your current employer is your best bet. Sometimes, Ms. Blake said, it\u2019s actually a relief to management that not everyone is angling for the same outcome; it can be extremely valuable when a skilled employee \u201cmoves to a different track\u201d that can help the company in new ways.I\u2019m happy to receive this comment (and a few others from readers who made related points), because it gives me a reason to expand on something I only had room to hint at in that column. All the experts I talked to cautioned against going overboard with online application processes: While applying for a zillion jobs feels productive, it\u2019s often more effective to take more care in pursuing a smaller number of more thoughtfully targeted positions.In other words: Network, person-to-person. This is exactly why the Workologist believes the job search should be a permanent activity, at least on some low-key level. Today\u2019s casual acquaintance could be tomorrow\u2019s crucial link to a new and better gig.So, yes, your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should be \u201coptimized\u201d for applicant-tracking systems. But don\u2019t spend all your energy on that. Taking time to arrange one informational interview that really cements a productive contact who will remember you and your skills, Ms. Horowitz suggested, might well prove to be more supportive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yahoo Is a Case Study in Poor Timing", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsYahoo has fittingly closed a portal on tech mergers and acquisitions.The company\u2019s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon caps two decades of deals and non-deals that shaped internet history. Yahoo got lucky with Alibaba, but failed to capitalize on its dominance by not acquiring companies like Google, Facebook and eBay. Spurning Microsoft also was a mistake. It is a one-company textbook on timing.Yahoo, the web creation of Jerry Yang and David Filo, captured the popular embrace of the internet back in 1994, and a large chunk of the internet\u2019s value along with it. Its market capitalization once exceeded $140 billion, and it even occupied the exclusive Boardwalk spot in a dot-com edition of the Monopoly board game. It failed, however, to anticipate how technology would supplant human curation of the web.Its overpriced stock was successfully deployed during the heady days of tech mayhem in the 1990s, but put to poor use. It spent $3.6 billion on the web-hosting service GeoCities and another $5.7 billion on the early internet-radio service Broadcast.com. Both services eventually faded away. Yahoo first ignored Google and then quibbled over a price tag that was lower than Broadcast\u2019s. Mark Zuckerberg likewise rejected a $1 billion offer for his fledgling Facebook.Yahoo kept showcasing its inverse Midas touch. The internet-ad auction firm Overture, the photo-sharing service Flickr and other promising start-ups simply were clouded by Yahoo\u2019s miasma.It is exceptionally tough to arrest a tech business in decline. The Alibaba deal, however, gave Yahoo the financial firepower to subsist for longer than it otherwise might have. In 2005, it contributed its own Chinese business and $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba, an investment now worth some $30 billion. The lack of self-awareness by the founders about Yahoo\u2019s faltering health, however, was its downfall. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo torpedoed the generous $45 billion takeover offer in 2008 from a then-panicky Microsoft.In the end, Yahoo may have managed to gin up a frothier auction than it deserved and thus fetched an outsize price from Verizon. It will be little consolation given what might have been. At least Yahoo has left behind a case study in M.&A. that should be of significant value.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley-Driven Hype for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionHere\u2019s another view: Mr. Brown may be the first casualty of the widespread and potentially dangerous belief that autonomous cars are much closer to being road-ready than they actually are.Mr. Brown, who died in Florida on May 7, does not appear to have been heeding an important rule in the official instruction manual for the Tesla Autopilot feature he was using: Drivers should keep their hands on the wheel and be ready to resume control of the vehicle at any time.Instead, he seems to have been answering to a higher authority: Elon Musk, a founder and the chief executive of Tesla Motors.It wouldn\u2019t be fair to tar all of the growing self-driving industry with Mr. Musk\u2019s braggadocio. Nonetheless, his technological over-promising fits into a common narrative in Silicon Valley: The major engineering problems with self-driving cars have essentially been solved, and their widespread adoption is inevitable. Ask \u201cwhen?\u201d and you\u2019ll usually be told, \u201cMuch sooner than you think.\u201dAware of the conventional wisdom that robotic cars are about to cause an epochal \u201cdisruption,\u201d automakers are eager to demonstrate that they are fully engaged. A result has been a drumbeat of announcements auguring the imminent arrival of robotic cars, almost as though they were the next generation of iPhones. The breathless statements are especially beguiling for members of the public without the engineering background required to understand the challenges that remain. In other words, most people.Volvo, for example, recently announced a program called \u201cDrive Me London,\u201d which in two years will put 100 self-driving cars on the road in what it says will be the \u201cU.K.\u2019s most ambitious autonomous driving trial.\u201d Envisioning myself being driven around Trafalgar Square by a robot, I called up the company for more information. It turns out the news release didn\u2019t quite tell the whole story. I was told that all the autonomous driving will initially be limited to England\u2019s major motorways; everywhere else, the steering must still be done manually, including within London proper.Motorways and freeways are the low-hanging fruit of autonomous driving; everyone is moving in one direction at the same relative speed, and there are no pesky pedestrians to get in the way. Much of what is passed off today as \u201cautonomous driving\u201d is some variation of this sort of advanced cruise control.But there is an elephant in the cab with even this rudimentary form of autonomy. Many companies are planning cars that, in the event of an emergency, hand back control to the human driver. (Google, a notable exception, plans a car with no steering wheel or brake pedal.) The potentially fatal weakness of this strategy is that it assumes \u201cdrivers\u201d will be paying attention at the split second they are most needed, instead of being busy, say, taking a nap.The much harder, and still mainly unsolved, autonomous driving problem involves not highways but cities, with all their chaos and complexity. Self-driving cars still struggle with simple potholes; no one has come even close to demonstrating a completely driverless car that could do the work of a Manhattan taxi driver on a rainy day.The sad reality of autonomous car technology is that the easy parts of have yet to be proven safe, and the hard parts have yet to be proven possible. We\u2019re nowhere close to Silicon Valley\u2019s automotive \u201cTomorrowland.\u201dThe most realistic industry projection about the arrival of autonomous driving comes from the company that\u2019s done the most to make it possible. Google, while never explicitly saying so, has long intimated that self-driving cars would be available by the end of the decade.Historians of technology know that \u201cin 30 years\u201d often ends up being \u201cnever.\u201d Even if that\u2019s not the case here, if you\u2019re expecting a self-driving car, you should also expect a wait. And so you might want to do something to pass the time. Maybe go for a nice drive?Lee Gomes is a former technology reporter for The Wall Street Journal.Advertisement"}

For a start, none of the usual suspects in Los Angeles knew this supposed mover and shaker. I called party promoters, paparazzi, neighbors (Daren Metropoulos has lived next door to the Playboy Mansion in Holmby Hills since 2009) and Hollywood agents who make it their business to know everyone in town with money to burn. Their repeated response: \u201cDaren who?\u201d\u201cThe offer then was for about $75 million,\u201d Mr. Hyland said.Bill Toler, the chief executive of Hostess, told me that Mr. Metropoulos had worked in the family food businesses since he was a teenager. \u201cI was always impressed by the way Daren wanted to learn how to do things the right way,\u201d Mr. Toler said. \u201cHe would go spend a day working at retail. He would delve into marketing and then go learn how the sales department operated.\u201dMr. Toler added: \u201cI assure you, his interest in the Playboy Mansion is very pure. He\u2019s not the new Hugh Hefner. That\u2019s just silly.\u201dBut I still had unanswered questions. What are his interests? Sports? Art? Travel? Nobody seemed to know. A spokeswoman for the Metropoulos family did confirm that Mr. Metropoulos, who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., did not graduate from college, having dropped out after his sophomore year to work for his father. He had been studying business at the University of Connecticut.If Mr. Metropoulos, who has never married and has no children, is as ordinary as family friends insist, preferring a night at home to hanging at Chateau Marmont \u2014 and yet still has an unruly public image \u2014 he may be the perfect fit for the Playboy Mansion. Purchased by Mr. Hefner in 1971 for about $1 million, the 29-room, five-acre estate (replete with a zoo license and year-round fireworks permit) now bears little resemblance in reality to its mythic reputation.\u201cThe heritage of this property transcends its celebrity, and to have the opportunity to serve as its steward would be a true privilege,\u201d Mr. Metropoulos said in a statement last month. (The deal had not closed escrow as of Friday.)But living quietly on Charing Cross Road may not be the intention. \u201cIf there is anybody who can make Playboy more interesting, more relevant, it\u2019s Daren,\u201d Mr. van der Vord said. \u201cIt will be fascinating to watch what he does with that brand.\u201dWait a minute.When the family owned Chef Boyardee, Mr. Metropoulos contributed to a successful ad campaign featuring pro wrestlers. At Pabst, he promoted the company\u2019s lesser-known brews with celebrity endorsements. (Hence the Snoop Dogg party.)One reason for the trepidation: Mr. Metropoulos has been a hotelier before.When he found out that Mr. Metropoulos was buying the Playboy Mansion, Mr. Baeriswil said he reached out to his former boss.\u201cI told him: \u2018Wow! What a purchase! With all of those rooms, you\u2019re going to need an innkeeper,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baeriswil recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018Sounds like a great idea. Let\u2019s put a plan together.\u2019\u201dThe Scene Stealers column on July 31 about J. Daren Metropoulos, the new owner of the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, misstated the outcome of a 2009 lawsuit against Mr. Metropoulos. It was dismissed, not settled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Character, Fate and Yahoo", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byBitsYahoo, we hardly knew ye.But then again, ye hardly knew yourself.It is hardly a surprising turn. Yahoo is 21 years old, and for more than half its life people have wondered if the company could get the magic back. More than anything, that is a mark of the good will Silicon Valley long held for the company, and its seemingly boyish founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo.For many, not least shareholders, Yahoo would have been better off taking Microsoft\u2019s $44.6 billion bid in 2008, which is almost $50 billion in today\u2019s money. The company is now valued at $35 billion, and the figure is that high only because in February Yahoo decided to sell its core assets (around the same time it announced a big layoff).When so much has gone wrong to something once so seemingly wonderful, one ascribes bad luck, and bad management. When it happens over so many years, under so many different leaders, however, it\u2019s also worth asking whether there wasn\u2019t also some flaw of character, or what in corporate terms is called culture.The Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs reportedly told Yahoo early in the millennium that it had to decide whether it was a tech company or a content company. This was a sensible and profound point, and something Yahoo never accomplished.That may be because content and tech were always contending at Yahoo. Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo, two engineers, started out by pointing out cool sites on the young World Wide Web. Human taste, meet high tech.Tim Koogle, the company\u2019s first chief executive, was a mechanical engineer, and was succeeded by Terry Semel, a Hollywood guy who bragged that he didn\u2019t use email. Thereafter, \u201cWhat are we?\u201d was a question Yahoo\u2019s leaders seemed to be perpetually addressing.Human curators at Yahoo, eventually an entire building full of them, tried to apply taste and by-hand content organization of the web even as the web exploded. The two companies Yahoo most famously missed buying \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 were far more successful bypassing human organization, and finding algorithms that worked on things like page links and social posts.If you had to choose between tech and content, clearly tech was the superior way to go (if for no other reason than there was no great content company in Silicon Valley). But that implies that Yahoo could have chosen.Maybe Mr. Jobs was wrong, inasmuch as Yahoo couldn\u2019t actually make the kind of choice he demanded of it. It was always a bit of both things, and seems to have collapsed under this, and many other contradictions.Advertisement"}

And it does not have a \u201cLike\u201d button.The shift was evident in a Lowe\u2019s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries.The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.Silicon Valley\u2019s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing self-driving cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a half-dozen types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized.\u201cWe saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom \u2014 there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,\u201d said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco.Funding in A.I. start-ups has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1.2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year.\u201cWhenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,\u201d said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. \u201cBut you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don\u2019t happen every day.\u201dSilicon Valley\u2019s new A.I. era underscores the region\u2019s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend.\u201cThis is at the heart of the region\u2019s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. \u201cThe valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning.\u201dThe change spurred a rush for talent in A.I. that has become intense.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. \u201cThe number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy.\u201dThe valley\u2019s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region\u2019s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a consumer-electronics manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the mid-1970s. A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet.A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would \u2014 for at least another generation \u2014 remain the world\u2019s innovation center.How far the A.I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today\u2019s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have human-level intelligence.Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A.I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of start-ups. Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the \u201cA.I. Winter.\u201dThe current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong.\u201cThere is no chance of a new winter,\u201d said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence start-ups.John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A.I. companies. \u201cYou get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,\u201d he said.For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A.I. companies in the 1980s \u2014 Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down \u2014 the Valley\u2019s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered.\u201cSometimes when I hang around with A.I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But the insurance claims process for cars using the systems generally works the same way as for cars without them, said Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group.That is, when an investigation of the accident is completed, the insurer of the driver at fault pays for injuries and damage to the others, up to the limits of the policy. (Mr. Hartwig said he was speaking generally, and was not privy to the details of any applicable insurance in the Tesla accident.)While there is a potential question about whether the driver or the software was at fault, he said, in practice the insurer would typically pay the claim and then have the right to \u201csubrogate,\u201d or file a claim against someone else, like the manufacturer or another insurer, to recoup its payment. (There is no exclusion in auto policies for software defects, he said.)Khobi Brooklyn, a Tesla spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement that the company\u2019s Autopilot system \u201cdoes not turn a Tesla into an autonomous vehicle and does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility.\u201dTesla markets its cars to the public, and drivers generally must carry state-mandated minimum liability insurance, which pays for damage to other people, cars and property. (New Hampshire is the sole state that doesn\u2019t require liability coverage.)However, Mr. Hartwig said, insurers may not know they are providing coverage for a potentially self-driving car. Generally, the owner of a new car contacts the insurer to request a quote for coverage. The owner typically provides the vehicle identification number, which identifies the specific make and model of the car \u2014 in this case, a Tesla Model S. But the identification number would not necessarily inform the insurer of the various options chosen on the car, Mr. Hartwig said, or whether the owner had activated the Autopilot software.Insurers are likely to begin inquiring about those details more often, he said.Paul Grieco, a lawyer representing the family of the deceased Tesla driver, Joshua Brown, said on Sunday that Mr. Brown had a \u201cstandard\u201d auto insurance policy covering the Tesla, but he declined to identify the carrier.Mr. Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed on May 7 when the Tesla he was operating collided with a tractor-trailer in Williston, Fla. Tesla has confirmed that the Autopilot feature, which the company described as being in a \u201cpublic beta\u201d test, was activated before the crash.Florida authorities and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are investigating.Many truly self-driving cars are part of fleets being tested by auto manufacturers or companies like Google, rather than cars sold to private buyers. Such companies typically self-insure or carry special fleet insurance that applies if the cars are involved in an accident, said Hilary Rowen, a lawyer with Sedgwick in San Francisco who represents insurers.Features like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, Ms. Rowen said, should really be considered driver-assisted systems, rather than true self-driving technology, which allows the driver to be a mere passenger. Tesla\u2019s system is a sophisticated combination of various driver-assist features, she said, but Tesla warns drivers to \u201ckeep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\u201dMr. Hartwig said it was too soon to say how self-driving systems would affect insurance rates. \u201cThe technology is so new that there\u2019s not a lot of actuarial data\u201d to determine whether it significantly affects the frequency or severity of accidents, he said. Insurers, as they have done with other advances, from seatbelts to newer features like airbags and rollover prevention systems, gather information over time and adjust rates to reflect the impact of the changes, if warranted, he said.But the very nature of self-driving technology may make it challenging to apply data from the cars to insurance premiums, Ms. Rowen said. \u201cThis is going to be a disruptive technology for the insurance industry,\u201d she said. That is because computer software running the systems is continuously updated. So while insurers generally track trends with a certain make and model of car, the safety performance of an individual self-driving car may actually change over time, as software updates correct problems.These issues will probably take as much as a decade to sort out, she said. In the future, during the claims process insurers may seek data from more sophisticated versions of black-box recorders to shed light on the cause of an accident. \u201cIs it a driver problem?\u201d she asked. \u201cA software problem? Or some sort of muddle of the two?\u201dA picture with an article on Monday about the challenge of self-driving vehicles to the automobile insurance industry was published in error. The self-driving system shown was in a Continental test vehicle, not a Tesla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Hunt, \u2018Where Warm Waters Halt,\u2019 for a $2 Million Treasure", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byCUNDIYO, N.M. \u2014 Cynthia Meachum began her search for the hidden treasure at the confluence of two shallow streams in this tiny village north of Santa Fe, the spot \u201cwhere warm waters halt,\u201d or at least that\u2019s where she thinks they do.The poem has 24 verses. There are nine clues. Or so he says.Ms. Meachum, 62, thinks she has deciphered eight of them \u2014 \u201cor maybe not,\u201d she conceded. She has been second-guessing herself since she started looking for the treasure three years ago.Mr. Fenn, 85, a successful art dealer in Santa Fe, had no better explanation for hiding a treasure \u2014 he calculates it could be worth $2 million \u2014 than to say he wanted to give families a reason to \u201cget off their couches.\u201dHe estimates that 65,000 people have joined the search for riches that are described as \u201c265 gold coins, hundreds of gold nuggets, hundreds of rubies, eight emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires, many diamonds, two ancient Chinese jade carvings, pre-Columbian gold bracelets and fetishes, and more.\u201dHe has only his word to show that the treasure is real.Embarking on the search is as easy as buying a state map at a gas station off scenic Route 285, unfolding it on the hood of a rental car and looking for the place \u201cwhere warm waters halt,\u201d as his poem said. But actually finding treasure is not as simple.Asking Mr. Fenn does not necessarily speed up the process either. Send him a question like, \u201cIs this hidden spot near your home?\u201d and the reply will be maddeningly mysterious.\u201cI don\u2019t know how close near is,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo an ant, a mud puddle can be an ocean.\u201dA typical question: \u201cMay I ask what type of car you used to go into the mountains to hide the treasure chest?\u201dA typical answer: \u201cA sedan.\u201dMr. Fenn has offered this much: The treasure is at least 8.25 miles north of Santa Fe, somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and \u201chigher than 5,000 feet above sea level.\u201d He drove, parked and carried the treasure to its hiding spot in two trips. First, he took the cast bronze chest. Then he took the valuables in a backpack.Searchers have scoured public and private lands in four states, scouting out possible locations on paper maps, on Google Earth and on foot, using the poem as their guide.But other searchers continued looking for a more material reward.Some people do not believe Mr. Fenn. They assert that he has made up the treasure story to sell more copies of his memoir, whose printing and binding are done according to his precise specifications by Collected Works, a bookstore and coffeehouse in Santa Fe that donates part of the proceeds to charity and keeps the rest.\u201cHe has never taken a dime from the sales,\u201d said one of the bookstore\u2019s owners, Mary Wolf.Mr. Fenn\u2019s wealth appears sizable. A small fortune is on display on the floor and walls of his compound \u2014 Persian rugs, Blackfeet Indian daggers and an assortment of rare books, including the proof sheets for Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court,\u201d with 26 of the author\u2019s markings.Ms. Meachum, who has been looking for the treasure full time since she lost her job last year repairing lithography machines for a subsidiary of Nikon, once snowshoed 9,000 feet uphill to comb through a search area. She has canvassed 20 locations, and has taken notes and photographs documenting every reasoning of hers and every turn on a road, trail or canyon.She is a student of Mr. Fenn\u2019s. Her exploits are neatly cataloged in three binders, his writings are arranged in a neat pile by her desktop, and his quotations are carefully handwritten on the pages of a notebook.\u201cTo find this treasure,\u201d she said, \u201cI have to get inside his head.\u201dShe scrutinized a trout fishing book, she said, following two streams, Rio Medio and Rio Frijoles, to their meeting spot on lower ground, under a bridge in Cundiyo, their waters warmed by the sun.She drove me there last month, to a spot where the rivers\u2019 warm waters halted, and used lines in the poem to explain each of her moves.Sometimes, she made sense.She climbed rough steps wedged on the face of a mountain, toward a narrow trail above. \u201cAnd take it in the canyon down,\u201d the next line in the poem says. To Ms. Meachum, that\u2019s the second clue \u2014 and we were on it.She followed the winding, narrow trail down into a canyon. There were rocks on one side. The river rushed down below, sheltered by groves of cottonwood trees. She recommended keeping an eye on the mountains and \u201clook for something unusual.\u201d Keeping an eye on the steep embankment is probably not a bad idea either.Clues three, four, five, six, seven and eight revealed themselves one after the other in the verses \u2014 or was it Ms. Meachum twisting the words to make them fit?\u201cThere\u2019ll be no paddle up your creek,\u201d read the poem, \u201cjust heavy loads and water high.\u201dOn the edge of a cliff, she closed her eyes and took long deep breaths. Clue nine confronted her: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been wise and found the blaze,\u201d it says, \u201cLook quickly down, your quest to cease.\u201d\u201cDo you see anything that looks like the blaze?\u201d she asked me.I pointed to a rock that seemed more red than the ones around it.\u201cNah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a rock.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Technology Is Monitoring the Urban Landscape", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Big City is watching you.It will do it with camera-equipped drones that inspect municipal power lines and robotic cars that know where people go. Sensor-laden streetlights will change brightness based on danger levels. Technologists and urban planners are working on a major transformation of urban landscapes over the next few decades.Much of it involves the close monitoring of things and people, thanks to digital technology. To the extent that this makes people\u2019s lives easier, the planners say, they will probably like it. But troubling and knotty questions of privacy and control remain.Much of the change will also come from the private sector, which is moving faster to reach city dwellers, and is more skilled in collecting and responding to data. That is leading cities everywhere to work more closely than ever with private companies, which may have different priorities than the government.One of the biggest changes that will hit a digitally aware city, it is widely agreed, is the seemingly prosaic issue of parking. Space given to parking is expected to shrink by half or more, as self-driving cars and drone deliveries lead an overall shift in connected urban transport. That will change or eliminate acres of urban space occupied by raised and underground parking structures.Shared vehicles are not parked as much, and with more automation, they will know where parking spaces are available, eliminating the need to drive in search of a space.\u201cOffice complexes won\u2019t need parking lots with twice the footprint of their buildings,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, who led Google\u2019s self-driving car project in its early days and now runs Udacity, an online learning company. \u201cWhen we started on self-driving cars, we talked all the time about cutting the number of cars in a city by a factor of three,\u201d or a two-thirds reduction.In addition, police, fire, and even library services will seek greater responsiveness by tracking their own assets, and partly by looking at things like social media. Later, technologies like three-dimensional printing, new materials and robotic construction and demolition will be able to reshape skylines in a matter of weeks.At least that is the plan. So much change afoot creates confusion.\u201cWe know for sure that there will be a lot of physical changes to our cities,\u201d said Timothy Papandreou, the chief innovation officer for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. \u201cStreets will be redesigned. There will be lots more real-time data. Automation will be everywhere. But it\u2019s also crazy: Things are changing so quickly that we can\u2019t pretend to have all the answers.\u201dOne reason for confidence in a radically changed future is that much of it is already here. The city\u2019s Uber and Lyft, the Boston-based auto-sharing company Zipcar and things like corporate shuttle buses have shown new ways for urban dwellers to use vehicles. Skylines in cities like London and Shanghai are full of unusually shaped buildings, thanks in part to computer-assisted design.Rare robots can build with bricks, or monitor and rebuild the underground water, sewage and electrical pipes that make a city functional. It is hard to find a new municipal vehicle that does not come with a tracking system.To the planners, innovations like automatic cars that learn people\u2019s habits are simply an extension of trends. Mr. Papandreou said 13 companies are testing automated vehicles in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re inviting start-ups to come in and work on the problems we have,\u201d he said.The city is developing a policy for drone-based deliveries. Emergency medical goods, transported from an airport to a hospital, are likely to be first, he said. But consumer goods may eventually be delivered by air.Besides drones, the abundance of vehicles now on urban sidewalks, including motorized wheelchairs, scooters and hoverboards, is another intimation of the variety of ways people and things are expected to move, as digital technologies make these modes of transportation cheaper. Likewise, temporary offices and pop-up stores may foreshadow an urban landscape that changes faster than ever.One danger of the new city may be the age-old faith that technology makes things better, and more tech is best.\u201cThe danger of big dramatic projects is that they become the equivalent of urban renewal or the kind of sweeping things Robert Moses did for cars in New York that created dysfunction,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a technology forecaster. \u201cThe best thing tech could do now is rescue us from the car-centric cities we built after 1930.\u201dThe new techno-optimism is focused on big data and artificial intelligence. \u201cFuturists used to think everyone would have their own plane,\u201d said Erick Guerra, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe never have a good understanding of how things will actually turn out.\u201dHe recently surveyed the 25 largest metropolitan planning organizations in the country and found that almost none have solid plans for modernizing their infrastructure. That may be the right way to approach the challenges of cities full of robots, but so far most clues are coming from companies that also sell the technology.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty, and a competition to show they\u2019re low on regulation,\u201d Mr. Guerra said. \u201cThere is too much potential money for new technology to be regulated out.\u201dThe big tech companies say they are not interested in imposing the sweeping \u201csmart city\u201d projects they used to push, in part because things are changing too quickly. But they still want to build big, and they view digital surveillance as an essential component.\u201cDigital infrastructure is like plumbing or electricity. You can\u2019t just have point-by-point solutions,\u201d said Rick Huijbregts, managing director of the Americas division of the computer networking company Cisco Systems. \u201cCars have to talk to other transit, to traffic lights, to law enforcement.\u201dIs that creepy? \u201cOur next generation, born after 1995, doesn\u2019t know a life without computers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know a way of living without this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Yahoo Ruled the Valley: Stories of the Original \u2018Surfers\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Back in the mid-1990s, before Google even existed, the world\u2019s best guides to the internet sat in Silicon Valley cubicles, visiting websites and carefully categorizing them by hand.They were called surfers, and they were a collection of mostly 20-somethings \u2014 including a yoga lover, an ex-banker, a divinity student, a recent college grad from Ohio hungry for adventure \u2014 all hired by a start-up called Yahoo to build a directory of the world\u2019s most interesting websites.Today, with more than one billion websites across the globe, the very notion seems mad. Even then, there was a hint of insanity about the enterprise.Two decades after Yahoo\u2019s founding \u2014 the equivalent of several lifetimes in Silicon Valley \u2014 Elvis still serenades the surfers at the headquarters here in Sunnyvale, and Yahoo is at a crossroads. The company, long since eclipsed by Google and Facebook, now commands just a tiny fraction of people\u2019s attention and advertisers\u2019 dollars.Yahoo is auctioning itself off. Bids are due on Monday, the same day the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is expected to report yet another quarter of dismal financial results.Most, but not all, of the surfers have scattered across Silicon Valley and the world. The careers of some followed the arc of the tech world\u2019s obsessions and idiosyncrasies over the last 20 years. Others took their stock windfalls and dropped out to pursue other passions. Taken together, the surfers, about 10 of whom are still in the building, embody the technological and cultural changes that transformed the valley and the world \u2014 and left Yahoo in the dust.Back in 1994, when the directory was born, search engines were rudimentary and ineffectual. Newbies were just learning how to navigate the World Wide Web. The very idea of a website was novel.Two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, saw opportunity. Working from a trailer on campus, they began compiling websites into a list, organized by topic. They eventually named it Yahoo, an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.It quickly became one of the most important gateways to the web. The value proposition was simple, said one longtime surfer, Dave Sikula: \u201cWe\u2019ve done the work for you \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through the web and these are the best sites.\u201dThat required an army of people, said Srinija Srinivasan, employee No. 5 at Yahoo, who was hired to build the original surfer team.It was serious work, deciding how to label things and where to put them. What do you call a category that includes skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan? What kind of pornography should be considered for inclusion, given that \u201csex\u201d was the most popular search term from the start?Much was left to individual judgment. Matthew Mustapick, who quit a job at Wells Fargo to become a surfer in 1995, recalled creating the \u201ccannibalism\u201d category. He found sites explaining how to butcher a human body but decided they were too distasteful to include.Amey Mathews, who worked as a Yahoo surfer from 1998 to 2002 (and is now married to Mr. Mustapick), discovered in the course of her work that the Irish originally carved their jack-o\u2019-lanterns from turnips, not pumpkins. After that, the surfers held a turnip-carving contest every Halloween.The directory survived until 2014. But by then, most of the surfers\u2019 time already went to other projects. Many of them worked to improve Yahoo\u2019s search engine as it battled with Alphabet\u2019s Google subsidiary. Still, Yahoo\u2019s star continued to fade, particularly with the rise of smartphones and social applications like Facebook and Twitter.Today, some former surfers ponder the company\u2019s fate with sadness and a hint of regret at opportunities missed. \u201cYahoo Mail is still my primary email. My home page is still My Yahoo. I still look at the sports page,\u201d said Mr. Sikula, who is a stage director and freelance editor after being laid off in 2010 as part of a big surfer cutback.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know why the company exists. And I think that\u2019s what they are trying to figure out, too.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t chosen to study Japanese at Stanford, Srinija Srinivasan would never have found herself in charge of building Yahoo\u2019s directory into a guide to the internet for a curious world.Ms. Srinivasan, who grew up in Kansas, was an undergraduate attending a tech-focused Stanford program in Kyoto, Japan, when she got to know two fellow students over shared meals \u2014 Jerry Yang and David Filo. After graduation, she was working on the Cyc Project, an early effort to create artificial intelligence, when the pair asked her to help them turn their directory into a real company.\u201cJerry and David knew that I alphabetized my CDs,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan, 44, said in an interview in her Palo Alto, Calif., home. \u201cMy sock drawer is quite beautiful.\u201dWhen she joined, her business card read Ontological Yahoo, a term reflecting her philosophical approach to the job. \u201cThis is not a perfunctory file-keeping exercise. This is defining the nature of being,\u201d she said. \u201cCategories and classifications are the basis for each of our worldviews. \u201dFaced with the vastness of the web, Yahoo surfers hoped to identify the most complete, relevant or interesting sites on a given subject. To choose which topics to focus on, the surfers relied in part on a daily log of visitors\u2019 top queries.Once in a while, surfers made mistakes. For instance, they initially categorized Messianic Judaism as a Jewish sect, failing to notice that its adherents, who follow many Jewish traditions, believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, a defining trait of Christians. \u201cWe had faxes coming in nonstop from rabbis,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said.Yahoo also offered automated search tools by teaming up with various companies, including AltaVista and Google. Eventually, though, Yahoo realized that it had to develop its own version of the technology.Human judgment \u2014 what Mr. Yang referred to as \u201cthe voice of Yahoo\u201d \u2014 remained a core value of the company. When the Grateful Dead musician Jerry Garcia died in August 1995, Yahoo searches on him spiked immediately. The surfers put a Garcia link on the home page. \u201cThat was the birth of Yahoo News,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said. Today, it remains one of the most popular online news portals.The surfers\u2019 role as corporate conscience expanded with the company. They worked on a child-safe version of Yahoo, called Yahooligans. They selected the news headlines worthy of home-page display. Over time, Ms. Srinivasan and her team even fielded questions like how much cleavage to allow on home-page ads.Despite its efforts, Yahoo kept losing ground to Google in search. Microsoft made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy the weakened company in 2008. Ms. Srinivasan left two years later, soon after Mr. Yang stepped down as chief executive. \u201cIn Japan, they have a saying: Leave when the cherry blossoms are full,\u201d she said.She also sits on the board of trustees of her alma mater, Stanford, a school that has churned out several generations of Silicon Valley moguls. But unlike many former technology executives, Ms. Srinivasan focuses her attention there on the arts and humanities.\u201cTech is sexy. It\u2019s employable. Parents love it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that isn\u2019t worth a hill of beans unless we know why, to what end. We call it the humanities for a reason.\u201dYahoo, like the early web itself, was largely focused on American content. But it had global ambitions. Seana Meek, an Alberta native and a single mother, was working for Futurekids, which taught children computer basics, when Yahoo hired her to organize the Canadian sites in its directory.For Ms. Meek personally, it kicked off a 20-year career odyssey through modern Silicon Valley and some of the tech industry\u2019s most significant trends: e-commerce, virtual reality, fraud-fighting \u2014 even a mobile haircut app.When she started, Yahoo was fumbling in Canada. Technically, it had a separate Canada site, but it relied on the American directory for its searches.Employees asked her why the most popular search term among Canadian users was the word Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d Ms. Meek, 41, recalled saying. \u201cIn Canada, you do \u2018government\u2019 and you get American results. So you do \u2018government Canada.\u2019 You do anything and then you add \u2018Canada\u2019 to it.\u201dAfter the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Yahoo\u2019s dysfunctions began to surface. In 2002, the company transferred Ms. Meek\u2019s job to Toronto. Less than 90 days later, it closed that office and sent her and two engineers back to the American headquarters.She got a promotion from the mess: Yahoo put her in charge of the content, ads and business deals for Yahoo Canada. She was nicknamed Captain Canada and had a ringside seat to one of the company\u2019s biggest decisions \u2014 dumping Google as a search partner and switching to technology from its Inktomi acquisition instead. \u201cThey were scared to do it. So they did it in Canada first,\u201d she said.In 2008, she left the company, embarking on a journey through Silicon Valley\u2019s laboratory of business ideas, big and small. First she joined a tiny start-up, Picateers, that was trying to reinvent the school portrait business. It folded a year later.From there she went to Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, the tech industry\u2019s first big foray into virtual reality. Players interacted with one another online in a 3-D simulated world, where they could buy and sell things, make friends, or just gawk at the scenery.Second Life was an extraordinary experiment in human behavior, she said. An employee could change something in the virtual world, then just watch what happened. \u201cYou are literally a god,\u201d she said.Next for her was Eventbrite, an online event-planning and ticketing company. There she worked to protect against credit card fraud.And she says, she is casting about for the next challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny time in my life where there is definitely no script,\u201d she said.Working long hours in close quarters, it was inevitable that some surfers would find romance.For Matthew Mustapick and Amey Mathews, working at Yahoo didn\u2019t just lead to love. The lessons they learned \u2014 and the money they made from the stock they received as early employees \u2014 allowed them to achieve a different kind of Silicon Valley dream: dropping out of tech to do their own thing.Ms. Mathews, who had a fine arts degree from Stanford, joined in 1998 after responding to an ad looking for a speaker of Scandinavian languages. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t speak any Scandinavian languages \u2014 but I speak Italian and you should have someone who speaks Italian,\u201d she recalled during an interview at the couple\u2019s home in Soquel, Calif.Yahoo had an Italian speaker already, but she got a job anyway. Mr. Mustapick sat in a nearby cubicle, and they eventually became a couple.Surfers were free to reflect their personal interests in the directory. Ms. Mathews loved animals and indexed all the dogs, cattle, even miniature donkeys, she could find. Mr. Mustapick was fond of cataloging oddities like prosthetic testicles for pets that had been neutered.Mr. Mustapick left Yahoo in early 2002. Ms. Mathews followed later that year.\u201cI could afford to lose money for a whole year when no one came to my class,\u201d she said.Mr. Mustapick turned toward music. \u201cI always wanted to learn how to play electric guitar like Scott Henderson,\u201d he said, referring to the jazz and blues guitarist. That interest led him in an unexpected direction \u2014 he began building acoustic guitars with an eye toward selling them.Having looked at hundreds of thousands of websites while at Yahoo, he had a good sense of how to market online, well before the era of Twitter and self-promotion as a national pastime. He built a website and posted photos of guitars he was building so customers could watch the progress.And he consciously befriended the right people. \u201cThey just put the word out for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the sort of thing I learned at Yahoo that you could do.\u201dStill, she remembers Yahoo fondly. \u201cI loved being around that many smart, interesting, engaged people,\u201d she said. \u201cI actively miss that in my daily life \u2014 not enough to go get a job and give up what I\u2019m doing, but I do miss it.\u201dNine years ago, Gordon Hurd quit Yahoo for the second time. In June, he began working for the company again \u2014 Round 3 \u2014 this time as a freelance writer.In the intervening years, Mr. Hurd toured the struggling new-media landscape \u2014 first, the Yahoo archrival AOL; then, Interactive One, a network of black news and culture sites; later, First Look Media, created by the eBay founder Pierre M. Omidyar; and most recently, a men\u2019s fashion site, Man\u2019s Life. There was even a brief stint at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm and \u201cthe most corporate place you could go,\u201d he said.Mr. Hurd\u2019s first run with Yahoo started in 1998 when he was hired to organize the business and finance parts of the directory. The starting pay was only $35,000 a year, he recalled. But there were stock options.\u201cI didn\u2019t make millions by any means,\u201d said Mr. Hurd, 45, in a phone interview from Brooklyn, where he lives. But he bought a house.A restless soul, he left Yahoo in 2002 to become an investigative reporter for a local magazine. Less than a year later, with a second child on the way, Mr. Hurd returned to Yahoo, eventually helping run the influential home page.In 2007, he hopped to McKinsey and then quickly to AOL, where he ran Asylum.com, a lifestyle site aimed at men age 18 to 34. The business model was to create vast amounts of content in the hope that visitors would click on ads.That didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWhat it underlined is how much of a commodity content was,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. Asylum was shut down.Mr. Hurd moved on to Interactive One, the digital arm of Radio One, the largest black-owned radio broadcaster in the United States, which struggled to crack the content code, too. Volume trumped quality. \u201cYou know people will click on a subway-fight video, but you want to talk about what it\u2019s like to be a millennial of color,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.Which is how, today, Mr. Hurd is back at Yahoo, writing articles for its style site while he ponders his next move.More than ever, he thinks there is a need for the type of work that Yahoo\u2019s surfers did 20 years ago. \u201cThe web has gotten so big that you need people to curate it,\u201d he said.However, he sees that curation coming from subject experts, not mass-audience sites like Yahoo. Niche sites with a devoted following could work with select sponsors hoping to reach a particular audience, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019s really dedicated to the art of handmade knives, and you set out to categorize the sites of handmade knives, only you can do that. Google can never do that,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.When Becky Uline graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio in 1996, she didn\u2019t really know what she wanted to do with her life. A friend was raving that he had discovered paradise \u2014 living in Northern California and working for a company few people had ever heard of, Yahoo.She and another Bowling Green graduate, Michelle Heimburger, thought it would be a grand adventure. They both got hired as surfers and rented an apartment together.The building was so empty at first that surfers would zip through it on in-line skates. \u201cWe would sleep under our desks,\u201d Ms. Uline, 42, recalled during an interview at her current home in Oakland, Calif.In 2001, Ms. Uline gave her notice. She wanted to travel the world, financed in part by her Yahoo nest egg.Paris became a favorite haunt. \u201cI would sublet my apartment out for a few months and just go and work from wherever,\u201d she said. She freelanced for Yahoo and also tapped the vast network of surfer alumni, landing work at the visual-search start-up SearchMe and elsewhere.Yahoo\u2019s decline is sad, Ms. Uline said, but she still feels a connection. Her closest friends are former Yahoos, including Ms. Heimburger, who married yet another surfer and lives in London.A few months ago, Ms. Uline, said, she dropped Yahoo as her home page, but she missed it and changed it back. \u201cI still use Yahoo search. I want them to get the revenue,\u201d she said.When Yahoo set out to hire surfers, it invented a new job category. The closest match may have been bookstore clerk \u2014 and Kepler\u2019s Books in nearby Menlo Park turned into a recruitment hotbed. About a dozen surfers were hired away from the shop, including ConnieAlice Hungate.Ms. Hungate, 46, is still at Yahoo more than 18 years later, supervising what remains of the surfer team. She said the group, renamed content analysis and management, is still vital to the company\u2019s ambitions to remain a player in web search.Search ads bring in nearly half of Yahoo\u2019s revenue. Under a 2010 deal with Microsoft, Yahoo uses Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine for most basic queries and ads.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, has devoted vast resources to search technology \u2014 particularly on mobile devices \u2014 in an attempt to leapfrog Google, though the company has little to show for it so far.Ms. Hungate said her team helped train Yahoo\u2019s search algorithms to provide more relevant results. The mobile search app, for example, now automatically pulls up suggestions for nearby places to eat when lunchtime rolls around.The Elvis sculpture, a 1998 gift from a Yahoo user, still watches over the department, and the turnip-carving contest is held every Halloween \u2014 with results posted on Flickr, the photo-sharing service owned by Yahoo.Ms. Hungate said she was not worried about what would happen to the surfers if the company was sold. \u201cInformation management is a core need in technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll adapt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Online Video Surges, Publishers Turn to Automation", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byIn a television appearance in early June, Michael W. Ferro Jr., the chairman of the newspaper and magazine publishing company Tronc \u2014 formerly known as Tribune Publishing \u2014 made an astonishing claim.\u201cRight now we\u2019re doing a couple hundred videos a day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we need to be doing 2,000 videos a day.\u201dMr. Ferro\u2019s comments added to mounting confusion over his embattled company\u2019s sudden rebranding. How could a newspaper publisher create nearly three-quarters of a million videos a year?But as jarring as Tronc\u2019s goals may sound, the company\u2019s plan is far from novel. In pursuit of more lucrative video advertising and success on dominant social platforms like Facebook, a growing number of publishers have turned to technology that promises to streamline video production, sometimes to the point of near-full automation.The market for this service is largely split between two companies, Wochit and Wibbitz, which both maintain offices in New York City and Tel Aviv. (Wochit also has an office in London.) Wibbitz\u2019s customers include Bonnier magazines, Hearst, Gannett and the Weather Channel, which uses the service to create local news reports. Customers of Wochit have included Time Inc., CBS Interactive, The Huffington Post, Rotten Tomatoes and NowThis News.\u201cTraditionally we\u2019ve employed teams \u2014 someone out shooting and someone able to cut up and produce the video,\u201d said Chris Pirrone, who manages USA Today\u2019s digital sports publications. \u201cDoing that is one, expensive, and two, takes a while to turn around. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve found these tools useful.\u201dBonnier, publisher of Popular Science and Saveur, recently announced a partnership with Wibbitz. \u201cFor us, as a company with over 30 titles, it really allows us to create a lot more video,\u201d said Sean Holzman, chief digital revenue officer at Bonnier.The two services\u2019 automation features work in similar ways. They analyze, and may summarize, text, be it a script or a traditional news article, and then automatically find photographs and video clips to go with it. The services typically get the videos and images from sources like The Associated Press and Getty Images.Additionally, the tools offer the option to quickly put large animated captions over the videos, in a format that has become popular on Facebook, where videos begin playing automatically and are often watched with the sound off. Each can also supply, through a third party, on-demand human narration; Wibbitz offers computerized voice-overs as well.The level of human intervention before publishing is up to the clients. They can be hands-on from the start, making edits, adding original material and using the tools to speed things along. Or they can let the machines do almost all the work \u2014 betting that it will be good enough for viewers \u2014 or, at least, for advertisers. Wibbitz can scan a website and create a \u201crough cut\u201d video for every published article.Wochit clients produce about 30,000 videos a month, according to the company, a number that has doubled since January. Wibbitz says it has twice as many clients now as it did at the start of the year, and the number of videos published using the company\u2019s software has increased more than sixfold in the same time period.\u201cThe way we see it, we can help you increase your video inventory in a very significant way,\u201d said Zohar Dayan, a co-founder and chief executive of Wibbitz.There is also the promise of money. Many publishers, like Tronc, are searching for ways to increase online revenue, as revenue from web advertising remains stubbornly low and print revenue continues to decline. Video advertisements tend to warrant higher rates than other online ads.Automatically generated videos are appearing in growing numbers on news companies\u2019 websites and social pages, but they\u2019re not always easy to spot. Here are a few examples.Wibbitz and Wochit split advertising revenue with some publishers; Wochit sells subscriptions as well. Some sites are adding the videos on the same page as a related story. Often, the videos \u2014 preloaded with ad spots \u2014 start playing automatically.Tech giants have dabbled in forms of automated video production, albeit for different sorts of customers. In 2014, Facebook generated personalized \u201cLook Back\u201d videos from user profiles to celebrate the company\u2019s 10th anniversary. Last week, the company rolled out a \u201cslide show\u201d feature, which automatically stitches together images from users\u2019 photo collections into short videos, in its iPhone app.In June, Google released the highly automated video production tool YouTube Director, intended to encourage business owners to make video ads.Publishers are cautiously optimistic about the potential of video automation tools, and not just for the pre-existing tasks that they make cheaper and faster. But publishers are keenly aware of how quickly new online formats can be commoditized, and, after years of chasing traffic \u2014 most recently from Google and Facebook \u2014 how rapidly advantages can evaporate.Mr. Pirrone of USA Today said his sites were already moving beyond straightforward conversion of articles into videos.\u201cThe data came back very quickly that text-to-video alone, if you don\u2019t touch it, consumers can quickly recognize it is not a high-quality product,\u201d Mr. Pirrone said.Mr. Dayan of Wibbitz said, \u201cThere still needs to be a human, a process, to give that personal touch.\u201dIn the longer term, publishers\u2019 plans for these tools may be less about industrial-scale article conversion than giving an extra set of tools \u2014 and responsibilities \u2014 to journalists. Publishers described the services as supplemental to more conventional video teams, freeing up resources and letting nonspecialist employees make videos as well.\u201cThe way we create video hasn\u2019t changed in decades,\u201d said Dror Ginzberg, a founder and the chief executive of Wochit, who characterized Wochit\u2019s features as an extension of capabilities and shortcuts provided by existing video production software.As for Tronc and its 2,000-a-day video goal, Wibbitz counts among its investors NantMobile, a firm headed by the biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, who happens to be the second-largest stakeholder in Tronc. Neither company would say whether they had a partnership; representatives for Tronc said that its automated video production would be a mixture of \u201cinternal and external\u201d technologies. Some Tronc properties currently publish videos bearing a Wochit logo; Gannett, which recently initiated a hostile takeover of Tronc, has used Wochit and Wibbitz.In a video created for employees but released publicly in June, Malcolm CasSelle, Tronc\u2019s chief technology officer, laid out his company\u2019s rationale. \u201cThe C.P.M. that we can earn with a video, or visualized content, is significantly higher than a page without it,\u201d he said, referring to advertising rates on news articles.The company stood by its plans. \u201cWhen it comes to video, we can monetize our video best within the player on our site,\u201d said Anne Vasquez, the company\u2019s chief digital officer, referring to a plan to include video on half of all article pages by next year.\u201cVideo is video,\u201d Mr. CasSelle said. \u201cWe\u2019re producing it because it\u2019s strategic and important.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re also going to continue to augment with these tools. It could be that the augmented video is so efficient that it outpaces human-generated video.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo and the Online Universe According to Verizon", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStill, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is.It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations \u2014 advertisers \u2014 that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so.\u201cTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIt\u2019s to appeal to advertisers in a different way.\u201dAlready, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality.But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizon\u2019s existing assets \u2014 phone and data networks that knit together the nation \u2014 might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website \u201cfor the modern bride.\u201dLocation information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well \u2014 all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizon\u2019s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley.And Verizon is eager to change the narrative.Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizon\u2019s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce.Everything about the old-school street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become.Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160,000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans.That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike.This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits.That\u2019s why Lowell McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s empire retention,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and Pok\u00e9mon.It\u2019s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizon\u2019s main moneymaking activity \u2014 selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers.\u201cThere\u2019s not really any synergy between Verizon\u2019s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals.Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues.A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5.5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year.But other new ventures haven\u2019t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizon\u2019s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing.Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isn\u2019t clear. Though the companies aren\u2019t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldn\u2019t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the company\u2019s annual sales.\u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new,\u201d said Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. \u201cPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dMr. Armstrong\u2019s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizon\u2019s forays have already landed the company in hot water.The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew.\u201cThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,\u201d said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it.\u201dGiving advertisers access to smartphone users\u2019 data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesn\u2019t take many complaints to get hauled before the F.C.C.\u201dAnd in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a Verizon-owned site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. \u201cThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,\u201d Mr. Gillula said.Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a well-trafficked home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it co-owns Complex, a men\u2019s lifestyle website.Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted location-based advertising informed by the movements of Verizon\u2019s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the so-called internet of things \u2014 where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web \u2014 augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right industry.\u201dAdvertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. \u201cWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,\u201d said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks.\u201cAdvertisers want to make it work,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interest in supporting and propping up a well-run No. 3.\u201dYet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is \u201cwillful optimism,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger.At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1.2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers.And even if Verizon\u2019s push into digital media doesn\u2019t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo.For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,\u201d said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade.How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation.What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isn\u2019t clear.Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street.So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesn\u2019t regularly break out AOL\u2019s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cloud Computing, an Idea With Old Roots", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byBitsCloud computing may seem like the new big thing in the technology industry. In reality, there\u2019s nothing new about it. It has just had different names over the years.Traditional tech companies like IBM were offering similar services. And if you want to get technical, people had been able to buy \u201ctimesharing\u201d on old mainframes as far back as the 1960s.An A.S.P. was meant to do what a cloud computing company does today \u2014 connect people over the internet to software that is hosted in a giant data center. Instead of owning all that equipment or hiring all the people to manage it, you would pay the A.S.P. to do it for you.There were limitations. Internet connectivity was still slow for most people. Most software wasn\u2019t designed to easily run over the internet, and the software used to manage those computer networks was still wonky. And running the A.S.P. operations was ghastly expensive.One of the pioneers of this young business was Marc Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder who would later become one of the most influential venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. In between, Mr. Andreessen co-founded a company called LoudCloud with his Netscape colleague (and later venture capital partner) Ben Horowitz.The acquisition hasn\u2019t changed the fortunes of HP, which has had more than its own share of troubles.

{"Headline": "Alexa, What Else Can You Do? Getting More From Amazon Echo", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byTech FixBILL PYSZCZYMUKA was installing an air-conditioner in an upstairs window last spring when it occurred to him that there was a way to control the machine without getting up from the couch downstairs: his Amazon Echo.\u201cThe moment of truth came when I asked, \u2018Alexa, turn on the air-conditioner,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe unit beeped upstairs, with Alexa telling me, \u2018O.K.\u2019 I thought it was more than O.K. It was cool.\u201dMr. Pyszczymuka is part of a prolific community of Echo tinkerers who are using the smart speaker for much more than playing music. Since Amazon released the Echo last year, it has quickly become the top-selling home audio speaker on Amazon.com and one of the company\u2019s most successful hardware products. While Amazon, which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, has not revealed how many Echos it has sold, people have put the speaker to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool.So I recently revisited the Echo to unearth some of the best tips to getting the most from Alexa. Here\u2019s a rundown.To change the default music player, open the Alexa smartphone app. Then tap Settings, tap Music and Media, and tap Choose Default Music Services and select Spotify for your default music library or Pandora for your default station service. That way, you no longer have to say \u201cPlay Radiohead on Spotify\u201d or \u201cPlay Radiohead on station Pandora\u201d \u2014 you can just say \u201cPlay Radiohead\u201d or \u201cPlay Radiohead station\u201d and the Echo will play music from your service of choice. (Apple Music and Google Play are not supported by the Echo.)Other audio tricks include the ability to ask Alexa to play specific podcasts \u2014 try speaking a command like \u201cAlexa, Play \u2018Fresh Air\u2019\u201d (the NPR show) or \u201cAlexa, Play \u2018This American Life\u2019\u201d (also from NPR). An often-forgotten feature of the Echo is its ability to play live radio stations from all over the world. Just ask Alexa to play the call letters of your favorite radio station like KQED, and the Echo will stream it.Echo tinkerers have been putting the speaker to work in their kitchens. One reason: you can summon Alexa without touching the device, which makes it extremely helpful while preparing food or putting dishes away.Try these basics to get acquainted with Alexa in the kitchen: After you stick a pie or roast in the oven, ask Alexa to set a timer. Need help tripling a recipe? Ask Alexa to do the math (\u201cAlexa, what is three times 127?\u201d). Need to know how many tablespoons are in a cup? Ask Alexa to make the conversion for you.Alexa can also help restock your kitchen. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and are running out of something like Ziploc bags, just say \u201cAlexa, order Ziploc bags\u201d to place an Amazon order right away. If you prefer to pick up the item at a store, say, \u201cAlexa, add Ziploc bags to my shopping list\u201d to affix items to a shopping list in the Alexa smartphone app. The best part about using Alexa to compile a shopping list is that multiple family members can add to it, even after you have left the house.Now that you\u2019re well acclimated to Alexa, consider some advanced hacks, such as configuring the Echo to control different parts of your home, including the thermostat and the light bulbs. This will require buying more gear.Setting up the Smart Plug takes a few minutes. I plugged a bedroom lamp into the Smart Plug, then downloaded the free smartphone app Kasa, which detected the Smart Plug and connected it to my Wi-Fi network.Then I opened the Alexa smartphone app, added the Kasa \u201cskill\u201d (third-party apps for Alexa are called skills) and connected Alexa with my Smart Plug. I subsequently gave the lamp a friendly name: bedroom lamp. Now at night, I can say \u201cAlexa, turn on the bedroom lamp\u201d to light up the bedroom before I walk down the hall.Another nifty use of Alexa is how it can control a smart thermostat, which I tested with my Wi-Fi-controlled Honeywell thermostat. In the Alexa app, I added the Honeywell skill, then scanned for the thermostat and labeled it Honeywell. Saying \u201cEcho, set Honeywell to 80 degrees\u201d set the heater to that temperature. (Alexa also works with other smart thermostats like Nest and the Ecobee 3.)Larger projects like these are expensive and take more technical skill, so I recommend starting with basics like smart lights, plugs and thermostats. Then you can assess whether you need a much smarter home.Looking for more things to do with Echo? Open the Alexa app and add these three skills \u2014 TV Shows, The Bartender and Uber.Then next time you\u2019re couch-surfing, ask Alexa a question like \u201cAsk TV Shows what time \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 airs\u201d to find out what time the show is on. (The answer: Sunday at 11 p.m. eastern on HBO.)Or when trying a new cocktail recipe, say to Alexa, \u201cAsk the bartender how to make a Manhattan\u201d to get a list of ingredients and instructions. And while you are tying your shoes and getting ready to go out, say, \u201cAlexa, ask Uber to request an UberX\u201d to summon a car to your home.The downside of forming a bond with Echo and Alexa? You will wish it can help you with everything, everywhere \u2014 including filing an expense report on the go or turning down the volume of a loud co-worker.

Verizon is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday.Bankers for Yahoo cast a wide net for the auction, and a number of potential suitors emerged. The field was winnowed down to a handful of bidders, which included AT&T; private equity firms like TPG Capital; and the Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert, who has received the backing of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway.But people involved in the process long believed that Verizon, with its enormous cash pile and its ability to wring out efficiencies by merging Yahoo with AOL, was the most likely winner.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, said that combining AOL with Yahoo would create a stronger No. 3 digital platform for online advertising, after Google and Facebook.\u201cThis is a 1 plus 1 equals 2\u00bd,\u201d he said.No final deal has been reached and the talks could still falter, the person briefed on the matter cautioned. One of the other finalists in the Yahoo auction process could also re-emerge with a higher bid.Yahoo would bring in a huge amount of additional news, sports and finance content \u2014 and the one billion people a month who visit Yahoo services \u2014 and would offer Verizon another set of sophisticated ad technologies.Yahoo\u2019s BrightRoll division in particular is a leader in delivering automated, real-time advertising, and could be merged with AOL\u2019s ad technology to deliver more appealing options to marketers, particularly in video.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be anybody\u2019s first port of call,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cBut they will have a deeper set of data than anyone except Facebook and Google.\u201dThat prospect alarms privacy advocates but elates marketers.\u201cGoogle has access to me on my mobile phone but is kind of missing the cable box and internet access data that Verizon has,\u201d said Shar VanBoskirk, a digital marketing analyst at the research firm Forrester.Consumers feel warmly about Yahoo as a brand, Ms. VanBoskirk said, even if they do not use many Yahoo services. By contrast, she added, \u201cpeople have a pretty negative attitude towards telecom.\u201d She said Verizon could rebrand some of its services with the Yahoo name to increase their appeal.Any purchase of Yahoo carries some real risks, however. In addition to the F.C.C. rules that would make the data sharing less valuable, integrating ad platforms is a complex challenge, usually plagued with delays. The companies also have a different incentive structure for their advertising sales forces, according to Mr. Wieser, and unifying them could be disruptive.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Advertisement"}

Sometimes it\u2019s just plain great.Revenue rose to $21.5 billion, about $750 million more than analysts were predicting and a 21 percent jump from a year earlier.Earnings per share after excluding certain items was $8.42, or 39 cents more than forecasts. Last year, it was $6.99.Celebration ensued. Alphabet\u2019s shares, which drifted sideways during regular trading, immediately rose 4 percent after hours.In some ways, the quarter was the mirror image of the previous quarter, which was good but not as great as analysts hoped. That knocked the stock back and induced some hand-wringing \u2014 never far below the surface with even the best and most successful internet companies \u2014 that Google\u2019s days of dominance in search and advertising might be on the verge of starting to wane.No such worries were on display on Thursday as executives talked to analysts. Google rose to fame and fortune on desktop searches, but the health of the company is now reflected in its presence on people\u2019s phones, not only with advertising but also with its Android operating system.\u201cThe strength of the quarter is about mobile,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of the Google division where most of the company\u2019s revenue and profits are made. \u201cIt\u2019s transformed the way that people consume information, and Google\u2019s products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience.\u201dLast fall, Google revamped its ad formats and delivery, which have been powering the increase in revenue. The number of paid clicks in the second quarter increased 29 percent from last year, the same rate as in the first quarter. Aggregate cost per click fell 9 percent from 2015, the same drop as in the first quarter.Mr. Pichai\u2019s lengthy prepared remarks took a long-term perspective, focusing on the importance of machine learning \u2014 software that adjusts to the user\u2019s experience. It will be, he promised, the source of the next great innovations after the switch to mobile runs its course.Revenue for these \u201cother bets\u201d was $185 million, driven largely by Google Fiber; the thermostat company, Nest; and Verily, a life sciences company. Alphabet said it lost $859 million on \u201cother bets\u201d in the second quarter, more than the $660 million loss a year ago.Alphabet does not break down how many employees work at the moonshots, but in general the company\u2019s head count is rising almost as fast as its revenue. More than 66,000 people now work at the company, up nearly 17 percent over the last year.Some analysts predict that Google will sooner or later need innovation closer to home than its moonshots, somewhat in the mode of the ceaselessly inventive Amazon or Apple.\u201cAmazon took their retailing platform and built a multibillion-dollar stream of web services. Apple is increasingly talking about money from services, not just hardware,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cGoogle needs things that expand beyond advertising to give it greater breadth.\u201dGoogle could eventually be forced to pay billion-dollar fines. It would not miss the money but if the cases succeed in distracting the company and tempering its innovations, that could be a real problem for management and ultimately shareholders. On Thursday, no one seemed unduly worried about this possibility.Advertisement"}

What happens to my favorite Yahoo services now that Verizon is buying the company?After the deal closes, Verizon intends to keep Yahoo and its services as separate brands, according to Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of Verizon\u2019s AOL unit. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands in the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be investing in it.\u201dWait, AOL? Verizon owns AOL? So will my Yahoo email become AOL email?No, Yahoo Mail is one of the company\u2019s most successful services and Verizon plans to keep it separate.What about other Yahoo services, like fantasy sports and Yahoo Finance?Mr. Armstrong said that the two companies have not yet sat down to work out all the transition plans, but the intention is to keep Yahoo\u2019s content sites and apps.Will Verizon keep Yahoo search? Will I still see the Yahoo search box in my Firefox browser?The future of search is fuzzier. Yahoo\u2019s current chief executive, Marissa Mayer, has invested heavily in search, but the company has continued to lose ground to Google.Mr. Armstrong was noncommittal on search, saying that would be a topic of discussion between the two companies. \u201cYahoo has products that have not launched yet on search,\u201d he said, and Verizon wants to evaluate those.Under Yahoo\u2019s search partnership with Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser, anyone who buys Yahoo must offer a search product through the end of 2019 or pay a hefty breakup fee.What about my personal data? Will Verizon share data about my cellphone use to Yahoo\u2019s advertisers and will Yahoo use what it knows about my web surfing to sell ads on my phone?The Federal Communications Commission fined Verizon in March for tracking people\u2019s cellphone browsing habits without their consent. Now the company is banned from sharing data across its business units unless it gets the user\u2019s permission.But the F.C.C. is considering broader rules to govern such data sharing, and Verizon is one of several companies lobbying to loosen the restrictions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Owner\u2019s Manual, Out of the Glove Box and Onto the App", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byWheelsTHE recent death of the actor Anton Yelchin has spurred a class-action lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler, maker of the 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee that rolled backward after he stepped out and crushed him.Other Jeep and Chrysler owners, citing many similar accidents \u2014 if no other deaths \u2014 say that the transmission shifter used in his car and some other models is confusing and not intuitive.A quick read of the owner\u2019s manual might have helped some drivers avoid thinking the car was safely in parking gear when it was not.But whatever one\u2019s opinion is of a car gear shifter that requires special instructions to operate, an anomaly of the Fiat Chrysler fiasco is this: The company is actually an industry leader when it comes to providing state-of-the-art user guides for its increasingly complex vehicles.The automaker offers an array of smartphone apps, web videos and other digital means for letting owners know how to drive their cars. (The app\u2019s instructions for the 2015 Grand Cherokee gearshift, accompanied by a photo illustration, flag an important point that perhaps too many people have missed, \u201cThe electronic shift lever in this vehicle does not slide like a conventional shifter.\u201d)Along with other carmakers, Fiat Chrysler has come to realize that consumers these days are as unlikely to read the voluminous owner\u2019s manual traditionally stuffed in the glove box as they are to read a printed telephone book.So auto companies increasingly are using apps, onscreen displays, videos and other technological means to familiarize the digitally adept buyer with the multitude of features in their highly computerized vehicles.\u201cThe question is, What do millennials expect from their cars, now that they view them as an operating system?\u201d said Prof. Maggie Hendrie, chairwoman of the Interaction Design program at ArtCenter College of Design, in Los Angeles.\u201cToday, we learn about a car\u2019s functions through trial and error,\u2019\u2019 Professor Hendrie said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we expect context-specific help built into the vehicle.\u201dOr we might look at the YouTube videos created by vehicle fans, as well as online forums populated by a particular make\u2019s enthusiasts, which often provide better answers than the pages written by a manufacturer.\u201cIf I ever had an issue with my car, I\u2019d do a Google search before I read the manual,\u201d said Akshay Anand, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.In some ways Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and other digital adopters are simply trying to catch up to their user communities. But they are also adopting digital instructions because cars have become so complex and feature-laden that printed manuals, with their step-by-step instructions and myriad legal warnings, are becoming unwieldy.If Fiat Chrysler still printed its manual, it would be 700 pages long and contain 240,000 words, said Tricia Hecker, head of the company\u2019s connected vehicle group. (Longer, for comparison\u2019s sake, than Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u2019\u2019)Fiat Chrysler first went to a digital user\u2019s guide in 2009, mainly as a money-saving step when the company was in dire financial straits. But the initial effort was blandly utilitarian. \u201cIt was just a regurgitation of the printed manual,\u201d Ms. Hecker said.Today, though, the company offers smartphone app versions of all its vehicle manuals. Users can search for instructions by topic, concept or alphabetically. Videos are often embedded in the instructions.The Fiat Chrysler app also gives users a place to write and email pertinent information after an accident, as well as a listing of maintenance schedules, active recalls and an accessory shop.Toyota\u2019s owner\u2019s manuals are available as smartphone apps and on the website. But rather than being reimagined for the screen, Toyota\u2019s digital manuals are simply shrunken pages of the paper ones. The company also continues to offer paper manuals in all its vehicles, to accommodate older buyers.\u201cWe\u2019re sticking with paper; some generations love the paper version,\u201d said Brian Williams, head of the company\u2019s marketing and product education division. \u201cSometimes you may not have your phone or be near a website, and it\u2019s also a lot quicker to flip through the paper index.\u201dFor those willing to click beyond the mini-manual pages, Toyota offers how-to videos. The app also displays explanations of dashboard warnings and can be used to schedule service, view the vehicle\u2019s service history or request roadside assistance.\u201cPeople don\u2019t see manuals as something you can learn from,\u201d said Manish Mehrotra, senior group manager for digital business and connected operations at Hyundai.Although Hyundai still provides paper manuals and web-based PDF versions, the company has also introduced an augmented-reality feature to its app. Point the smartphone at the engine, exterior, or interior of one of its vehicles, and an exploded three-dimensional view of various parts appear on the screen, with explanatory videos and operating instructions.Limited augmented reality is also available with Fiat Chrysler\u2019s owners\u2019 app. By hovering a smartphone over the vehicle instrument cluster, users can read text-based explanations of each warning light\u2019s function.An owner\u2019s app for BMWs performs a similar function to help users solve the riddles of the various buttons in the car.Manufacturers are also beginning to make some of the information on the smartphone apps available through the vehicle\u2019s dashboard digital display. Fiat Chrysler has done so for its Chrysler 300 and Pacifica models, as well as the Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger, showing users how to connect a garage door opener to the vehicle\u2019s controls.Since this migration, use of the app\u2019s help feature has risen to 16 percent of owners, from only 5 percent before, Ms. Hecker said.Tesla, the maker of expensive all-electric cars, has always offered its owner\u2019s guide through its vehicles\u2019 giant 17-inch touch screens. And just as a Tesla car regularly receives software updates from the cloud to alter the vehicle\u2019s functionality, so too is the instruction manual always kept up-to-date via software downloads.Future systems will not always wait for a driver to ask how to do something. Instead, they might sense what the driver needs and proactively offer to help. Chrysler, for example, is at work on an app that would not merely offer an explanation of how to connect a garage door to the vehicle\u2019s HomeLink system but also notice when the driver has not done it and ask if he or she would like to know how.In a system under development at Hyundai, once an owner begins to schedule service and indicates what times would be convenient, the car\u2019s screen will offer a list of available appointment times.\u201cThe printed car manual feels like a relic,\u201d said Professor Hendrie. \u201cImagine a dynamic manual that gives you information, just in time, knowing who you are, and how you\u2019re driving. It\u2019s up to us to figure out how people learn today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The frog smartly refuses because, well, it\u2019s a scorpion. But the scorpion says that if he stings the frog while they are in the water, they\u2019ll both die.The frog accepts this logic, takes the scorpion on his back and goes into the water.

The tech overlords keep clear of writers who are not on their payrolls or at least in their thrall. Many in the valley feel that bringing the digital future to the masses is God\u2019s work. Question this, and they tend to get touchy. Anger them, and they might seek revenge. The billionaire investor Peter Thiel, outed by the local arm of the Gawker media empire, secretly financed a lawsuit to destroy it. Silicon Valley did not rise en masse and say this was seriously beyond the pale. No surprise, then, that there are so few books investigating what it really takes to succeed in tech (duplicity often trumps innovation) or that critically examine such omnipresent, comforting fables as \u201cWe\u2019re not in it for the money.\u201dThere are other barriers to literature. A start-up is less a physical reality than the hype that surrounds it. (It\u2019s not lying if you believe it.) Boasts, threats, secret deals, betrayals are the coin of the realm, but lawsuits and news releases are the only things put in writing. Nailing this slippery culture would take an unholy combination of David Mamet and Tom Wolfe in their primes, but they would also have to be lucky enough to find a subject who did not realize he was a great subject and start censoring himself for fear he would never be hired again. Good luck with that.In the meantime, we have the next best thing: Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s \u201cChaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,\u201d a book whose bland all-purpose title belies the fact that this is a valley account like no other. The first hint that something is different here comes with the dedication: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d This is autobiography as revenge, naming names and sparing few, certainly not the author. \u201cI was wholly devoid of most human boundaries or morality,\u201d he notes in passing. In other words, he was a start-up chief executive.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez came to the valley in 2008 from Goldman Sachs, where he was a pricing quant who modeled credit derivatives. In the valley, he tried to do the same with chunks of human attention, which meant inventing digital ad systems. He started at a flailing firm named \u00adAdchemy; quit with two engineers to found a start-up; sold the start-up to Twitter but went himself to work for Facebook, where he lasted two years.Flatly summarized, it is not a very interesting career. The start-up, named AdGrok, was a company mostly in name; it was three guys in a dumpy room trying to hustle themselves in a world full of hustlers. The answer to the problem plaguing Facebook during Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s stint there \u2014 how can we use digital advertising to make some serious money? \u2014 was not solved by the author.No matter. Michael Lewis was never a top Wall Street bond salesman, but in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d he captured an era. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d aims to do the same for Silicon Valley, and bracingly succeeds. Nothing I\u2019ve ever read conveys better what it actually is like to be in the engine room of the start-up economy. There were moments I laughed out loud, something I never recall doing while reading about Steve Jobs. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez shows how a start-up is less about making a product that actually does something than desperately demonstrating you are worthy of being hired by Google, Twitter or Facebook. He describes the way the big companies resemble life in Cuba or Communist China circa 1965, with \u201cendless toil motivated by lapidary ideals handed down by a revered and unquestioned leader,\u201d not to mention the posters on the wall proclaiming, \u201cProceed and Be Bold!\u201d This is a place, he points out, where people take their laptops into a toilet stall and keep typing as they do what they came to do. If that strikes you as unseemly or unnecessary, you\u2019ll never make it in Palo Alto.The heart of the book is the period Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez spent at his start-up, which was intended to allow small businesses to efficiently advertise on Google. It was an auspicious moment. While the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the recession, the office parks of the valley were full of aggressive young men who had made pots of money by being early employees of Google. To prove they were not merely lucky, they needed to score again. Everyone was terrified of missing the next Facebook or, a little later, the next Airbnb or Uber. Smart entrepreneurs capitalized on these fears.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s big break was hyping his way into Y Combinator, in effect the valley\u2019s finishing school for innovators. He labels the YC entrepreneur profile as \u201cbomb-throwing anarchist subversive mixed with coldblooded execution mixed with irreverent whimsy, a sort of \u00adtechnology-enabled 12-year-old boy.\u201d He fit right in.Graduation from Y Combinator conveys the same prestige that a degree from Harvard does back East, and comes complete with an old boy \u2014 well, young men \u2014 network that is handy in all sorts of ways. \u201cAnyone who claims the valley is meritocratic is someone who has profited vastly from it via nonmeritocratic means like happenstance, membership in a privileged cohort or some concealed act of absolute skulduggery,\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez observes. All three helped AdGrok; at one point the author manipulated the numbers for his investors, \u201ccooking the books in the worst form. But it was either that or give up now, and surrender was unthinkable.\u201dThere are a few problems with \u201cChaos Monkeys.\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez likes footnotes way too much (on one page there are four) and the epigraphs to each chapter are numbingly heavy-handed, although the Latin American proverb about how for every beautiful woman there\u2019s a man tired of making love to her sums up nicely his feelings about leaving the Kingdom of Facebook. More problematically, there is much more about digital ad technology here than most readers could possibly want. The implications of the technology, on the other hand, are somewhat scanted.\u201cImagine that every time you go to CNN.com, it\u2019s as though a new sell order for one share in your brain is transmitted to a stock exchange,\u201d he writes. \u201cPicture it: Individual quanta of human attention sold, bit by bit, like so many million shares of General Motors stock, billions of times a day.\u201d That was the world Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was doing his best to create. For all his criticism of the valley\u2019s way of doing things, he never stops to wonder about ethics.But then, he\u2019s got a full plate. Early in the narrative Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez conceives a daughter with a woman a mere two weeks after they meet. \u201cIf you jump into the abyss, jump headlong,\u201d he observes. Eighteen months or so later, during breakup sex, a son is conceived. AdGrok officially opens for business on his daughter\u2019s first birthday, which he skipped. \u201cSuccess,\u201d he writes, \u201cforgives all sins.\u201dIn the end, though, his success as an entrepreneur was only middling. \u201cSuch is the greased pole of Silicon Valley fame and power; anyone can try to ascend, but nothing will arrest your fall,\u201d he writes. First prize in Silicon Valley is enough money so your family and descendants will never have to work again until the sun goes cold. Second prize is a whole heaping pile of money. Third prize is you\u2019re fired, which is often pretty sweet too. Three years after being escorted out of Facebook, Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez is living on a 40-foot sailboat on San Francisco Bay.David Streitfeld covers Silicon Valley for The Times.

{"Headline": "How Anti-Growth Sentiment, Reflected in Zoning Laws, Thwarts Equality", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byBOULDER, Colo. \u2014 The small city of Boulder, home to the University of Colorado\u2019s flagship campus, has a booming local economy and a pleasantly compact downtown with mountain views. Not surprisingly, a lot of people want to move here.Something else is also not surprising: Many of the people who already live in Boulder would prefer that the newcomers settle somewhere else.\u201cThe quality of the experience of being in Boulder, part of it has to do with being able to go to this meadow and it isn\u2019t just littered with human beings,\u201d said Steve Pomerance, a former city councilman who moved here from Connecticut in the 1960s.All of Boulder\u2019s charms are under threat, Mr. Pomerance said as he concluded an hourlong tour. Rush-hour traffic has become horrendous. Quaint, two-story storefronts are being dwarfed by glass and steel. Cars park along the road to the meadow.These days, you can find a Steve Pomerance in cities across the country \u2014 people who moved somewhere before it exploded and now worry that growth is killing the place they love.But a growing body of economic literature suggests that anti-growth sentiment, when multiplied across countless unheralded local development battles, is a major factor in creating a stagnant and less equal American economy.One reason they\u2019re not migrating to places with better job prospects is that rich cities like San Francisco and Seattle have gotten so expensive that working-class people cannot afford to move there. Even if they could, there would not be much point, since whatever they gained in pay would be swallowed up by rent.In Boulder, for instance, the median home price has risen 60 percent over the last five years, to $648,200. Today, someone who makes the typical Boulder salary would have to put about 40 percent their monthly income toward payments on a new mortgage or about half toward rent, according to Zillow.\u201cWe\u2019ve switched from a world where everybody educated and uneducated was moving from poorer parts of the country to the richer parts of the country,\u201d said Professor Shoag, \u201cto a world where the higher-educated people move to San Francisco and lower educated people move to Vegas.\u201dZoning restrictions have been around for decades but really took off during the 1960s, when the combination of inner-city race riots and \u201cwhite flight\u201d from cities led to heavily zoned suburbs.They have gotten more restrictive over time, contributing to a jump in home prices that has been a bonanza for anyone who bought early in places like Boulder, San Francisco and New York City. But for latecomers, the cost of renting an apartment or buying a home has become prohibitive.In response, a group of politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown of California and President Obama, are joining with developers in trying to get cities to streamline many of the local zoning laws that, they say, make homes more expensive and hold too many newcomers at bay.To most people, zoning and land-use regulations might conjure up little more than images of late-night City Council meetings full of gadflies and minutiae. But these laws go a long way toward determining some fundamental aspects of life: what American neighborhoods look like, who gets to live where and what schools their children attend.And when zoning laws get out of hand, economists say, the damage to the American economy and society can be profound. Studies have shown that laws aimed at things like \u201cmaintaining neighborhood character\u201d or limiting how many unrelated people can live together in the same house contribute to racial segregation and deeper class disparities. They also exacerbate inequality by restricting the housing supply in places where demand is greatest.\u201cYou don\u2019t want rules made entirely for people that have something, at the expense of people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.So far, the biggest solution offered comes out of California, where Governor Brown has proposed a law to speed up housing development by making it harder for cities to saddle developers with open-ended design, permit and environmental reviews. The Massachusetts State Senate passed similar reforms. And President Obama has taken a more soft-touch approach, proposing $300 million in grants to prod local governments to simplify their building regulations.Mr. Brown\u2019s proposal has inflamed local politicians, environmentalists and community groups, who see it as state overreach into how they regulate development. But it has drawn broad support from developers, not surprisingly, as well as a number of business leaders, including many from the technology industry.To understand how a bunch of little growth laws make their way into existence, consider how well Boulder is doing \u2014 and why it has made people wary of promoting local growth.The city, about a 45-minute drive from Denver, is surrounded by postcard views of the Rockies. The list of yuppie-friendly amenities includes streets full of bike lanes and a walkable downtown full of bars, restaurants and marijuana shops. It has the charms of a resort town with the bonus that, unlike a resort town, it has more than ski lift and bartending jobs.The result is a virtuous economic cycle in which the university churns out smart people, the smart people attract employers, and the amenities make everyone want to stay. Twitter is expanding its offices downtown. A few miles away, a big hole full of construction equipment marks a new Google campus that will allow the company to expand its Boulder work force to 1,500 from 400.Looking to slow the pace of development, last year a citizens\u2019 group called Livable Boulder \u2014 Mr. Pomerance was involved in the effort \u2014 pushed a pair of local ballot measures that would have increased fees on new development and given neighborhood groups a vote on zoning changes in their area.Will Toor, Boulder\u2019s former mayor, who worked for the \u201cno\u201d campaign, said, \u201cYou would never build affordable housing, you would never build community facilities like homeless shelters \u2014 those things would just never happen if you had all veto power at the neighborhood level.\u201dVoters shot the measures down, but development is almost certain to remain the city\u2019s most contentious issue.\u201cWe don\u2019t need one more job in Boulder,\u201d Mr. Pomerance said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to grow anymore. Go somewhere else where they need you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This was Pok\u00e9mon Go, an augmented-reality smartphone app that has captured the minds and playful spirits of millions worldwide.The game is not incredibly complex. You\u2019re asked to create a character \u2014 a Pok\u00e9mon trainer with a semi-customizable avatar \u2014 and essentially do the same thing you were doing in the Pok\u00e9mon of old: Collect as many monsters as you can, wherever you can.The twist is: The monsters are let loose in the real world, spread across a digitally mapped overlay of your surroundings (based on Google\u2019s mapping service). Users capture Pok\u00e9mon that pop up at random on the map by pointing their smartphone cameras at them and tossing \u201cPok\u00e9 Balls\u201d until the monsters are subdued.Despite its age (the first iteration appeared in Japan more than 20 years ago), Pok\u00e9mon has never really gone away. The game and its many licenses and forms still rake in about $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually.But Pok\u00e9mon Go feels like something altogether different. I\u2019m not gaming inside my living room, playing on a console from my couch. I\u2019m out in parks with throngs of people of all ages, climbing over hills and seeing landmarks I hadn\u2019t otherwise paid attention to before.Even on the block outside of my house, I\u2019m meeting players who live in my neighborhood. I\u2019ve run into one man and his boyfriend three times over the weekend, and they\u2019ve consistently given me tips on the locations of rare nearby Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019ve gotten a few knowing winks and nods from others, too, as if to say we are both part of some open secret, searchers in the real world.I can foresee certain perils. Phone theft is all too common in San Francisco, and traversing Golden Gate Park or wandering through dark parking lots at midnight is not a good idea when you aren\u2019t gaming, much less when you\u2019re carrying an $800 smartphone. Crime will happen, people will do stupid things \u2014 and they\u2019ll make headlines as novelty news.But I can\u2019t help admitting, somewhat reluctantly, the fun I had wandering around my city, catching these goofy monsters and talking to other people about how to do it. Even though I didn\u2019t play much as a kid, Pok\u00e9mon is a cultural touchstone of my youth, something that stoked a sense of nostalgia \u2014 and something I suddenly became invested in.I found myself being advised by a 15-year-old, conversing with people my age and interacting with folks much older than I. (Another perk: After being outside in the California sun for three days, I got quite a nice tan.)It\u2019s difficult to tell if the fervor will last. Smartphone games have a tendency to rise quickly and fall just as fast, a hits-driven business built on the promise of the sequel. I could see the masses moving on to the next big thing as the summer comes to an end, or perhaps when their legs begin to tire from walking more than they\u2019re used to.But for now, I am happy with this new little world, and happy to be a part of a nerdy club where I can go up to someone else on the street and ask, \u201cHave you seen that nearby Snorlax?\u201d without being considered mentally ill.I\u2019ll take it \u2014 at least, until the next thing comes and captures everyone\u2019s attention.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Verizon Announces $4.8 Billion Deal for Yahoo\u2019s Internet Business", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byThe fate of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who came under sharp shareholder criticism for failing to arrest the company\u2019s long downward spiral during her four-year tenure, is unclear.In an interview, Ms. Mayer said, \u201cI plan to stay. I love Yahoo and I want to see it into its next chapter.\u201d But she and Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, said it had not yet been decided if she would have a role at the company after the deal closed in early 2017.If she is terminated, she will be due severance of about $57 million. If she received that payout, her total compensation from Yahoo for her service so far would be about $218 million, according to the compensation research firm Equilar.Verizon, which has a vast amount of information about its customers\u2019 internet use, hopes the combination will help it create a strong No. 3 challenger to Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Mr. Armstrong said the acquisition strengthens Verizon\u2019s offerings to advertisers and consumers and gives it much more scale, since Yahoo claims one billion users who visit at least once a month.\u201cThis deal is a leap forward from serving millions of customers to billions,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said in an interview. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands on the planet.\u201dVerizon plans to keep most of Yahoo\u2019s current products, including its still popular email service, and invest in them to make them stronger. \u201cOur strategy is to structure ourselves as a house of brands,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. However, he said that Verizon has not yet decided what it wants to do in search, an area where Yahoo has waged a losing fight against Google for a decade.The Yahoo purchase carries risks for Verizon, which is well known for its wireless phone and internet services but has little experience in the cutthroat business of digital content. Analysts say that its purchase of AOL has yet to prove its value, although Mr. Armstrong is a well regarded operator.Ms. Mayer said Verizon would help Yahoo get better distribution for its mobile apps in areas like search, mail, news, weather and sports. Verizon, she said, could promote Yahoo services on its smartphones and in its retail stores.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cWe set out to transform this company \u2014 and we\u2019ve made incredible progress. We counteracted many of the tectonic shifts of declining legacy businesses, and built a Yahoo that is unequivocally stronger, nimbler and more modern,\u201d she wrote.Verizon agreed to pay an extra $1.1 billion on top of the purchase price to cash out Yahoo employees\u2019 restricted stock upon the close of the deal, Yahoo said. Many employees, particularly the senior executives, are also entitled to large severance packages if they are fired by Verizon.\u201cIt does mark the end of a particular time period for the company,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cThat said, there are great opportunities for Yahoo, for the brand, for the services, with Verizon.\u201dAfter the close of the deal, Yahoo shareholders will still own shares in what is left of the company, essentially an investment fund with two holdings: a 15 percent stake, worth about $32 billion based on its recent share price, in the Chinese internet company Alibaba; and a 35.5 percent stake, worth about $8.7 billion, in Yahoo Japan.The sale, which still must be approved by Yahoo shareholders and regulators, also does not include Yahoo\u2019s cash and its noncore patents, which it is trying to sell separately.\u201cFor investors, this came to the expected conclusion: Verizon was the front-runner very early on,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cThe real question for investors now is what\u2019s next?

{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Charges in Europe Need Quick Action", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe European Commission has hit Google with a third antitrust charge. This time it says the tech company abused its search dominance on third-party websites. It also reinforced a claim, first made in 2010, that Google favored its own shopping service.A speedier, more focused campaign would better serve justice.The newest charge hits closest to the heart of Google\u2019s empire. The company makes about 90 percent of its revenue from advertising. The commission claims Google acted anti-competitively by forcing onerous contracts on companies that used its search service on their sites. For example, a newspaper would use the service to let readers search its archive, or a retailer would allow shoppers to look for merchandise. These partners were obliged to prominently place a minimum number of ads served by Google and were forbidden to use rival search companies to place ads.Google\u2019s 80 percent share of this market gives it plenty of power to act abusively. These contracts, as well as provisions requiring third parties to receive Google\u2019s approval before making any change to the display of competing search ads, skirted the line and may have overstepped it.The commission is confronting Google on other fronts. It accuses the company of forcing handset manufacturers using its Android operating system to install Google apps and bundle services and apps together. That\u2019s a potentially strong case, as similar behavior landed Microsoft in trouble.Then there\u2019s the charge that Google favors its own comparison shopping services. The commission has now added more evidence to its underwhelming claims. There is little evidence consumers were harmed, and it is a minor service for the search giant. Yet regulators have pursued this charge since 2010. The newest charges add yet more time to the clock, giving Google another eight weeks to reply.That is a long time, considering the speed with which the tech market shifts. Facebook has tripled its active users and multiplied its revenue ninefold during the commission\u2019s inquiry into Google\u2019s shopping service. Regulators need to be thorough, but they also must hit companies fast and hard with strong charges aimed at the heart of abusive business practices. The commission\u2019s slow and scattered approach is an ineffective way to curb tech monopolies.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Theresa May Is Poised to Be Britain\u2019s Next Prime Minister", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Theresa May emerged on Monday as Britain\u2019s next prime minister, becoming the second woman, after Margaret Thatcher, to hold that post. She faces multiple challenges as soon as she takes office, from negotiating the nation\u2019s departure from the European Union to addressing deep social and political divisions to reviving a wounded economy.Her victory came on another day of rapid developments in British politics and set in motion a process that officials said would put her in 10 Downing Street by Wednesday night, succeeding David Cameron.A Conservative like Mrs. Thatcher, who governed from 1979 to 1990, Ms. May, 59, has won a reputation for steeliness in her tenure as home secretary. She has pledged to negotiate a deal to leave the European Union that would reassert Britain\u2019s ability to control immigration, a central issue in the referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the bloc.Yet unlike Mrs. Thatcher, Ms. May is seen as a relative moderate and on Monday she promised to address inequality, give workers greater representation on corporate boards and limit tax cuts.Ms. May said that she was \u201chonored and humbled\u201d to be chosen for the job, promised to get the best deal over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and vowed to create an economy that works not for the \u201cprivileged few,\u201d but for all.The British referendum on June 23 plunged the European Union into crisis. It left Britain rudderless as the pound sank in value and both the governing and opposition parties engaged in fierce and acrimonious leadership battles. Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday.Mr. Cameron\u2019s statement completed a day of high political drama in which Ms. May\u2019s rival for the Conservative Party leadership, Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, withdrew from the race. Leading party members quickly coalesced around Ms. May, insisting that the contest should not be reopened. A party committee agreed.Ms. Leadsom had already faced accusations \u2014 which she denied \u2014 of embellishing her curriculum vitae, but her campaign ran aground over the weekend after The Times of London published an interview in which she suggested that she was a better candidate because she is a mother, while Ms. May is not.Surrounded by supportive lawmakers, Ms. Leadsom on Monday made no reference to that issue, but said that she was quitting the contest and endorsing Ms. May, and that she hoped to see her installed as prime minister \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dThe turn of events meant that Ms. May would become prime minister without a general election and without completing the campaign she and Ms. Leadsom had been waging for the endorsement of the Conservative Party\u2019s rank-and-file members.Last week, the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke described Ms. May as a \u201cbloody difficult woman,\u201d noting that he had worked for another female politician of similar temperament, namely Mrs. Thatcher.Far from being insulted, Ms. May used the comment to suggest that her negotiating stance with European officials would be as tough as that of Mrs. Thatcher, who went into battle on the Continent, particularly over British financial contributions to the bloc.\u201cKen Clarke might have found me to be a \u2018bloody difficult woman.\u2019 The next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker,\u201d she told fellow Conservative lawmakers, referring to the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive, ITV reported.But in a speech on Monday, Ms. May outlined an economic agenda unlike that of Mrs. Thatcher, calling for new mechanisms to curb executive pay and warning big multinational companies that they must pay their share of taxes.Ms. May has also been compared to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany who, like Ms. May, is the daughter of a clergyman and is known for her no-nonsense, methodical and pragmatic approach.The post-referendum turmoil in Britain has also gripped the opposition Labour Party, prompting a challenge against its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of not campaigning hard enough against a British withdrawal from Europe. There were growing fears on Monday that the party might split because of the bitter dispute.Nevertheless, opposition politicians called for a general election and questioned Ms. May\u2019s democratic mandate, since she will assume the job on the basis of an internal transfer of power within the governing party. So far, Ms. May has rejected the notion of a quick general election.Her top priority will be to frame a negotiating strategy for leaving the union, after the referendum in which she sided with those who wanted to remain.On Monday, Ms. May insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d as she sought to reassure right-wingers that she was committed to the policy, adding that \u201cthere will be no attempt to remain inside the E.U. There will be no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, no second referendum.\u201dBut, while 52 percent of voters supported Brexit, they did so for differing reasons, including reasserting national sovereignty and opposition to migration from within the bloc, which guarantees the right to live and work within any member nation.Ms. May is expected to take a tough stance on immigration in part because she is politically vulnerable on the issue. As home secretary, she failed to fulfill a Conservative pledge to control the number of people arriving in Britain. The numbers persistently exceeded targets and included arrivals of non-Europeans, which the government had the power to curb.Ms. May has signaled her intention to restrict migration from Europe, even if doing so hurt Britain\u2019s position in negotiating a new trade deal with the bloc. She will also be under pressure from big business to secure the best possible access to Europe\u2019s single market, which normally entails accepting the principle of free movement of workers across national frontiers.One important question for Ms. May is when to invoke Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s governing treaty, which starts the withdrawal procedure. That effectively sets a two-year deadline for a deal to be struck. She has suggested that she intends to wait until her government has settled on its negotiating stance before invoking the article despite pressure from Europe\u2019s leaders to act more quickly.On Monday she said more about her wider political agenda in a speech that offered plans to address some of the economic and social inequalities evident in Britain. Those include populist resentments thought to have motivated many pro-Brexit voters in economically depressed areas outside London and in the affluent southeast of England.\u201cThere is a growing divide between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. And there is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,\u201d she said, positioning herself in a centrist tradition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism.Speaking in Birmingham, England, Ms. May also called for efforts to increase productivity, for employees and consumers to gain seats on company boards and for votes on executive pay to become binding rather than advisory. Big multinationals should pay their share of taxes, she said, adding: \u201cWhether you\u2019re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on July 12 about the emergence of Theresa May as Britain\u2019s new prime minister referred incorrectly in some editions to her place in British history. She is the second woman to serve as Britain\u2019s prime minister, not the \u201csecond woman after Margaret Thatcher\u201d to do so.Advertisement"}

Du Bois poses in his house at 31 Grace Court, near the Brooklyn Bridge.All of these portraits and more were taken in 1958 by the commercial and fine-art photographer David Attie while he was on assignment for Holiday magazine. They spent decades boxed away and never published and, in many cases, his negatives were only recently printed.One of the photos of Capote, shadowy and composed in the crook of the staircase \u2014 \u201cfloating upward in white, swan-simple curves to a skylight of sunny amber-gold glass,\u201d as Capote once described it \u2014 has a Hitchcockian quality. Other images are atmospheric glimpses of an era that feels both bygone (horse-drawn wagons for delivering flowers) and ever-present (children on the stoops of Brooklyn\u2019s classic brownstones).The show \u201creally captures that time when Brooklyn Heights was not the wealthy place that it was in the mid-1800s, when it was the original suburbs, and certainly not the place it is now, but was a little marginal,\u201d said Marcia Ely, who organized the exhibition with the help of the Attie family.Eli Attie, David\u2019s son, was an adolescent when his father died in 1982. He knew of the work, which often took place in their home studio, but only recently did he realize the extent of the archive and the number of 20th-century luminaries his father photographed.

So Eli commented: \u201cDavid Attie was a direct relative of mine. He actually left commercial illustration in the 1950s, as it began to fade, and became a fairly successful commercial photographer.\u201dThey met at Eli\u2019s childhood home, a townhouse in Manhattan where his mother, the painter Dotty Attie, still lives.Mr. Attie used his iPhone to take some photos of framed prints around the house, and he sent them to some gallery curators. \u201cIf anyone responded,\u201d he said, \u201cit was with a brutal rejection.\u201dHe was told that if he wanted his father\u2019s work to get any attention, he would need to gather any photos he could of famous people. In searching, he found surprising photographs and undeveloped outtakes. When Mr. Attie was younger, \u201cI didn\u2019t give his work much thought,\u201d he said. As an adult looking in earnest, he was impressed to find his father\u2019s photos of the Band, Leonard Bernstein and Bobby Fischer, among others.He also found an envelope that said \u201cHoliday, Capote, A3/58.\u201d\u201cFor me, it was just another celebrity,\u201d Mr. Attie said of the discovery. But then he bought the February 1959 issue of Holiday, which included some of the photos his father took for the Capote essay \u201cA House on the Heights,\u201d famous for its opening line, provocative at the time: \u201cI live in Brooklyn. By choice.\u201dIt\u2019s possible that \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d played a role in the photographer\u2019s hiring for the magazine piece.Mr. Brodovitch hired David Attie to illustrate \u201cTiffany\u2019s\u201d with montages of images layered upon one another, the elder Mr. Attie\u2019s signature style at the New School. But Bazaar pulled out. Capote sold the story to Esquire, and wrote in a letter to its fiction editor, L. Rust Hills, \u201cI would not be interested if you did not use Attie\u2019s photographs.\u201d Esquire published only one of the montages \u2014 \u201ca laughing girl with an El Morocco background,\u201d in Capote\u2019s words \u2014 but that, Eli said, helped his father\u2019s career take shape.Did the writer and the photographer keep in touch after Capote\u2019s essay was published? The unanswered questions have piled up.One day, Angela Hederman, who published the book of Capote\u2019s essay with David Attie\u2019s work, pointed to a photo and asked Eli, \u201cIs that W. E. B. Du Bois?\u201dThe mysteries continue with each newly opened box of negatives, which fill several closets from floor to ceiling. The whole process, Mr. Attie said, is \u201ca conversation with my father, and I get to sort of be there with him, in many cases before I was born.\u201dAnd, with the book and exhibition, he is beginning to raise his father\u2019s profile.\u201cPart of what I always sought for him was a little bit of legitimacy,\u201d Mr. Attie said. \u201cIt\u2019s all getting a little closer to that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Testing Sites for Self-Driving Cars Become a Priority", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Spurred by the fatal crash of a driver operating his Tesla Motors car in Autopilot mode, lawmakers and car executives are urging the Transportation Department to intensify the testing of self-driving vehicles.Three Michigan lawmakers, Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow and Representative Debbie Dingell, are pushing for a testing center, overseen by the federal government, that would enable automakers and regulators to collaborate on the development of autonomous vehicles and validate their reliability and safety.The three met here on Friday with the nation\u2019s transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, and the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Mark R. Rosekind.\u201cWe know we need a national testing and validation site,\u201d Senator Peters said at an automotive digital security conference here. \u201cWe need one in place where all the auto companies can come together.\u201dThe senator said such a facility was needed to help keep the United States competitive in the race to develop the self-driving cars of the future. China, Japan, Germany and Sweden are also rushing to set up testing centers.The early trials of autonomous technology typically have taken place in closed proving grounds that automakers have used for decades. But more and more, testing is being done on public roads.Google\u2019s fleet of driverless test cars has logged more than 1.5 million miles driving in California and elsewhere. General Motors has outfitted a small number of Chevrolet Bolt electric cars with autonomous technology and is \u201crunning them around San Francisco,\u201d Mary Barra, the company\u2019s chief executive, said. Ford Motor is assembling a fleet of 30 self-driving cars that will be tested on public roads.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is being developed as customers are using it. The company describes its launch of the technology as only a \u201cbeta\u201d test, and says it is gathering data from vehicles equipped with it to perfect the system.The fatal Tesla crash, which occurred on May 7 but was first made public by the highway safety agency on June 30, \u201cheightens the need\u201d for a cooperative test center, Senator Peters said.Mr. Brown was in his 2015 Tesla Model S, traveling about 65 miles per hour, when it crashed into a tractor-trailer crossing the roadway in Williston, Fla. Tesla, whose vehicles have the ability to send the company data on their operating conditions, has said that the Autopilot was engaged at the time, and that neither Mr. Brown nor the system activated the brakes before impact.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system scans the road with radar and cameras, but it failed to see the white truck against a bright sky, according to the company. The highway safety agency is investigating whether the incident resulted from a flaw in Tesla\u2019s technology. The National Transportation Safety Board, which more often looks into airplane and train accidents, is also investigating the crash.At the Billington Global Automotive Cybersecurity Summit here, Mr. Rosekind, the highway safety administrator, declined to comment on his agency\u2019s investigation. But he said he believed autonomous-driving technology could eventually save thousands of lives and wants carmakers to continue developing it rapidly.\u201cThere will be incidents, but we can\u2019t wait for the perfect,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Mr. Foxx confirmed that the secretary met with the Michigan representatives on Friday. Their proposal to initiate a competition among facilities to be chosen as a national testing center is under consideration, the spokesman said.Senator Peters said a national testing center was critical to accelerating development of the technology while minimizing the risk of accidents. He and Representative Dingell urged Mr. Foxx and Mr. Rosekind to solicit proposals from potential test sites.The Willow Run site is much larger and would allow automakers to test self-driving cars at highway speeds and in more complex environments. Its roadways include overpasses and bridges.The Willow Run location in Michigan is close to technical centers operated by several automakers, including G.M., Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai. Google\u2019s self-driving car test is also opening an engineering center in Michigan.Senator Peters said the concentration of automotive companies would make the Willow Run complex a top choice for the kind of national center he is advocating.An article on Saturday about a search by the federal government and the automobile industry for a testing site for autonomous vehicles misidentified the company that made bombers during World War II on a Michigan site that is in contention. It was Ford Motor \u2014 not General Motors, which bought the site in the 1950s.Advertisement"}

Often times, the work he shares is grotesque but impossible to ignore. Twice a month, he posts personal ads from international male escorts, young men detailing what they like to do sexually, what they will allow to be done to them, a display that is hypnotic and disturbing.Then there are the collections of interesting things \u2014 demolished mansions, revolving restaurants, ruined flesh, miniature golf courses, fireworks displays, dioramas, amusement park rides. It\u2019s never just a handful of images \u2014 it\u2019s 40, 50, more. The sheer quantity becomes thrilling. Mr. Cooper\u2019s blog also hosts one of the best comment sections on the internet, with a real community of people who engage one another and the art, with none of the blunt ignorance found in most comment sections.Mr. Cooper\u2019s is not the only blog that has been deleted over the years. There are reports here and there across the internet about blogs, mostly, being deleted for violations of Terms of Service. What is happening to Mr. Cooper, though, in terms of lack of an explanation, seems to be unprecedented, and he has, as of yet, the highest profile of those who have experienced this measure of data loss.Google\u2019s relative silence is deafening and disturbing. Mr. Cooper is reluctant to call this deletion censorship, but given the nature of his work that is what it feels like. Regardless, Google\u2019s actions here suggest that some boundaries shouldn\u2019t be challenged. That\u2019s a shame. There is a wide range of art in the world, but there is an urgent need for art that pushes us and makes us uncomfortable because it forces us to think, to question, to give into it, to resist.The scholar Langdon Winner has written extensively about technological progress without consideration of the consequences of adopting technology. Professor Winner coined the term \u201cmythinformation,\u201d the wishful thinking that with open access to technology, the world will become a better place. He has written of \u201ccomputer enthusiasts,\u201d that they feel there is \u201cno need to try and shape the institutions of the information age in ways that maximize human freedom while placing limits upon concentrations of power.\u201d The deletion of Mr. Cooper\u2019s blog is, perhaps, evidence of what happens when we don\u2019t try to limit concentrations of power.What is far more disturbing than the transgressive work of Dennis Cooper is the cold reality of technological progress. The idea of a cloud benevolently storing our personal information, our work, our photos, our music, so much of our lives, is also really nice, but as users, we have no control over the cloud.When we use their services, we trust that companies like Google will preserve some of the most personal things we have to share.

{"Headline": "Tor Project, a Digital Privacy Group, Reboots With New Board", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Tor Project, a nonprofit digital privacy group, on Wednesday replaced its board with a new slate of directors as part of a larger shake-up after allegations of sexual misconduct by a prominent employee.The Tor Project promotes the use of software that helps internet users mask their online identities and whereabouts; the software was developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory nearly 20 years ago. The group has become better known in the last few years, as Tor is regarded as a useful tool to evade online tracking and government surveillance.But the Tor Project has been plagued by controversy, most recently involving allegations of sexual misconduct by Jacob Appelbaum, the 33-year-old public face of Tor, who was asked to step down from the group in May.Last December, the Tor Project appointed a new executive director, Shari Steele, partly to help restructure the group. She had previously spent 15 years as the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Mr. Appelbaum has dodged allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct for years, and was suspended for two weeks last spring because of accusations of harassment. In May, new revelations of sexual misconduct emerged, and Ms. Steele led a push for Mr. Appelbaum\u2019s resignation. She said the Tor Project had been working with an independent investigator to look into the claims.After the controversy, all seven of Tor\u2019s board members agreed to give up their seats to make room for a new slate. In a joint statement on Wednesday, they said, \u201cIt is time that we pass the baton of board oversight as the Tor Project moves into its second decade of operations.\u201dSince taking the Tor Project\u2019s helm, Ms. Steele has replaced its directors of human resources and administration, moved the project\u2019s base of operations to Seattle from Cambridge, Mass., recruited the new slate of directors, and searched for additional, alternative sources of funding.Tor has received funding from private companies and nonprofits, including Google and Human Rights Watch, but 90 percent of its funding comes from government contracts and grants. That is a controversial source of funds for an organization that counts dissidents and activists looking to avoid government reprisals among its primary user base.In an interview, Ms. Steele said the board moves were intended to \u201cbring in a strong, leadership-oriented board with more experience leading a strong and sustainable organization.\u201d Recruiting new members, she said, had not been a challenge.\u201cAll of them had been watching what was going on with Tor and were committed and enthusiastic about growing this into a stronger and sustainable organization,\u201d she said.The departing directors are Meredith Hoban Dunn, Ian Goldberg, Julius Mittenzwei, Rabbi Rob Thomas, Wendy Seltzer and two of Tor\u2019s co-founders, Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson. Mr. Dingledine and Mr. Mathewson will remain as leaders of Tor\u2019s technical research and development.Their successors include Matt Blaze, a widely known cryptographer and associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania; Cindy Cohn, Ms. Steele\u2019s successor as executive director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation; Bruce Schneier, a security author and expert; Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist at McGill University who writes about online activism; Linus Nordberg, a longtime internet and privacy activist; and Megan Price, executive director of the Human Rights Data Analysis Group. The remaining board seat has yet to be filled.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the university where Gabriella Coleman is an anthropologist. It is McGill University, not the University of McGill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leave London After \u2018Brexit\u2019? Steve Cohen Doubles Down", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 As some financial companies consider moving jobs out of London after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen\u2019s firm, Point72 Asset Management, is taking a contrarian view.The firm \u2014 a family office that manages Mr. Cohen\u2019s $11 billion fortune and the personal money of some of its employees \u2014 has doubled the size of its work force in London in the last six weeks after reopening its office here last year.Point72 also is raising its public profile \u2014 including a move into social media \u2014 as it looks to attract its next generation of portfolio managers and analysts in the United States, Asia and Europe.Marc Desmidt, who was recently named Point72\u2019s head of international strategy, said in an interview that London would continue to be a magnet for talent in the fund industry. \u201cTo the extent that some people may be working for firms that are slightly ambiguous in terms of their commitment to London, we see that as an opportunity to stand fast and talk to more people.\u201dPoint72, based in Stamford, Conn., does not manage money for outside investors, and is ineligible to do so until at least 2018 because of a regulatory agreement.William R. Tovey, the new head of Point72\u2019s London office, said in an interview that the market upheaval created by the Brexit vote on June 23 had created investment opportunities, particularly for Point72\u2019s new financial team, which joined the company this month.\u201cIt is an interesting time for them to be looking at opportunities with a clean sheet of paper, without maybe a lot of the baggage that many members of the market are currently carrying,\u201d Mr. Tovey said.Mr. Tovey joined Point72 about two months ago from Barclays, where he was head of its European equities distribution business. He previously worked at UBS and Mercury Asset Management.Simon Head, the head of the financial services practice at the recruitment firm Pure Search in London, said that it was not a particularly buoyant year for hiring in the financial services sector, but that he had not seen financial firms instituting broad hiring freezes since the Brexit referendum.Asset managers who had plans to increase the size of their businesses in London, similar to Point72, are moving ahead with their projects \u201con the basis that this is a long-term business,\u201d Mr. Head said.Oliver Rolfe, the founder and managing director of the executive search firm Spartan Partnership in London, said that the largest global banks had postponed hiring plans and might cut jobs later this year, while smaller firms might wait until fall before moving forward with new hires. Companies, in general, are acting slowly and cautiously in this environment, he said.\u201cIf there are special talent available that a company could hire, that hire will still happen,\u201d Mr. Rolfe said. \u201cThe difficulty now is the quality that is required to make the hires happen is far, far higher than it would be maybe two months ago. If you\u2019re making the very best hire, even in the worst market, you\u2019re still helping the business.\u201dAfter the name change, the company found that potential candidates \u2014 particularly those with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills \u2014 were not as aware of the firm or its philosophy.The company has started a 12-month training program, called Point72 Academy, to teach recent college graduates financial analysis and investment research skills. About 2,000 people applied for this year\u2019s program, and 12 candidates are expected to start at Point72 later this summer. Even more applicants are expected in 2017.Point72 plans to expand its academy to include potential candidates based in Britain and Asia as part of its 2017 class.It also has a 10-week summer analyst program to help undergraduates develop skills that are considered fundamental to its investment process. The firm has 18 undergraduates in its summer analyst program this year.In the hope of attracting candidates who might be considering financial jobs in Silicon Valley, Point72 has added career pages on LinkedIn, Facebook and Google Plus, and is taking out sponsored advertisements on LinkedIn.In the next few months, Point72 also plans to unveil its own YouTube channel, which will feature a series of videos to help potential job seekers understand the firm and what it\u2019s like to work there. The channel is expected to debut on Twitter in the fall.The expansion of the London office has also come as Point72 expands around the world despite not being able to accept outside money until 2018, a condition of its settlement with the S.E.C. earlier this year.The firm is in the process of increasing the size of its Singapore operations and intends to move its New York offices to a new tower in the Hudson Yards redevelopment on Manhattan\u2019s West Side by the end of 2018.\u201cI fully expect that this office can double in size,\u201d Mr. Tovey said, regarding the potential for expansion in London. \u201cThere\u2019s no urgency to do that. The focus is on quality. We still believe that we\u2019ve got a business, an infrastructure and a proposition that is attractive to the most talented people in the market.\u201dNo decision has been made on whether Point72 will seek outside investors once the regulatory restrictions are lifted, said Mr. Desmidt, who also oversees the firm\u2019s three offices in Asia.In April, Mr. Cohen formed a new firm called Stamford Harbor Capital, which can, if it chooses, accept outside capital. For now, no decisions have been made.In keeping with his agreement with the S.E.C., Mr. Cohen will not have a supervisory role with the new firm. Under the agreement, Mr. Cohen would be able to manage outside money and act in a supervisory role again beginning in January 2018.\u201cWhat I say to people is part of my role is to ensure that we have world-class investors and a world-class operating infrastructure, that should we choose to take outside capital, we\u2019ll pass any kind of due diligence on the back of that,\u201d Mr. Desmidt said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Competition in Tatters, the Rip of Inequality Widens", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe Justice Department is expected to rule soon on the biggest beer merger ever: a $100 billion-plus combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller into a colossus that will reap some $3 out of every $10 spent on beer around the world.The stakes are higher than whether you will be able to find your favorite Belgian-style lambic at the corner store. The new merger amounts to another step in the long decline of competition in many American industries.It is a decline that stunts entrepreneurship, hinders workers\u2019 mobility and slows productivity growth. Slowing this trend has emerged as a tempting new avenue to address the plight of a beleaguered working class. Reviving flagging American competition might even help stop America\u2019s ever-widening inequality.Monopoly rents \u2014 the excess returns a company reaps when it does not have to deal with pesky competitors keeping prices down \u2014 could worsen inequality in a variety of ways. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate from Columbia University who served as top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, has asserted that exorbitant corporate profits are being run up through oligopolies and passed along to stockholders, raising the share of national income accruing to the rich.This may not fit snugly with the data, though. Notably, the rising share of income going to the top 1 percent is not driven mainly by overstuffed returns on investment but by the growing inequality in wages. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag suggest a different mechanism to fit this trend: Companies that reap monopoly rents are paying their workers more, sharing some of their rents with them. While that might sound a bit more egalitarian, it could be equally insidious.There is plenty of evidence that corporate concentration is on the rise. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag report that between 1997 and 2007 the market share of the 50 largest companies increased in three-fourths of the broad industry sectors followed by the census.In 1985 the top 10 banks had under 20 percent of banking assets. By 2010 they had more than half. Big Pharma too has become bigger, buying niche laboratories. So have hospitals: Between 2010 and 2014 there were 457 mergers in the hospital sector.Studies have found increased concentration in agricultural businesses and wireless communications as well. And as Senator Warren observed, critical technology markets are often controlled by a single player. Among airlines, there are only four major United States carriers left.Martin Gaynor, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief economist at the Federal Trade Commission, noted that competition policy was about increasing the economy\u2019s efficiency, not changing the distribution of the spoils. \u201cI don\u2019t think antitrust is a major tool for addressing inequality,\u201d he told me.Still, it would seem foolhardy to ignore the growing footprint of dominant companies, strutting their stuff across the broader economy.The existence of Facebook might provide an incentive for some kid in a garage to design a cool new app for the social media giant. But Facebook might also have an interest in squelching innovations that do not fit its business model.Market power can throw sand in the economy\u2019s cogs in several ways. For one, it will make more sense for dominant companies to focus on protecting their rents than to risk money investing in new ventures. New entrepreneurs will think twice before trying to challenge a dominant firm.How did the American economy get so concentrated? Technology surely helped. Tech giants like Google and Facebook benefit from economies of scale and network effects. It costs nothing to serve an additional search. Consumers will be drawn to the social media platforms that already have more users.Government watchdogs also messed up. Concerned only about local competition between bank branches, they allowed a huge nationwide concentration. \u201cAntitrusters stood by and sucked their thumbs while these mergers got through,\u201d Professor Scherer told me. Conditions imposed on troublesome mergers \u2014 like orders to sell assets or to refrain from certain behaviors \u2014 were mostly ineffective, Professor Kwoka said.How to fix it? Professor Kwoka suggests that when a given industry is already fairly concentrated, any future merger should be presumed to be anticompetitive, taking the burden of proof off the regulator\u2019s shoulders and putting the onus on the merging companies to prove it is not. Regulations also offer a promising tool: How about demanding that the Food and Drug Administration approve generic drugs more quickly?But what might help most is not some narrow change in the procedures to examine business combinations but a broadening of the objectives of competition policy. Antitrust economists might hate this idea, but perhaps it\u2019s time to broaden the discussion beyond how a decline in competition may hurt consumers, and to consider things other than narrow economic efficiency. That would include the way market concentration affects the distribution of the fruits of economic growth. It\u2019s not just about the price of beer.Advertisement"}

Yes, some foods, like kale, apples and oatmeal, are considered \u201chealthy\u201d by nearly everyone. And some, like soda, french fries and chocolate chip cookies, are not.

{"Headline": "Two Middle-Grade Novels Set in the South", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byChildren\u2019s BooksAt some point, every child must navigate his or her own path in life. Some do this fearlessly and with gusto, while others take a more cautious approach. We can see the contrast in two new middle-grade novels set in Virginia, one historical, the other contemporary.Melia Hoyle, the narrator of Louis Bayard\u2019s sublime \u201cLucky Strikes,\u201d careens down the road of life like one of the truckers whose big rigs she handily repairs at her family-owned gas station in Walnut Ridge, Va. A true force of nature, Melia doesn\u2019t even have patience for the letter \u201cA\u201d at the front of her given name. (\u201cMama always said I was in too much of a dang hurry to be dragging all those letters after me.\u201d) So when Mama dies of \u201cbelly trouble,\u201d leaving Melia and her two younger siblings alone, Melia sprints headfirst toward a solution: She spruces up a lazy-eyed vagabond who literally rolls off the back of a coal truck and declares him Daddy. It\u2019s a \u201cbusiness arrangement,\u201d she explains to the down-on-his-luck former actor (and copywriter and hat salesman), Hiram Watts. Hiram gets a roof over his head, and Melia and her siblings evade foster care.Melia is an immediately endearing character, and her wiseacre narration is both droll and affecting. A mechanical genius who can make a pair of squeaky brakes \u201cquiet as a queen\u2019s fart\u201d with only a little castor oil, she faces her hardships \u2014 including a villainous entrepreneur hellbent on stealing the family station out from under her \u2014 with pluck and ingenuity. And the post-Prohibition setting allows Bayard, best known for his adult historical fiction, to endow his narrator with freedoms most contemporary children can only dream of. Melia, a fifth-grade dropout, drives and smokes and prepares the family\u2019s meals straight from the shelves of the station\u2019s general store. Of course, Melia is still a child. She struggles with the buddings of first romance, as well as the desperate loss of her mother. It is a lucky strike indeed that she and Hiram have plowed into each other, as each helps to soften the other\u2019s rough edges.Although it hits a jarringly dark note in its final act, \u201cLucky Strikes\u201d is a near-perfect novel, rich in voice and emotion. Much like Melia herself, it is brash with bravado, barely concealing an inviting layer of warmth at its core.If Melia hurries through life trucker style, Eugene (Genie) Harris, the 11-year-old protagonist of Jason Reynolds\u2019s \u201cAs Brave as You,\u201d prefers to bob like a raft on the ocean, observing all that goes on around him without making many waves. Genie hopes one day to be a detective, or perhaps a \u201cquestionnaire,\u201d and so keeps a small notebook that he fills with questions to Google. They run from the mundane (\u201cIf I put sugar on peas, will they taste better?\u201d) to the profound (\u201cCan you be trapped and safe at the same time?\u201d). When he and his older brother, Ernie, are shipped off to spend a month with their grandparents in rural North Hill, Va., Genie\u2019s biggest concern is the lack of Wi-Fi.Predictably, however, the Brooklyn boys unearth much to entertain them. While cool, girl-crazy Ernie befriends a girl named Tess, Genie forms a surprising bond with his Grandpop, who provides plenty of mystery for an aspiring detective. Why, for example, does a now-blind former rifleman spend so much time in his \u201cnunya bidness\u201d room, where he\u2019s made an entire \u201coutdoor\u201d oasis, complete with birds and fake grass and even a recorded breeze? As family secrets tiptoe out into the daylight, Genie comes to understand the depth of the pain his African-American Grandpop harbors from his childhood during the Jim Crow era, and discovers answers to questions he never thought to write in his notebook.Reynolds\u2019s previous books have been young adult novels (most recently \u201cAll American Boys,\u201d co-written with Brendan Kiely), and he has perhaps lowered the stakes too much for a younger audience: Genie can come across as a bit na\u00efve, and his adventures \u2014 including an attempt to trap a barn swallow and a trip to the flea market to sell peas with Grandma \u2014 are rather tame. Still, it is hard not to cheer as, in his quiet way, he forges his own course, navigating the fine line between fear and cowardice.LUCKY STRIKESBy Louis Bayard313 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $16.99.

They\u2019re back!In a hotel here on the day after Britain had voted to leave the European Union, Ms. Saunders and Ms. Lumley at first talked gloomily about the result, both expressing their disbelief at the news. But they perked up when the conversation turned to their new film, talking about their characters, changes in the fashion world and whether the world can expect more Ab-fabulousness in the future. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why an \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d movie now?You have been playing Patsy and Edina for 25 years now. What keeps drawing you back?To come back to your question, I think these characters allow you to say things you\u2019re not allowed to say. Although doing a film is very different to making a television series on that front. Everything is run through lawyers, and it\u2019s much more constraining. It was much harder for them to be outrageous. But the characters are also interesting to me now, because they\u2019re not as happy, they\u2019re not at the forefront of things. They felt more successful earlier on, more looked at. Now everyone is looking at themselves, and they don\u2019t even have a presence on social media. They don\u2019t have much of a clue.Have there been big changes in the fashion world since you started making the series?In the film, we made the fashion as British as we could. Of course Edina has always loved Vivienne Westwood, and they made a lot of outfits for her, all too small and uncomfortable. What I do for my art.Toward the end of the film, Edina has a moment of truth, and says, \u201cI know who I am.\u201d Does she?Will there be more \u201cAbsolutely Fabulous?\u201dAdvertisement"}
